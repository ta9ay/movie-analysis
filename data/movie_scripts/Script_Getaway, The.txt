TRAIN STATION - MORNINGCAROL IS STANDING IN A TICKET LINE THAT MOVES slowly foward.She struggles, clutching the heavy, money laden suitcase andher oversize purse between both arms. The line of ticketbuyers moves forward .just fast enough to make it impracticalto set the suitcase down. The station is ancient, vaultlike.Baggage lockers line the perimeter of the lobby and extendoff into clumped rows within the wings of the station.CAROL APPROACHES THE TICKET WINDOW.

As other baggage-laden passengers scurry   aroundher, she looks across the arcade, her eyes finding   a glass-walled Cocktail Lounge. She hesitates, then begins   to trudgein that direction.A BANK OF LOCKERS STANDS NEAR THE COCKTAIL LOUNGE. As Carolapproaches, an elderly WOMAN deposits a coin in one of thenumbered lockers, opens the metal door and places a smallsuitcase inside. Closing and re-locking the door, the Womanquickly moves away. Having noted the woman and more thantired of hauling her burden around the station, Carol stepsto the end locker, takes a quarter out of her purse, thenstudies the time scarred operating instructions on the faceof the locker.

In one smoothmovement the Dapper Man plucks the quarter from Carol's hand,deposits it in the slot and swings the locker door open.Setting the heavy suitcase inside, he closes the door, testsit to show that ithas been re-locked, then removes the key from the lock andputs it into Carol's hand. She is intimidated momentarily bythe Man's sudden appearance and forcefulness, as well as hisintentions.                       CAROL          Thank you.

Finally:                    RUDY          What kind of car do you have, Harold?                    FRAN              (cutting in)          A Ford... We have a Ford.                    RUDY          That's good. That's very good. Now          Harold, you go out and gas up the Ford,          check the oil and tires, we don't want          any problems on the road. One more          thing... If anybody but you comes back...He points the gun at Mrs. Clinton.

RUDY          After you come back I'll listen while you          make some phone calls, tell a few friends          you've got to leave for a week or two...          You have to call another Vet about the          animals. You tell him to come over and          take good care of them starting          tomorrow... no slip-ups on that. They got          to be looked after...                    HAROLD          We really don't have too many friends.

He just wats to meet a girl.                    CAROL              (not too patronizing)          That's right.                    SOLDIER          Me, too.

The next car holdsonly baggage. He has reached furthest forward passenger car.The Thief desperately tries to open the vestibule door,hoping to escape by jumping off the train, but the doors aretightly locked. He begins to retrace his steps.DOC MOVES CAREFULLY INTO THE NEXT CAR FORWARD, stillunknowingly two cars behind the Thief.THE THIEF PASSES BACK TO THE VESTIBULE AT THE REAR OF THESMOKER, his eye suddenly catching the Men's Lounge.

The door remains firmly shut.
