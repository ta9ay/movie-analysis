He spent eightyears in McNeil and three in San Quentin. He got out andhit the street in 1987. Four of the McNeil years werespent in the hole. Neil's voice is street, but his languageis precise like an engineer's. He's very careful and verygood. Neil runs a professional crew that pulls down highline, high number scores and does it anyway the score hasto be taken down: if on the prowl (a burglary), that'sfine; if they have to go in strong (armed), that's finetoo. And if you get in their way, that's got to be yourproblem. His lifestyle is obsessively functional. There'sno steady woman or any encumbrance.
