                          THE WHITE RIBBON                              Written by                            Michael Haneke1. COVERED RIDING SCHOOL OF THE MANORIAL ESTATE INT/DAYMONTAGE OF CLOSE-SHOTS:                                                                1A man is riding a dressage horse. We can't see his face.Only his boots, spurs, whip, the taut reins, the horse'sfoamy mouth, the movements that steer the animal.We watch him for a while and hear the SNORTS of thehorse, the dull SOUND of THE HOOVES on the ground, thefast-uttered COMMANDS of the rider. Then we start tohear a gentle voice:       NARRATOR (o.s.):I don't know if the story that I       want to tell you, reflects the truth in every       detail. Much of it I only know by hearsay, and a       lot of it remains obscure to me even today, and       I must leave it in darkness. Many of these       questions remain without answer. But I believe I       must tell of the strange events that occurred in       our village, because they may cast a new light       on some of the goings-on in this country...LONG SHOT OF THE RIDING STABLES.The rider is the village doctor, a gaunt, intellectual-looking man of around 60, who has finished his dressagesession, and now rides toward the open gate beside theCAMERA, goes through it and into the landscape. We seehim in the avenue, now visible behind him, and watch himgrow smaller until he vanishes.       NARRATOR (o.s. continuing):...Everything began,       if I remember correctly, with the doctor's       riding accident. After his dressage session in       the manor's riding school, he was first headed       for his home...                            2.   THE DOCTOR'S PROPERTY EXT/DAYThe garden opens up on the meadows and fields of theflat countryside.The doctor lies beside his wounded horse. His arm isstrangely twisted, his broken collarbone has made a bumpin the blood-drenched jacket. He yells with pain.After a few moments Xenia, the doctor's 12-year olddaughter, comes running out of the house. She rushes upto her father and looks at him, horrified, then at thetwitching horse, screams with horror. Her father shoutssomething to her, she bends over him and tries to raisehim to his feet. He screams at her as he's in such pain.She staggers back helplessly, he shouts something to heragain, whereupon she runs off. We hear all this from faraway, because during the whole scene the narrator hascontinued his tale:                                                           2       NARRATOR: ...to see if any of his patients had       arrived. As it entered the property, the horse       had tripped over a hardly visible, taut wire       that had been strung between two trees.       The doctor's fourteen-year old daughter had       watched the accident from the window of the       house, and was able to inform the woman who was       their neighbor, who in turn got the message to       the manor house, so that the agonizing doctor       could be transported to the hospital of the       district capital that was over 30 kilometers       away...                            3.   VILLAGE-STREET AND SCHOOL EXT/DAYTRACKING SHOT:Emilie Wagner, a skinny, modestly dressed woman in herlate thirties hurries along the village street.       NARRATOR: ...The neighbor, a single woman of       around 40, was the village midwife, who had       filled the invaluable position of housekeeper       and receptionist for the doctor since the death       of his wife in childbirth.       After tending to the doctor's two children, she       had gone to the school to fetch her own son,       Hans. Since she didn't like leaving him alone,       she asked me - in return for a small fee - to       keep him at the school with me every day, after       the other children had finished their lessons.       But on the day of the riding accident there was       choir practice in the afternoon, so that most of       the children were still present.A few children pass Emilie and greet her. Then shereaches the school. The door is open. The schoolchildrenstream out.We see the schoolteacher, a slight man, hardly 30 yearsold, talking inside to some of the older students.Martin, a tall gangly boy of around 12, whose elegantclothes make him stand out among the other childrencoming out of the school, turns to the midwife:        MARTIN: Were you at Xenia's place?He's interrupted by Marie, a delicate, pretty and politegirl of around 13 who has the odd characteristic ofalready behaving like an adult.        MARIE: Can't you say hello? Good afternoon, Mrs.        Wagner, excuse me.       MIDWIFE: Hello, Marie.                                                           3        MARIE: We're so worried, you know. That's why        Martin forgot his manners.        MIDWIFE: That's all right.        MARIE: How is the Doctor?        MIDWIFE: Not very well.        MARIE: Will he have to stay in the hospital?        MIDWIFE: I don't know.The midwife is tired of Marie's precocious and endlessquestions. She peers over the heads of childrensurrounding them, looking for someone in the classroom.        MARIE: We'll take care of Xenia. Maybe, we can        help her somehow.        MIDWIFE (distracted): Good idea. It'll cheer her        up.She has seen her son, who's coming out of the door: heis a mongoloid boy of 8. His name is Hans. He hesitates,as he sees his mother surrounded by the others. Themidwife leaves the group and goes over to him.        MIDWIFE: Well, did you enjoy the singing?        HANS (nods eagerly): It was great!The schoolteacher comes in.        SCHOOLTEACHER: Show your mother what you've been        singing.Hans looks doubtfully, first at the schoolteacher, thenat his mother, who nods at him encouragingly. Afterhesitating for a second, he starts to SING:        HANS: La... La... lalala...MARIE turns to leave.        MARIE: Good-bye, Sir. Good-bye, Mrs. Wagner.Her saying good-bye acts as an invitation to the otherchildren: they also SAY GOOD-BYE, though some lessdistinctively, and follow the girl.TRACKING SHOT with the children. After a short distance,Georg, a strong boy of around 13, shouts, encouragingthe others:        GEORG: Last one is a rotten egg!                                                           4Then he sprints off. Most of the children follow him.But Marie and some of the other kids merely walk off ata brisk pace.The CAMERA, that stopped when Georg ran off, now FOLLOWSMarie, so that, after a while, the others can be seenagain at the far end of the street.                            4.   THE DOCTOR'S HOUSE INT/DAYXenia, who is herself in a pitiful condition, holds herfour-year-old brother Rudolph on her knees. She rockshim and herself back and forth. As his head is bowed, wecan only guess that he's crying. After a while        XENIA (quietly): If you want, I can cut out some        animals for you, as I did last week?No reaction.        Would you like that?!Rudolph shakes his head faintly.        We could color them together, no?No reaction.        Or we could cut them from the lovely colored        paper? The golden one, do you remember? The one        I got for Easter?No reaction. Xenia ends up pressing her head helplesslyagainst her little brother's head and mutters:        Come on, come on.They remain that way for a while. Finally Xenia raisesRudolph high enough so she can stand up:       All right! Now I'm going to make us something to       eat. Mrs. Wagner has prepared everything, I...       RUDOLPH (interrupts her softly, his head still       bowed): What if he never comes back?        XENIA (as if she hasn't understood): What?Rudolph merely shakes his bowed head. Xenia kneels downin front of her brother and tries to look into his eyes,but the boy bows his head even deeper.        XENIA (tenderly): Come on! Don't be stupid! It        goes away just like the flu. Remember last        winter? You were very sick, weren't you? And        then, two weeks later...A NOISE makes her cock her ear: it's as if something hadhit the window in the next room.                                                           5Xenia stands up and listens. SILENCE. And then, afterlistening for a while, once again the same noise.        XENIA: Hush!She goes into the OTHER ROOM and, hiding behind thecurtain, looks out.Outside, the group of children are gathered aroundMarie. They look up at the house. They're waiting forsomething.After a while, Georg, the boy who earlier had urged themto race, throws another stone at the window. Xenia isstartled. She hesitates. Finally, she opens the window.        GEORG: Hi, Xeni!Xenia doesn't answer. After a while        MARIE(quietly): How are you? Can we help you?                            5.   MANOR EXT/NIGHTThe steward of the estate, a heavy set rustic man in hismid fifties, is talking with the landowner (who's aboutthe same age). They are standing beside a team ofcarthorses. With a torch the steward lights up a deadhorse that lies on the ground after being towed in bythe carthorses.        STEWARD: ...its tendons were almost severed. It        never would have recovered.The landowner bends down and examines the wounds on thepasterns of the dead animal's front legs.        LANDOWNER: How did that thing get there? Didn't        the Doctor say anything?       STEWARD (with a snicker): He was in no mood to       talk, with his collarbone sticking out of his       throat. I asked his daughter. She has no idea.       He always rides through those trees.       LANDOWNER: Did you look at the wire?       STEWARD: Of course. It's thin, but strong. You       can hardly see it, if you don't look closely.       LANDOWNER: But why was it tied there?       STEWARD (shrugging): And at knee height! I don't       know... Maybe so the kids could jump over it. No       idea. I don't think the doctor himself was       stupid enough to tie that thing there.       LANDOWNER: Meaning?                                                           6       STEWARD: Meaning: I don't know. Anyway it was       definitely put there intentionally and looks       damn...                            6.   MANOR. LIVING ROOM ON THE TOP FLOOR. INT/NIGHTSigi, the 9-year old son of the landowner stands at thewindow, and watches his father and the steward standingin the torchlight beside the dead horse.In the background MUSIC (Piano/violin).After a short while the two men down in the courtyardseparate: the landowner heads to the manor, the stewardwith the team of carthorses to a farm building.Sigi turns away from the window and looks into the room.There his mother Beatrix, a beautiful, nervous woman inher late thirties, is sitting at a baby grand piano.Beside her stands the tutor, holding a violin tuckedunder his chin. He looks as if he's in his latetwenties, plump and slightly greasy, and obviouslyinfatuated with his beautiful employer, who has justinterrupted her playing with an annoyed sigh.        TUTOR: I'm sorry, Madame. You're just playing        too well for me.       BEATRIX:   Stop  apologizing   and  concentrate.       That'll be more helpful for both of us.        TUTOR: To tell the truth: You're just playing        too fast for me. I'm not Paganini.Beatrix looks up at him with a quick amused smile, thenturns back the pages of her sheet music.        BEATRIX: Well, let's start all over again at the        letter D.The tutor does the same, they glance at each other andstart again.Sigi watches them from the window, then he saunters in,stops some distance away and watches. Then he sauntersaway again.Suddenly, Beatrix stops playing again.        BEATRIX: Listen, darling. If you like the music,        then sit down beside me and turn the pages of        the sheet music. But if you're bored, go up to        your room and at least stay out of my sight. It        makes me nervous if you're constantly sauntering        around in front of me.Sigi bows his head ashamed, but doesn't move.        BEATRIX (turning to the tutor): By the way, what        time is it? Where is the girl?The tutor pulls out his pocket watch.                                                           7       TUTOR: She's with the twins, I presume. Twenty       to nine.       BEATRIX: Twenty to nine?! (turning to Sigi): You       should have been in bed long ago. (to the       tutor): Has he done his homework?       TUTOR: Of course, Madame.        BEATRIX: All right. (to Sigi): Well, do you want        to turn the pages for me or not?Sigi nods.        BEATRIX: Then come here!With a little caustic smile, she taps beside her on thepiano bench. Sigi comes over sits down beside her andlooks at the sheet music. Beatrix turns the pages back.        BEATRIX (to the tutor): All right, here we go        again: the letter D. Try to play a bit faster.        Or else I might as well play with the village        schoolteacher.They PLAY again. Sigi reads the music with her, thenturns the page.                            7.   RECTORY. DINING ROOM. INT/NIGHTMarie and Martin come through the door and stand infront of it.At the dinner table, the pastor (in his mid-forties)sits with his back to the door. In front of him, at theother end of the table, sits his wife Anna, a woman inher late forties. On the sides of the table sit thechildren:Anton (11), Magdalena (10), Katharina (9) and Florian(7). Two other places are empty.The table is set for 8 people, but the plates are empty.SILENCE.         MARIE (quietly): Please forgive us.        MARTIN (following her lead): Please forgive us.SILENCE. Then the pastor speaks very quietly, withoutturning to the two children:       PASTOR: There's no question of forgiving. You       haven't offended me. It's your mother and your       brothers and sisters that you have frightened       away and offended. Ask them for forgiveness.       You amaze me. I didn't know that the two oldest       and therefore most reasonable of my children       wouldn't mind frightening their mother and       brothers and sisters to death.                                                           8He turns around toward the two children:        Are you now grown up enough to live on your own?        Are you? Do you want to leave home and start a        life of your own? So you can come and go as you        please, and nobody gets in your way. Is that        what you want?The two remain silent, their heads bowed. The pastorturns his back to them again, and faces the table.       Nobody at this table has eaten tonight. When it       grew dark, and you hadn't returned, your mother       went all over the village in tears, looking for       you. Do you really think we could've enjoyed our       meal, if we feared something had happened to       you?       Do you think we can enjoy our meal now, when       you've come back and dish up lies as an excuse?       I don't know what's worse: your absence or your       coming back. (PAUSE).       Tonight we shall all go to bed hungry.He stands up, followed by the mother and the childrenwho were sitting at the table. Again he turns to the twowrongdoers:        PASTOR: You probably agree with me, that I        cannot leave your offense unpunished, if we want        keep living in mutual respect. So, tomorrow        evening at this hour, I shall give each of you        10 strokes of the cane. Until then, you have        time to ponder over your offense. Do you agree        with me?       MARIE and MARTIN: Yes, Father.        PASTOR: All right then. Go to bed now, all of        you.The children who were sitting at the table go first totheir mother, then to their father. They kiss theirhands and leave the room. As Marie and Martin want to dothe same, the father says        PASTOR: I refuse to be touched by you. Your        mother and I will sleep poorly because we know I        have to hurt you tomorrow, and because it will        more painful to us than the strokes will be        painful to you. Leave us alone and go to bed.As the two children are about to leave the room, he says        PASTOR: When you were small, your mother once in        a while would tie a ribbon in your hair or        around your arm. Its white color was to remind        you of innocence and purity. I thought that at        your age you were well-mannered enough to get by        without such reminders. I was wrong. Tomorrow,        once you've been purified by your punishment,                                                           9        your mother will tie such a ribbon on you again,        and you'll wear it until your behavior shows us        that we can trust you again.                               8.    THE DOCTOR'S PROPERTY EXT/DAYCLOSE ANGLE: one of the trees to which the wire was tiedthat tripped up the doctor's horse. A policeman islooking for clues.With him are Xenia, Rudolph, the midwife and her sonHans.The    two  boys   don't  show   much  interest  in   theinvestigation. They run after each other in the gardenand the neighboring fields. Hans especially seems enjoythis, and is shrieking with delight.         POLICEMAN: Where is the wire now?The midwife looks at Xenia, who shrugs her shoulders.         POLICEMAN: Then who took it away?        XENIA: I don't know.        POLICEMAN: You weren't here?Xenia, uncertain, looks at the midwife.        POLICEMAN:   Did   you   accompany   your   father?   To        town?        XENIA: No.        POLICEMAN: That means you were here.        XENIA: I was in school. Today.        POLICEMAN: And when you left for school, the        wire was still here?        XENIA: I didn't check.The policeman turns to the midwife:        POLICEMAN: And when did you come?        MIDWIFE: At noon. I make lunch for the Doctor        and the kids. Since the death of the Doctor's        wife, I've been helping him out.        POLICEMAN: Since when?                                                                   10        MIDWIFE: It's been 4 years. Since the birth of        little Rudolph. I'm the midwife here. We often        work together.        POLICEMAN: But you didn't see anything?        MIDWIFE: No.        POLICEMAN: Do you have any idea how long the        wire had been there?        MIDWIFE: I'd never seen it before.         POLICEMAN (angrily): Let me get this straight:         Nobody saw the thing before, nobody saw it         afterwards. It wound itself around the two trees         all alone, and made itself vanish after the         doctor's fall. Right?Neither the midwife nor Xenia know what to answer. Atthat moment Hans comes running in from the field,excited:         HANS: Mother! ... Look! ...Look... come!        MIDWIFE (reluctantly): What's happening?        HANS: People! ...Lots of people. Come!!        MIDWIFE (to the policeman): Sorry...Indeed, as the midwife sets outs for the field, a groupof people hurry along the path bordering the doctor'sproperty, and cross our POV. They carry a body on amakeshift stretcher. The policeman and Xenia follow themidwife. The group vanishes as quickly as it appearedbehind the surrounding bushes.As the group was approaching, we have been hearing        NARRATOR: The day following the doctor's riding        accident not only brought no solution to the        question of who'd done it, but a second, far        more tragic incident almost made people forget        the misfortune of the previous day: the wife of        a tenant farmer died in a work-accident.                            9.   FARM INT/DAYIt's very dark in the low-ceilinged room. Small windows.A couple of women in peasant dresses take care of thedead woman, who's been laid out on the bed. The womenremove her clothes and wash her.        NARRATOR: The woman, who because of an injured        arm could only do light work, had been dispensed                                                            11         by the steward from harvesting chores, and was         assigned to easier work in the sawmill.Everything happens very silently. An elderly woman, amidwife specialized in bathing, takes care of theproceedings.Every time the door is opened, one hears the mutteringsof the people waiting outside. Soiled water is carriedout, new underwear brought in, and the women start toclothe the naked corpse again.Outside, the sounds of excited VOICES are gettinglouder. Then the door opens and the farmer (aroundfifty) enters the room. The old midwife turns aroundangrily:         BATHING-MIDWIFE: You stay outside! I haven't         yet...        FARMER (quietly): Get out!Reluctantly, the old midwife abandons her half completedwork, not without having spread the dress she had drapedover the still half-naked body of the dead woman. Theother women follow her, embarrassed.Once the door has closed behind them, the farmer juststands there. Only after a long while does he moveforward and sit beside his dead wife. He remains seated,motionless. For a very long time. He only tugs once atthe dress draped over the half-naked body, as if hewanted to cover a patch of nudity. Then he just sitsthere again in the dark room, and only his haltingbreath lets us know that any moment he may cry.                            10. A RIVER AND MEADOW WITH BRIDGE EXT/DAYWith his net and his fishing rod the schoolteacher islanding a fish.        NARRATOR: On the same day, I had a strange        encounter: the weather was beautiful and hot, so        I decided to try and improve my meager menu with        some brown trout, which are plentiful in the        river. The landowner apparently liked me, and        allowed me to fish.Suddenly, the schoolteacher stops dead: like a tightropewalker Martin is walking along on the top of the wall ofthe bridge, thirty feet above the riverbed.        SCHOOLTEACHER (shouts, fearful): Martin!The boy doesn't seem to hear him and keeps up hisbalancing act.        SCHOOLTEACHER (louder): Martin!!The boy keeps at it.                                                           12The schoolteacher quickly wades ashore, throws hisfishing rod and the net and the wriggling fish on thegravel beside the river and climbs up the river bank.When he gets on top, he sees the boy balancing himselfat the other end of the bridge.        SCHOOLTEACHER: Martin, be careful!The boy takes a few more steps, then reaches the end ofthe wall and jumps down onto the bridge. Hesitatingly,he turns to the schoolteacher, who comes toward him.        SCHOOLTEACHER: Are you completely insane? ! Do        you want to break your neck? !        MARTIN (his head bowed): Hello, sir.The schoolteacher has reached him.        SCHOOLTEACHER: What's happening? Are you mad? !        Don't you know how high that is?The boy remains silent, keeping his head bent down.        SCHOOLTEACHER: Didn't you hear me? I shouted to        you.         MARTIN (after a short silence): Yes, I did.        SCHOOLTEACHER: Well?The boy remains silent.        SCHOOLTEACHER: Well?!!Keeping his head bowed, the boy shrugs a little. Theschoolteacher, realizing that this won't get him anyfurther, tries again, talking in a gentle voice:        SCHOOLTEACHER: You saw me down there and wanted        to impress me?The boy shakes his head.        SCHOOLTEACHER: Well, why didn't you...         MARTIN   (interrupting  him) I  gave  God  an         opportunity to kill me. He didn't do it. That         means, he's pleased with me.         SCHOOLTEACHER (staggered): What are you saying?         MARTIN: He doesn't want me to die.         SCHOOLTEACHER (bewildered):   Who?   Who   doesn't         want you to die?         MARTIN: God.Pause.        SCHOOLTEACHER: Why would God want you to die?The boy stops answering, his head bowed again. Theschoolteacher remains silent and looks at him for awhile. Then, he adds softly:                                                              13        Promise me never to do such nonsense again. All        right? Look at me.Martin looks up reluctantly.        Promise it to me.Martin remains silent. He doesn't dare look down, andinstead looks past the schoolteacher.        You don't trust me, don't you?        MARTIN (polite, emotionless): Yes, I do, Sir.The schoolteacher realizes that there's no use intalking any further.        SCHOOLTEACHER (concluding): All right. Go home        now. I'll be coming tomorrow for the piano        lesson. I'll talk to your father then.Martin turns and faces the schoolteacher, and says insuch a pleading voice that it startles him:        MARTIN: Please, don't tell him! Please, sir,        don't!        SCHOOLTEACHER: Why?Martin just looks pleadingly at the schoolteacher andshakes his head, as if to stress his request.                            11. SAWMILL INT/DAYFranz, the farmer eldest son, is searching for evidenceof his mother's accident. He is accompanied by theneighbor's son Matti, a slight boy of around 16.The sawmill is a ramshackle wooden building beside theriver.Matti, who obviously was there when the accidenthappened, shows Franz the place.        MATTI: There. Be careful. Everything's rotten        here.Franz moves slowly forward. He looks down at the lowerfloor. Immediately below: the saw. Franz steps backcarefully and turns to Matti:        FRANZ: Who made her climb up here?       MATTI: I haven't a clue. They told us to collect       all the lose ends. She just climbed up there.       FRANZ: She could never stand heights. It made       her dizzy.       Who assigned you to this job?       MATTI (uneasy): You know how it works. The       sawmill needed to be cleaned up, and the foremen       pick the weaker harvesters                                                          14        FRANZ: Who picked her?                               12. STREET AT THE END OF THE VILLAGE EXT/DAY.The schoolteacher with his fishing gear and several fishthat he caught.        NARRATOR: It was on my way home after the        strange encounter with Martin that I met Eva for        the first time.Eva (18), a redhead, somewhat chubby, but pretty girl,crosses him way on her bicycle. A big bag is strapped tothe baggage carrier.        SCHOOLTEACHER: Hello.        EVA (passing by): Hello.The schoolteacher stops, turns to the girl:        SCHOOLTEACHER (hesitantly): Excuse me!        EVA (Off): Yes?        SCHOOLTEACHER   (embarrassed):  Excuse   me   for        accosting you this way. You're the new nanny of        the Baron's children, aren't you?We hear the bicycle stopping.        EVA (o.s.): Why?The schoolteacher has turned around and now moves towardthe girl.        SCHOOLTEACHER: They say you're from Oberdorf.        EVA: Who says that?        SCHOOLTEACHER: Folks around here.        EVA: Oh. So what?        SCHOOLTEACHER: Nothing. I don't know. Sorry. I'm        the schoolteacher here. I just thought I... I        don't know (he laughs embarrassed): when I saw        you, I thought... I'm from Grundbach... I'm the        tailor's son...        EVA: I know.        SCHOOLTEACHER (confused): What?        EVA: The Baroness already told me.        SCHOOLTEACHER: What did she tell you?                                                            15       EVA: That the schoolteacher is from the village       next to mine.       SCHOOLTEACHER (laughs): Oh, I see! Yes. Well...       I thought... (he points at the bag on the       baggage carrier): You look as if you're going       there...       EVA: Where?       SCHOOLTEACHER: Back home. To Oberdorf.       EVA (doesn't understand what he's referring to):       Yes?       SCHOOLTEACHER: Are you going there?       EVA: Yes, I am.        SCHOOLTEACHER (doesn't know what to say): Well,        I thought... since you'll cycle through our        village... you might perhaps...(he's thinking,        looks down and sees the fish): ... say hello to        my father and (laughing at his own idea, he        holds up a fish) bring him one of the fishes.        They're fresh. I just caught them.Now Eva laughs too.        EVA: What?!        SCHOOLTEACHER (smiling as if to apologize):        Well. I'm sure he'd be delighted. Especially as        it's the start of the weekend.She nods at the fish. The absurdity of the suggestionamuses her. At the same time she doesn't really know howto behave.        EVA: Well, how...The schoolteacher holds up the fish, laughs, as if hehimself doesn't how he got this idea.        SCHOOLTEACHER:    I     don't    know    either.        Unfortunately, I have nothing to wrap them in.The both laugh. Pause. Then the girl points at the bagon the baggage carrier of her bicycle and saysregretfully:        EVA: Neither have I. Unfortunately.The schoolteacher has a new "idea ":        SCHOOLTEACHER ("amused"): I could give you some        fishing line, to tie them up.        EVA (equally amused): There on the bicycle?!The schoolteacher shrugs his shoulders with a smile("why not").        EVA: I don't think that's a very good idea.                                                           16         SCHOOLTEACHER:    You're   right.   It   was   just   an         idea.        EVA: Yes.Embarrassed pause. Then        SCHOOLTEACHER: Is that your bicycle?         EVA ("What an idea!"): No! It belongs to the         estate.         SCHOOLTEACHER: I see.Pause.         SCHOOLTEACHER: Is this your first day off?         EVA (rather suspicious because all this is too         intimate for her): Yes.         SCHOOLTEACHER: Well, you're         probably   looking         forward to being at home.         EVA: Yes, I am.        SCHOOLTEACHER: I can imagine.Pause. Then        EVA says (putting the pedals and handlebar in a        "ready to leave" position): Well. I've still a        long way to go.         SCHOOLTEACHER (stepping back): Of course. Well,         good-bye.        EVA: Good-bye.She's about to ride off.        SCHOOLTEACHER (with a smile): If you cycle        through Grundbach and see my father, at least        say hello to him from me.         EVA: I don't know your father.        SCHOOLTEACHER: That's true.They look at each other for a while and then Eva ridesoff. The CAMERA FOLLOWS her. Eva and the bicycle aretottering a bit. The girl looks around and shouts,laughing:        EVA: I only learned to ride a bicycle today!         SCHOOLTEACHER (now o.s., also shouting): Well,         you're doing fine! But be careful!         As she picks up speed, Eva rides better and soon         is just a speck on the dusty country road.                                                                                                  1713. THE DOCTOR'S HOUSE INT/DUSKIt's still too early to switch on the light.Xenia and little Rudolph are sitting in the kitchen,eating. For quite a while. Suddenly        RUDOLPH: The woman today. What was wrong with        her?        XENIA (eating): Which woman? Oh, I see. She was        dead.Pause. Then        RUDOLPH: What's that?        XENIA: What?        RUDOLPH: Dead.Xenia looks up from her meal.        XENIA: What's dead? My God, that's when someone        doesn't live anymore. When he's stopped living.SILENCE. Then        RUDOLPH: When does one stop living?Xenia looks up from her meal again. Now she tries totalk more seriously to her brother because sheunderstands that these questions matter to him. Butshe's also feeling uneasy and put on.        XENIA: When you're too old or very ill.        RUDOLPH: And the woman?        XENIA: She had an accident.        RUDOLPH: An accident?        XENIA: Yes. That's when you hurt yourself very        badly.        RUDOLPH: Like Dad?        XENIA: Yes, but much worse than that. So bad,        that your body can't take it anymore.        Another SILENCE: Then        RUDOLPH: And then you're dead?        XENIA: Yes.      But   most   people   don't   have   an        accident.        RUDOLPH: That means they don't need to die?        XENIA: No, they die much later.        RUDOLPH: When?        XENIA: Later, when they're very old.Long PAUSE.                                                                   18       RUDOLPH: Do all people die?       XENIA: Yes.       RUDOLPH: All of them, really?       XENIA: Yes, everyone dies.       RUDOLPH: But not you, Xeni?       XENIA: Me too. Everyone.       RUDOLPH: But not Dad?       XENIA: Dad too.       RUDOLPH: Me too?       XENIA: You too. But not before a very very long       time. All of us, only in a very long time.       RUDOLPH: And you can't do anything against it?       It has to happen?        XENIA: It has to happen. But not now, not for a        very long time.Long PAUSE. Then        RUDOLPH: And Mom? She didn't go on a trip?PAUSE.        RUDOLPH: Is she dead too?PAUSE.        XENIA: Yes. She's dead too. But that was a long        time ago.Both remain SILENT. In the meantime it has grown dark inthe kitchen.Suddenly, Rudolph brushes away his plate off the tablewith an angry movement, and turns away from Xenia. Theplate shatters on the floor.At first Xenia is stunned, paralyzed. Then she starts tosob, but tries to hide it from her brother.                             14. RECTORY. DINING ROOM. INT/NIGHTWhile we hear the SOUNDS of the punishment and thechildren being beaten, COUNTING the strokes withincreasing MOANS and stifled WHINING, we see (CLOSEANGLES) the faces of the other brothers and sisters.Some have turned away their faces, and others start tocry with pity and fear.Finally both have received their 10 strokes.CLOSE ANGLE: The pastor. He is breathless and beads ofsweat on his forehead.        PASTOR: There.                                                           19He hands Martin the cane. CLOSE ANGLE: Martin.        Here, take the cane and put it back in its        place.As Martin is about to go, his father goes on:        But first you can thank me for trying to protect        you from any further misconduct.        CLOSE ANGLE: Marie.        You know how much I love you and how much it        hurts me to inflict such pain on you. Today was        a very sad day in my life, and I hope for all of        us that it doesn't happen again.        CLOSE ANGLE: Both kiss their father's hand.        CLOSE ANGLE: The pastor.        PASTOR (smiles): And now hug me. There's nothing        we have to forgive each other anymore. I love        you with all my heart.He first hugs Marie who, her face still wet with tears,tries a forced smile and then Martin. Then, the pastorturns to his wife:        PASTOR: Now the ribbon, Anna.Anna goes toward the two children, tying a white ribbonaround Martin's upper arm and another in Marie's hair.        PASTOR: This will remain on you until we're all        sure you have learned how to fight bad thoughts        and manners. You're well aware, this year you        will receive Christ's body in the form of bread        and wine. Until then, strive to be free of        sinful thoughts. Now let's eat.Martin carries the cane out of the room. The pastor andthe other children sit around the table. Marie leavesthe room with her mother. After all the others have satdown and put their plates back where they were beforethe punishment, the two come back with two soup bowlsand put them on the table. Martin has also come back andsits down at his place beside his father.The pastor folds his hands in prayer, the others followsuit.        PASTOR (very friendly): Marie, would you say        grace today?        MARIE (smiling eagerly): With pleasure, father.She bows her head, so do the others.        MARIE: Come Lord Jesus and be our guest        And bless what you've given to us.        PASTOR: Amen. Blessed be this meal.        THE OTHERS: Blessed be this meal.                                                           20The mother and Marie open the soup tureens and hand outthe soup. Then they eat.                               15. FARM INT/NIGHTThe body of the farmer's wife has been laid out. Thecandles to its left and right are almost burnt out.Its very quiet.Little five-year old Sepp sneaks into the room, bare-foot and wearing a shirt. He hesitates. Then, slowly andcarefully, he comes over to his dead mother. He ends upstanding beside the bed. The face of the dead woman iscovered with a white handkerchief.Sepp is very frightened. He makes several attemptsbefore he dares to lift the handkerchief. Then hewatches her, breathless, his eyes and mouth wide open.Suddenly, startled by a noise, he jerks back. He turnsaround: his 14-year old brother Paul is sitting on abench against the wall. He too only wears a shirt.        SEPP (surprised, with a whispering voice):        Pauli?!Paul doesn't say a word. Sepp doesn't know what to do.He looks at his mother again, then again at his brother.He goes over to him and sits beside him on the bench.Like birds in a cage, they remain seated in the dark.Very close together.                               16. ESTATE. THE STEWARD'S HOUSE. LIVING ROOM. BEDROOM.INT/NIGHTThe steward and his children Liesl (15), Georg andFerdinand (10)] are waiting for something. Then the dooropens and the midwife comes out. She tells them to comeinto the other room.        NARRATOR: That night, the wife of the steward        gave birth to her fourth and last child at the        age of 42.The children want to follow their father. At leastLiesl, a chubby and good-natured teenager, rather plain,can't wait to go in. But the midwife tells them to bepatient, and only the father is let through.        LIESL (burning with curiosity): What is it?       MIDWIFE (smiling): Well, what do you think?       LIESL(shakes   her   head   impatiently):   I   don't       know.       MIDWIFE: It's a boy.       FERDINAND: Oh God!                                                               21       MIDWIFE: What do you mean?! Don't you want a       brother?       FERDINAND: Pff!        MIDWIFE: You're lucky your father can't hear        you.Instead of the father, Georg hits his brother on theback of the head. They quarrel.        MIDWIFE: Stop that!She steps in and distributes a few smacks. Liesl runsout of the room howling.        MIDWIFE: You should be ashamed.        FERDINAND (Suddenly, as if he'd become another        person): Sorry.The midwife looks at him, confused.                            17. TRACK NEAR THE FARM EXT/DAWNThe farmer, Franz and Paul leave the farm, they go towork. The two oldest carry scythes.In the background vast fields of crops.The three walk hurriedly. After a while        FRANZ (hesitantly): Father, I have to tell you        something.       FARMER: What is it?        FRANZ: I went to the sawmill.The farmer keeps on walking as if he hasn't heard. Franzlooks at him from the side. For a long moment he remainssilent, while all three keep walking. Then, Franz goeson softly:        The floor, on the first level, where mother        worked, was totally rotten.They keep on walking.        The steward, who sent her there, must have known        it. And the landowner too.The farmer remains silent. They keep walking.        Father?!       FARMER (hostile): What do you want?        FRANZ (doesn't understand his father's refusal):        They sent her there knowing it was dangerous.The farmer stops, turns to Franz:        FARMER (aggressive): What are you getting at?       FRANZ (doesn't understand): But...                                                           22         FARMER (furious, but with forced calm): Do you         want me to sue the Baron? Or kill the steward?         FRANZ: I...        FARMER: Go and cut off his head of with your        scythe. Sure, that'll bring your mother back to        life.He turns away from Franz and keeps on walking. Theothers follow. After a few steps        FRANZ (softly): I think our father loved our        mother.Suddenly the farmer stops and screams, almost cryingwith fury and despair:        FARMER: Shut up!CLOSE ANGLE: Paul. He was listening carefully the wholetime. He looks at the father. Then, lowers his eyes.        NARRATOR: After these two days in July, life in        the village returned to what it had always        been...                             18. MONTAGE EXT/INS./DAY/NIGHTa) Harvesting. Even teenagers and children are used totie the sheaves and to do other easier jobs.        NARRATOR: ... The daily harvesting drove the        people almost to exhaustion. Most of the        children were busy helping their parents.b) The midwife is doing housework in the Doctor's house.A quarrel between her retarded son and the 4-year oldRudolph (that we barely can follow due to the Narrator'svoice, o.s.) is settled by the midwife in favor of herson.        For the time being, the doctor remained in the        hospital. In the meantime the midwife catered        the basic needs of Xenia and Rudolph, his two        children. After the burial of the farmer's wife,        that was attended by the whole village, the two        accidents were soon forgotten...                             19.   MANOR EXT/DAY         NARRATOR: ... until the harvest festival at the         end of the summer brought the whole village                                                           23        together again, first in a festive hustle and        bustle, and then in horror and perplexity.The courtyard is full of people, dressed in their Sundaybest:   Farmers,  seasonal-workers,   people  from   thevillage, children and teenagers.A dance hall has been set up. On it we see thelandowner, the steward and the pastor with theirfamilies.A couple of younger women, a delegation of theharvesters, goes over to present the harvest crown tothe landowner.        HARVESTER: ...with our songs and our prayers        We've gathered the rye        and given that crown to your lordship.        It is not big, it is not small,        But pretty, nice and fine.        Not with thistles or thorns is it made,        but with pure grain.        Had our lordship sowed more,        The men would've scythed more        And we girls gathered more.        We girls have gathered the grain,        Over mountains and valleys,        Over thistles and thorn,        Over the fields of our lordship.        I wish our lordship a happy life,        As many years as there's sand on the beach        As many years as there are drops in the rain        So much may our lordship be blessed.        And as a reward to be of good cheer        We'd like for our folks a barrel of beer,        And if we could have a fried goose perchance        Then we'll all be ready to dance.During the poem, the camera has shown all those we havemet until now. They have all ( except for the Doctor,the farmer and his two eldest sons) come to the feast.While all the folks present LAUGH and SHOUT, the maid,with a clumsy curtsy, hands over the harvest crown tothe Baron. The village band plays a fanfare.As soon as the hullabaloo has died down        BARON(answering): My thanks to all of you. Thank        you very much. You have worked well and the        heavens were merciful, and now the barns are        full.         Therefore there's more than enough beer, and you         won't starve today.He points to the open barn, where food and beer arewaiting. In front of the barn are tables with longbenches.         BARON: Enjoy your meal!! Eat and drink as much         as you wish. You deserve it.                                                            24Again the people YELL and CHEER. Then, the MUSIC startsand the feast is off and running.                            20. VEGETABLE GARDEN OF THE MANOR EXT/DAYThe vegetable garden is at the back of the manor house.In the distance we hear the MUSIC from the feast.Franz, in working clothes, comes over, opens a gate inthe fence, then goes to a large field with the cabbagesand slices them all off with his scythe. The whole scenelooks like a mass execution.                            21. ESTATE EXT/DAYThe party is in full swing: people dance and shout,children run around, young men quarrel and show off infront of the young girls. Older women are stand aroundin groups, gossiping. Some farmers are gathered aroundthe landowner ≠ he is friendly with them, but we don'tunderstand what they're talking about.His wife, with her nervous frailty, looks out of placein this crowd. She's talking to the schoolteacher.        BEATRIX: ...didn't you promise us a little        chorale sung by your protÈgÈs.       SCHOOLTEACHER: You have to talk to the pastor,       Baroness. We're still busy studying the choir       pieces for the confirmation feast.       BEATRIX (amused): But that's in spring, my dear.       This is the start of autumn.       SCHOOLTEACHER (smiles, embarrassed): I know, but       unfortunately not all of our little singers are       very musical. I'm sorry if...                            22. ESTATE. UNDER THE LIME TREE . EXT/DAYA quieter part of the estate.Under a big shadowy tree, we see the two strollers ofthe landowner's family, a small table and a few chairs.Eva is sitting beside the twins and watches the colorfulbustle. Sitting beside her, turning her back to themanor, is Emma, the steward's wife who is breastfeedingher baby.The steward separates from a group of men and comes overto the two women. As he comes over, he shouts to them:                                                           25        STEWARD: Well, you two "mothers"? Don't you want        to be part of the festivities?Eva looks at the steward's wife, not knowing, how toreact to the "mother joke". But the slightly naive wifeof the steward is basically fond of any jokes herhusband cracks. She turns halfway to him and says:        EMMA: It's so nice here in the shade.In the meantime the steward has come over. He's smokinga pipe.        STEWARD (in excellent mood): Well, our son seems        to be enjoying that, right?!       EMMA: Yes.       STEWARD: I can imagine. Who wouldn't like that.       EMMA (rebuking him gently): Georg!       STEWARD (to Eva): What about you? Don't you get       bored taking care of other people's children,       with all the young lads over there?        EVA (uneasy, with forced sweetness): No Sir, I        love to be with the children.He gives his wife a short glance, then sits on a chairbeside Eva:        How old are you anyway?       EVA: Eighteen, Sir.       STEWARD: Eighteen! And you want me to believe       you'd rather hold the Baroness's baby in your       arms than your true love?       EMMA (good-naturedly): Come on, Georg, leave her       alone.       STEWARD: I'm not doing her any harm. Can you get       us something to eat, Emma?       EVA (stands up, to Emma): If you mind the       children for a moment, I'll get us something.       STEWARD (stands up too): Don't worry, princess,       I'm going. Not to panic.                            23. ESTATE. THE PATH LEADING TO THE VEGETABLE GARDEN.EXT/DAYA bunch of children between 5 and 15, dressed up intheir Sunday best, among them Marie and Martin, bothwearing  their  white  ribbons,  the  pastor's  other                                                           26children, Xenia, Rudolph as well as Hans, Liesl, Georg,Ferdinand and Sigi. They leave the manor and head towardthe fields. As they pass by the vegetable garden, theynotice the sliced off cabbages and stop. Some laugh atit, others are unsettled. Most of the children keep runon out into the open fields.                            24. ESTATE. OUTSIDE THE BARN. EXT/DAYFarmhands and tenant farmers are eating at the tables.One of them tells a story, that we only partiallyunderstand because of all the noise:        FIRST TENANT FARMER: ...so the guy really tried        to steal the rooster from the steeple. He was        already completely pickled, but even then they        couldn't stop him. A huge, massive guy, you see.        So they just let him go, saying to themselves:        if he falls down, he falls down, that's it. But        he didn't get much farther than the first        window, that's where the trellis ends, see. And        even with all his strength, he couldn't hoist        himself up on the lightning rod. So the guy        stands up there in the window. And what do you        think that idiot does: he starts to crow! He        crows, shouting: I'm the rooster on the steeple.        You'll never catch me! He made such a commotion        that little by little the people in the        neighborhood started to wake up...At the same time someone else starts to shout, causingthe others to join in:       FARMHANDS and FARMERS:       More beer, more beer, or I'll fall down, hurray!       More beer, more beer, or I'll fall down.       Has the landlord hung himself,       that he doesn't serve me any beer?       More beer, more beer, or I'll fall down!Laughter. Leni, Franz's sister, and another farmgirl dotheir best to cater to the drinker's thirst as fast aspossible. The two young women try to keep their spiritsup, but the guest's indelicate jokes and rude gesturesdon't make it easy.       LENI: I'm coming. I haven't got a magic wand.       FIRST FARMHAND (with a grin): Shall I help you,       Leni? I'd love to help you.        SECOND FARMHAND (also grinning): What do you        want to help her with?!LAUGHTER.        FIRST FARMHAND: All over. Front and backside.                                                           27More LAUGHTER.        THIRD FARMHAND (to Leni): Are you as slow with        the Baron?         SECOND TENANT FARMER: Come on, leave her alone         SECOND FARMHAND: You like her that much? Go and         help her.        FOURTH FARMHAND (sitting beside the second,        almost in a whisper): Don't you know: it was her        mother who had that accident?...At the same time a boy of ten comes over to the firstfarmer and butts in to his story:        BOY: Father, they cut off the Baron's cabbages.         FIRST TENANT FARMER: What's that?        BOY (grin): They cut off the Baron's cabbages.Leni, who's just putting some glasses with beer on thetable, glares at the boy, flabbergasted.                             25.   ESTATE. DANCE FLOOR. EXT/DAYOn the dance floor, Eva and the schoolteacher try todance. Neither is very talented. Eva keeps looking ather feet and smiles, embarrassed.        EVA: I never learned it.        SCHOOLTEACHER (also with a smile): Neither did        I. You just have to count out loud. One. Two.        Three. One. Two. Three. One...Their steps are far too big. They look clumsy andembarrassed, but happy. After a few spins        EVA: Aren't you afraid your students might laugh        at you, when they see you dancing with me that        way, sir.        SCHOOLTEACHER (laughs): They'd better not! And        stop being so formal with me. I'm not that old,        am I?Eva laughs, embarrassed and looks down.        EVA: One. Two. Three. One. Two. Three. One. Two.        Three. One. Two. Three.         SCHOOLTEACHER: You see: we're getting better.         EVA: Well.         SCHOOLTEACHER: Stop looking at your feet.                                                           28She lifts her head, looks at him and... stumbles. Theylaugh and start again.                            26. VEGETABLE GARDEN EXT/DAYMUSIC of the village band can be heard coming from themanor.The Baroness reaches the vegetable garden, followed bythe pastor's wife, the tutor and some "ladies" from thevillage. Behind the fence, among the "beheaded" cabbagesare the Baron, the steward and some farmers. A couple ofcurious onlookers have gathered by the fence. Mutters,and now and then laughter.The Baron turns to his wife and, with a snicker, pointsto the "heads" lying around him.        BARON: Quite a job, isn't it?!The Baroness looks at the extent of the disaster. Thensays, revolted:        BARONESS: This is disgusting.The steward comes over to them and, with a little grin,comments on the sensitivity of his masters:        STEWARD: It used to be an old custom (he        quotes):        "Now that the harvesting's done,        "It's time to pay us, every one,        "Any miser who leaves us in a rut,        "He shall have his cabbage cut.The Baroness, who doesn't think the symbolic characterof the deed is funny at all, looks briefly at him andthen back again at the cabbage cemetery. Suddenly, sheturns away and leaves the scene headed toward the manor.She makes her way through the bystanders, who step asideto let her through.                            27. RECTORY. STUDY. INT/DUSKThe pastor works at his desk. Suddenly a KNOCK on thedoor        PASTOR (looking up): Come inFlorian comes hesitantly through the door.        PASTOR: What do you want?       FLORIAN (shy, almost frightened): I'd like to       ask you something, Father.       PASTOR: Yes?                                                           29The boy comes over to the desk, opens a few buttons ofhis shirt and then seizes something inside. In the openshirt we see the head of a little bird.        PASTOR: So what?        FLORIAN: I have found it. It's wounded.Short PAUSE.        PASTOR: What do you want?         FLORIAN (pleadingly): May I keep it?Short pause. The pastor is moved by the request of hisyoungest    son,  but   manages  to   hide   his emotionskillfully.         PASTOR: How do you plan to do that?       FLORIAN: We'll heal it.        PASTOR (softly): And when it's healed?Florian looks at him with round eyes, he doesn't knowwhat to answer. The pastor continues:        Don't you think, you'll be attached to it then?        Will you let it fly away?Florian thinks, then nods toward a cage behind the desk.        FLORIAN: "Pipsi" also lives in a cage.The pastor looks at the cage shortly, hides a smile andturns to Florian again:        PASTOR: Yes, but Pipsi grew up in captivity.        (nodding at Florian's bird): This one is used to        living in freedom.Florian doesn't know what to answer. So he merely looksat his father with pleading eyes.        PASTOR (repeats): Will you set him free, as soon        he's healed?Florian, looks down and nods with a heavy heart.        PASTOR: Have you already asked Mother?Florian nods eagerly.        PASTOR: And? What did she say?       FLORIAN: She said, it was for Father to decide.        PASTOR (smiling faintly): That's what she said?Florian nods eagerly and looks at his father with eyesthat are pleading with expectation.        PASTOR: You'll really to take care of it? That's        a heavy responsibility. You know that, don't        you?Sensing that his father is not quite against it, Floriannods eagerly.                                                           30        PASTOR: Well. You're its father and mother now.Florian nods yet more eagerly, if that's possible. Thepastor finds it difficult not to smile:        We'll have to find a cage for your patient.Florian can hardly believe it. He'd like to fling hisarms around his father's neck, but doesn't dare. So hejust keeps standing there, beaming.        FLORIAN: Thanks, Father!                            28. TRACK TO THE FARM EXT/DUSKLeni comes along the track, excited. She`s almostrunning. She reaches the farm and disappears inside.                            29. FARM. ROOM. INT/DUSKThe family is eating. They're in working clothes, sincethey didn't attend the Thanksgiving feast. Only Leni,who visibly just came into the room, is still wearingthe clothes she wore at the feast. She's out of breathand very excited. The farmer looks very concerned.        FARMER (to Franz): Is that true?       FRANZ (hostile, keeps on eating): I don't know       nothing.       FARMER (threatening): Is ≠ that - true?!       FRANZ (looks at him, aggressively): Nothing is       true! And even if it was true, so what?! Serves       him right, that miser!        FARMER (trying to control himself): Did you do        it, or did you not do it?Franz doesn't answer and keeps on eating.        LENI: It seems somebody saw you.For a moment Franz remains calm, then he bursts out:        FRANZ (to Leni): So what? They should be glad        that they still have their own heads.(to the        farmer) And I want you to know this, Father: I'm        proud of it!The father responds to this by slapping his face hard.Franz jumps up.        FARMER (orders Franz without looking at him):        Sit down!For a moment, we don't know how Franz will behave.Sitting on the corner bench, he's jammed between his                                                           31father and his brothers and sisters, who stare at thetable, embarrassed. Only Paul, who sits opposite hisbrother, looks up at him.Franz finally sits down again. SILENCE. The farmerstares at his plate, tries to speak softly, which isobviously difficult for him, to judge by the sound ofhis voice.        FARMER: What did you intend to do?As Franz doesn't answer, he looks up, right into Franz'sface, who avoids his father's eyes.        FARMER: Well?        FARMER: Tell me.Franz keeps on glaring straight ahead. The farmer adoptsa gentler tone.        Come on. Tell me:       FRANZ (who   can   hardly   speak):   You   know   why,       Father.        FARMER (after a pause): Because of your mother?        Because you feel they're responsible for her        death? Is that it? What do you think? That I'm        not man enough to settle this? It's that what        you think?Franz keeps on glaring, remaining silent. The fathertries to stay calm, staring straight ahead. He takes aspoon and eats twice from the milk soup. He puts downthe spoon, and looks at Franz again.       Did you ever think of what your behavior can       mean for the whole family? If Leni loses her       job, which enables us to keep our heads above       water for the whole year? What if we can't work       there anymore during the summer?Franz makes an impatient movement, takes raises            hisspoon and wants to go on eating. The farmer grabs          hisarm and slams it down. The two stare at each other.        Fora moment, we don't know what will happen. Then             thefarmer goes on:       You want to marry and take over the farm in two       years? Yes? And how will you feed them all (he       points with his head at the other children)       without the help of the manor, tell me?Franz turns his head away. He disagrees, but does notknow what to answer. The farmer goes on:                                                                 32        And how do you know they're responsible?Franz turns to him abruptly:        FRANZ: And how do you know they're innocent?The farmer looks at Franz with round eyes. A long PAUSEfollows. Then the        FARMER says (quietly): I don't know.And after another PAUSE.        FARMER: But I don't know the opposite either.                                30. MANOR. STAIRWELL. INT/NIGHTThe Baron stands at the bottom and shouts up at thetutor who's standing on the stairs:        BARON:...What do you mean "not there"?        TUTOR   (sheepish):   He...  disappeared.    I`ve        already looked everywhere. I can't find him.        BARON: Nonsense. He can't have vanished     into        thin air. When did you see him last?        TUTOR (as above): Around 2 o'clock.        BARON (his anger mounting): Around two? Do you        know what time it is?!        TUTOR (guiltily): I know, Sir.Furious, the landowner turns away from the nincompoop,pensive. Then he turns to the TUTOR again:        BARON: What does my wife say, doesn't she have        any clue?        TUTOR: Madame sent me to you,     Baron. She is        beside herself with fear.        BARON (wryly): I can imagine.(looks up to the        tutor): You're an idiot, Huber. Why do you think        you're here? To take care of a single child! Is        that such a hard task?        TUTOR (softly): I'm awfully sorry, Baron.        BARON: You're even too stupid for that.The Baron turns away and heads for the door. Then heturns around again and asks:                                                            33       BARON: Where did you see my son for the last       time?       TUTOR: Outside, in the courtyard. He said, he       was going to play with the other children.       BARON: Where?       TUTOR: That he didn't say.       BARON: And      my   wife   didn't   notice   anything       either?       TUTOR: After that business with the cabbage       heads, Madame retired to her room. She was       indisposed.       BARON (sarcastically): Indisposed?!       TUTOR: Yes. She had a terrible migraine attack.        BARON (almost to himself): My God, this place is        a zoo!He turns away and goes out into the courtyard. The tutorfollow him with his eyes. He feels he's being badlytreated and hates the Baron for his insults. Finally hegoes back up the stairs.                               31. MANOR. EXT/NIGHTBACK TO THE SCENE.The torches of the feast have almost burned out. Hereand there we see some lanterns, put there to facilitatethe cleaning up.Coming from the front door, the Baron crosses the vastcourtyard. Half way across he screams:        BARON: Br‰ker!!The steward is overseeing a dozen farmhands, who areputting the tables and the benches of the feast back thebarn. He walks toward the Baron.        BARON. Have you seen my son?       STEWARD (surprised): No.       BARON (quietly): Could you please ask your boys.       Apparently, Sigi has disappeared with a whole       bunch of kids.       STEWARD:    Immediately.   (shouting    to   the       farmhands): When you're finished with the       cleaning up, wait for me. There's still a job to       do. Get some fresh torches and lanterns!       BARON: In the meantime I'll go round up the men.                                                                34The steward goes to his house, the Baron         to   theoutbuildings. There, he switches on the SIREN.        NARRATOR: The steward's children said, they had        seen Sigi only for a short time, that he had        gone off with other kids, and that they didn't        pay much attention to it...                                32. MONTAGE EXT/INT/NIGHTIN THE COURTYARD.Many men of different ages with lanterns and torches.The Baron makes a short speech and the steward assignsthe areas to be searched. Most of this is drowned out bythe narrator's voice.        NARRATOR: ...The search began shortly after        midnight. Before, the Baron had ridden to the        Rectory. But there he found out nothing new from        the children who had been specially woken up.STABLE AND OUTBUILDINGS OF THE ESTATE.VARIOUS LANDSCAPES: FOREST, FIELD, RIVER MEADOWS.The search.        The searchers, who were tired and some of whom        were still drunk, were divided into two groups:        one group started to search all the buildings on        the estate, one by one, while the others combed        the surrounding areas.        It was around half past two, when some members        of the search party had already preferred to lie        down   somewhere   and   to   sleep  off   their        drunkenness, that the siren suddenly sounded        again, calling the men back to the courtyard...IN THE COURTYARD.The men come in with a stretcher.        ...They had found Sigi. He had been tied up in        the old sawmill, upside down. His trousers had        been pulled down and his buttocks were bleeding        from cane strokes. He seemed to be in a state of        shock, was unable to walk and had to be brought        back to the manor on a makeshift stretcher,        lying on his belly.                                33. CHURCH INT/DAYThe room is packed. The whole village is gathered.                                                            35        NARRATOR: The next Sunday, the Baron, at the end        of the service, asked the pastor if he could say        a few words:        BARON: You all know now what was done to my son        Siegmund. Policemen from the district town were        here this week. They questioned many of you. But        to no avail. First I thought that the people who        tortured my child were the same people who cut        off my family's "cabbage heads"...Unrest in the attendance.        ...because they wanted to "get even". Get even        for what? Because their mother had died while        she was working in the sawmill, and it was        supposedly  my  fault,   which  is  an  absurd        assertion.The farmer, Leni and the other children are there, withthe exception of Franz.The unrest grows.        At least, that's what Franz Felder gave as the        motive for his "mowing prowess", when the        policemen arrested him. I have always supported        the farmer Felder and his family, but one can't        always expect people to be grateful. That's a        matter of character.The farmer wants to leave the church.        BARON: Don't run away, Felder. It's your honor I        want to salvage.        It has turned out that the valiant Franz Felder        has been boasting of his feat in front of his        fiancÈe. Then the coward that he is, hid among        his family, and so he didn't have time to        torture my son. And there's one thing I know for        sure: the senior Felder would rather bite off        his tongue, than cover for his wayward son. May        I remind you something what most of you have        already forgotten. Almost two months ago, the        doctor had a riding accident and he has still        not returned from the hospital. This accident        was caused by a wire that had been strung in his        garden with the explicit intent of bringing him        down. And in that case too, nobody knows        anything, saw anything or heard anything.                                                           36Disconcerted MUTTER among the attendance.        We all know that the people responsible for the        terrible injuries suffered by my son, and those        suffered by the doctor are sitting here among        us, in this room. I won't tolerate that crimes        of this nature go unpunished. I don't wish        something similar to happen to any of your        children. That's why I call upon you all to help        me find the culprit or the culprits. Ask        questions, keep your ears open, be watchful. If        we fail to find out the truth, the peace within        our community will be gone. Thank you, pastor.The pastor says a few last words which we don't grasp,that the narrator's voice drowns out. The people fileout of the church, quietly and slowly, but talkingworriedly to each other.        NARRATOR: The landowner's speech frightened the        people. Most knew about the incident at the        Thanksgiving feast. But the majority didn't know        exactly what had happened, and in the end they        didn't care. The Baron was not really popular        among the people, but he was respected as a        powerful social figure, as well as the employer        of nearly the whole village.                                34. IN FRONT OF THE CHURCH EXT/DAYBACK TO THE SCENE.The people are leaving the church, groups are forming.As the farmer Felder and his children come out, they'reshunned.Gauntlet down the village street. The CAMERA follows.         NARRATOR: ...His threat about loosing the peace         of the community couldn't mean anything good.        At the same time the mysterious character of        what were obviously criminal deeds fed the        mistrust of the farmers, deeply rooted since        time immemorial.                            35. SCHOOL. INT/NIGHTThe empty classroom. On the harmonium: a petroleum lamp.The schoolteacher is PLAYING.After a while, someone knocks at the door. Theschoolteacher stops.        SCHOOLTEACHER (surprised): Come in!                                                           37The door opens hesitantly. In the dark: Eva (hardlyrecognizable because she's so far from the lamp).        SCHOOLTEACHER (surprised and glad): Eva!        EVA (hardly understandable): May I come in?The Schoolteacher stands up, goes toward and, laughingwith surprise, says to her.        SCHOOLTEACHER: What a question. Of course. Come        in. What happened.Eva enters the room and closes the door behind her.She's carrying a suitcase. Shyly she looks around anddoesn't say a word.        SCHOOLTEACHER:   Come   over   here.   It's   so   dark.        Come on.He moves toward the lamp and waits half-way because shedoesn't follow.        SCHOOLTEACHER: What's going on?        EVA: They fired me.        SCHOOLTEACHER (startled): What do you mean?She shrugs her shoulders.        EVA: Nothing. They just threw me out (pause,        then) The tutor has also been fired.Suddenly, in the middle of a sentence, she bursts intofloods of tears. At the same time she turns away fromthe schoolteacher. He goes over to her, and stops infront of her, but is too shy to touch her. Suddenly sheturns to him again and says, sobbing:        I don't know where to go. I can't go back home        in the middle of the night. I'm afraid to walk        on the road all alone.        SCHOOLTEACHER (calming her down): Don't worry.        Try to calm down. There's nothing to worry        about.                                                                   38        EVA (sobbing, childish): There is.        SCHOOLTEACHER (with a calming smile): Come here        and sit down. Please calm down and then tell me        what happened. All right?She's sits down on the school bench beside her. Theschoolteacher sits on his haunches in front of her:        Well?!It takes her time to calm down.        What happened?Slowly she manages to calm down, breathes deeply a fewtimes. The schoolteacher is visibly charmed by herchildish despair.        EVA: The son of the Baron isn't at all well. His        parents are angry and desperate. Now they say        that it's the tutor's and my fault, because we        didn't pay enough attention to him. But I'm only        there for the twins.She starts to sob again:        I've always taken care of them very well. When        you and I were dancing, the Baroness had given        me permission. I haven't done anything wrong,        really.        SCHOOLTEACHER: I know, come on. Stop crying!        EVA: Where shall I go now? We need the money I        was earning here.        SCHOOLTEACHER:   You'll  find   something  else.        Besides, you know very well that the Baron is        quick-tempered. With him, nothing is ever as bad        as it seems.        EVA (fiercely shaking her head):No, no, that's        all over now, I know it. The Baroness doesn't        want to see anyone. She wants to take the        children with her to town or to her parent's        estate ≠ I don't know exactly.                                                           39        SCHOOLTEACHER: (after a pause): I'll try to talk        to her. A while back, we played music together.        (with a smile): Unfortunately, I wasn't very        good. Now she's got the tutor, he plays better.        As far as I know, he's been studying music in        town.        EVA (forgetting her grief a bit): He doesn't        play that well.        SCHOOLTEACHER: That's true.        EVA (after a pause, serious again): Who could        have done such things?        SCHOOLTEACHER: What?        EVA: To beat a child that way.        SCHOOLTEACHER: I don't know.Long PAUSE. Then she says softly:        EVA: Can I stay here tonight?         Don't send me        away, sir, please.        SCHOOLTEACHER: How can you think something like        that?        EVA: I'll just wait for the daylight to come.        Here in the classroom. Then I'll leave.Suddenly she starts to cry again:        They won't understand this,      at   home.   They'll        think I did something wrong.PAUSE. Then the        SCHOOLTEACHER: Do you want me to come with you.She stops crying and looks at him, surprised.                                                                40        EVA: What did you say?        SCHOOLTEACHER    (cheerful):   Tomorrow,   after        school? I can try to find us a carriage. I'll be        back by evening.        EVA: And why should you do that, Sir.        SCHOOLTEACHER: Stop being so formal.        EVA (after a break): Why should you do this?PAUSE. Then the schoolteacher stands up and says:        SCHOOLTEACHER: Come here, I'll play something        for you. If you'd like that.She thinks for a moment, then she nods eagerly. Shefollows him, as he goes and settles in front of theharmonium. She sits on a bench nearby. He starts toPLAY.                                      36. FARM. PIGSTY. INT/EXT/DAYThe farmer and Paul are cleaning the pigsty which is notvery big. The pigs grunt excitedly because of thedisturbance.Suddenly, Franz enters.         FRANZ: Good morning, Father.The farmer looks up, keeps on working as if nobody hadcome in.Paul greets Franz with a nod, remaining silent.After a while, they've done their work. Ignoring Franz,the farmer goes outside.Franz, who has stepped aside to let his father by, saysto him as he goes out:         FRANZ: I'm back again. They set me free.At this, the farmer stops and turns around. He looksFranz right into the eyes:         FARMER: I can see that. So what?Franz bows his head. Paul, who has followed his father,out of the pigsty, glances surreptitiously at hisbrother. The farmer goes over to the fountain and washeshimself. Franz follows him slowly and stops beside hisfather, who keeps ignoring him. After a while                                                           41        FRANZ says (softly): Can't you forgive me,        Father?The farmer stops washing and turns to Franz:        FARMER: What do you want me to forgive for? That        the estate won't give me any work now? That Leni        has been fired in disgrace? That your brothers        and sisters soon won't have anything to eat. Is        that what you mean? Or is it something else?                            37. COUNTRY ROAD AND DOCTOR'S PROPERTY EXT/DAYThe CAMERA follows the carriage in which are Eva and theschoolteacher.        NARRATOR: The next day, after school, I went to        the estate to inquire about Sigi's health and to        intercede for Eva's reinstatement. We were told        the Baroness had left that morning with her        children. Reluctantly, the steward lent me a        carriage to take Eva home.An open carriage with the Doctor inside comes from theopposite direction. The passengers of the two carriagesgreet each other. The CAMERA follows the Doctor andlooses Eva and the schoolteacher.The doctor has one arm in a sling.The Doctor's carriage ends up turning into his property.The driver helps the doctor get out. Xenia comes runningout of the house and greets her father. The driverunloads the luggage. The doctor and Xenia go into thehouse.       Just as we were leaving the village, we met the       doctor.       A few days after the Thanksgiving feast,       Rudolph, his four year old son, had suddenly       disappeared. Of course, everybody was terribly       upset in view of all the previous occurrences.       Finally, he was found walking down the road,       scantily dressed for a trip, headed eagerly       toward the town. When he was asked where he was       going, he said he wanted to visit his father.       Seems he fought tooth and nail against being       taken home.       Somebody must have told this to the Doctor.       Since he was scheduled to be released from       medical care anyway, he had prematurely put an       end to his stay at the hospital.                                                                                       4238. THE DOCTOR'S HOUSE INT/DAYBACK TO THE SCENE.STAIRWELL.        DOCTOR (calls several times): Rudi?He throws an ironical inquiring look at Xenia. Xeniashrugs her shoulders, clueless:        XENIA: He was in the living room a short time        ago.Just as they're about to go to the living room, thedriver comes in with the luggage. The Doctor thanks himand pays him. The driver leaves. Xenia has been waitingin the doorway. Now they go together into theLIVING ROOMThere's nobody. They go into the kitchenKITCHEN. Nobody. The look under the kitchen table, inthe pantry. Nobody.         DOCTOR: Rudi? Where are you?Again theSTAIRWELL. The doctor doesn't know whether to be angryor to laugh about the whole matter. He goes to hiswardrobe to take his off his jacket. Because of thesling, Xenia has to help him. That's when she noticesthe toilet. She tells her father with a smile. As Xeniahangs up the doctor's jacket, he goes to the toilet doorand tries to open it. It's locked. The Doctor stops infront of it.         DOCTOR (quiet): Hello, Rudi. Don't you want to         say hello to your father? No?PAUSE:         I heard you even wanted to visit me at the         hospital. And now you lock yourself in?PAUSE. The doctor looks shortly at Xenia who's carryingthe luggage upstairs. Then he keeps on talking toRudolph:         All right. Then, I don't want to see you either.         I'm going away now. You can stay in the toilet,         if you want.He goes down the few steps to the entrance, waits amoment and then leaves the house.                                39. PROPERTY THE DOCTOR'S EXT/DAYBACK TO THE scene.                                                            43The doctor steps out of the door, and wanders throughthe garden. He goes over to the trees, where the wirehad been strung. He examines the traces of the wire onthe bark. He lights a cigar, then looks out at the mowedfields.After a while Xenia comes over to him. He glances ather, then again at the fields. Both remain silent. Aftera while        XENIA   says:  Everything  is   ready  in   your        practice.   Mrs.   Wagner  prepared   everything        yesterday.PAUSE then        DOCTOR: Why do you tell me that?Xenia looks at him, surprised, shrugs her shoulders.        XENIA: I don't know. I just thought you might        want to know.PAUSE.        DOCTOR: Has she taken good care of you?        XENIA: Yes.PAUSE. The doctor turns to Xenia:        DOCTOR: How old are you now?        XENIA: Fourteen.The doctor looks at her, laughs silently and shakes hishead. Again he looks out on the fields. After a while hesays:        DOCTOR: It's amazing how much you look like your        mother.Xenia remains silent. Suddenly she whispers:        XENIA: Dad.The doctor turns to her. She nods toward the house. Thedoctor follows her look. Indeed Rudolph, who from herelooks even smaller than he really is, has steppedgingerly out of the door. Unsure and undecided, tornbetween defiance and longing, he's kept one hand on thedoor handle that he can barely reach.                            40. RECTORY. STUDY. INT/NIGHTThe pastor cleans the cage of the small bird behind thedesk and feeds the animal. As he does it, he talks to                                                           44Martin, who, the white ribbon still tied around hisupper arm, stands in front of the desk.        PASTOR: Your mother and I are deeply worried        about you. Think about it. Are you sleeping        badly? Are you overtired?       MARTIN   (as   if   he   didn't   understand   the       question): No.       PASTOR: Do you have problems in school that I       don't know?        MARTIN (as above): No, Father.The pastor turns shortly around to his son, looks athim, then turns again to the bird.       PASTOR: You probably don't understand why we       worry. It comes from a sad experience I want to       tell you briefly about:       As you know, I'm also acting as pastor for the       communities of Birkenbrunn and Hebern. In the       latter place, some years ago, a mother came to       see me. She had noticed that her son, who was       about the same age as you, and had the same       symptoms that you've been showing for some time.       Although until then the boy had been healthy and       active,   suddenly   he  showed   a   noticeable       weariness, he had dark rings under the eyes,       seemed depressed and joyless. The boy had also       changed emotionally: before he had been funny,       frank, almost naughty, but now he became       withdrawn. He tried not to look his parents in       the eye, and was caught telling small and even       big lies.The pastor has finished the cleaning and feeding, andnow sits down behind his desk, Martin opposite him:        That lasted approximately half a year. Then        everything went very fast: he lost his appetite,        couldn't sleep any more, his whole face took on        the brownish color of the rings under his eyes,        his hands began to shake, his memory stated to        fail him, he was covered with numerous small        pustules, first on his face, then on his whole        body and finally he died. The body, which I        blessed, looked like the body of an old man.The pastor watches Martin:        PASTOR: Do you understand now why I'm worried?Martin reacts with a timid nod of his head.        PASTOR: So, according to you: what caused these        changes that led to the miserable end of this        boy?       MARTIN (hardly able to speak): I don't know.                                                            45        PASTOR: I think you know well.Martin doesn't know what to say, he looks down. Thepastor watches him for a long moment, then he gets up,walks around the desk and sits down on its edge, infront of the boy, so that their heads are facing eachother.        Won't you tell me? No?        Then I'll tell you what the cause was: The boy        had learned from someone, who had harmed the        finest nerves of his body, in the area where        God's will has erected sacred barriers. The boy        imitated this action. He couldn't stop doing it,        so that at the end he destroyed all the nerves        in his body, and so much that he died of it.Martin seems very affected. He has bowed his head,swallows several times, and hardly dares to breath.        Look at me, Martin.Martin looks up fearfully, then immediately looks awayagain.        I just want to help you. I love you with all my        heart. Look at me.Martin looks his father in the eyes.        Be sincere, Martin. Why did you blush and become        so nervous when I told you the story of the poor        boy.        MARTIN: Blushed? I don't know... I felt sorry        for him.        PASTOR: Is that all?        No, Martin, there has to be another reason. It's        written on your face.        Be sincere, Martin. Sincerity brings you closer        to God, our beloved Father, and to all human        beings.        MARTIN (starts to cry): Oh, my God!He cries in a such pitiful way that even the pastor hastears in his eyes. He embraces the boy. The latterseizes the hand of his father and kisses it intensely.        PASTOR: Well, Martin, why are you crying? Shall        I spare you that confession? You too have done        what that wretched boy did, haven't you?        MARTIN (crying): Oh my God! Yes.THE SCREEN GOES BLACK.                                                                                       4641. THE MIDWIFE'S HOUSE. LIVING ROOM. INT/NIGHTIntercourse between the midwife and the doctor. Sheholds on to the sideboard, as he penetrates her frombehind. Both are fully dressed, she has just lifted herskirt.When he is ready, she turns around and puts her armsaround him. He lets her do it, with a patronizing smileand pulls gently away from her.        DOCTOR: Careful, my arm.She tries to hide her frustration, sits down again withhim at the table, on which are the leftovers of theirmeal. With a little ironic smile, the doctor raises hisglass to her. She takes her glass and clinks it withhis. She drinks. An embarrassed silence follows.Finally, she says        MIDWIFE: It's great that you're back. It was        about time.         DOCTOR: You can say that. Yes.PAUSE.         MIDWIFE: It was   difficult    with    the    children,         without you.         DOCTOR: I know.         MIDWIFE: He doesn't like me.         DOCTOR: Who?         MIDWIFE: Rudi.         DOCTOR (after a pause): He's at a difficult age.        MIDWIFE: Actually not.PAUSE. Then:        They're always at a difficult age.        DOCTOR (more to himself, with a faint smile):        Yes.LONG PAUSE.        MIDWIFE: You didn't miss me.         DOCTOR: Come on. What are you saying?!         MIDWIFE: Nothing. I said it because it's the         truth.PAUSE.         DOCTOR: There's   nothing   like   a   nice    dose   of         self-hate.         MIDWIFE: What?         DOCTOR: Nothing. Forget it.                                                                    47After a pause, she reaches over the table, takes hishand, puts her cheek against it. He lets her do it, thentakes his hand from under her head and strokes her hair.                            42. CHURCH EXT/DAYIt's snowing. From the inside of the church, we hear thechildren's choir:CHILDREN (singing in harmony):        ...us free from all misery,        That has hit us now.        That old evil enemy,        Is serious about it,        Great power and much deceit        Are his cruel armor,        No one on earth resembles him...*Over this:        NARRATOR: Winter came early that year. At the        Reformation feast on the first Sunday of        November, a deep blanket of snow covered the        village.        The Baron, who had come back without his family,        didn't attend, which was very unusual for him...                            43. CHURCH INT/DAYIMMEDIATE BACK TO THE scene.The community celebrates the Reformation Feast.The schoolteacher conducts the children's choir. Thechildren sing enthusiastically. Marie and Martin wearthe white ribbon on their arm.        NARRATOR: ...The villagers took that as a sign        of his anger. Indeed, no evidence had been found        as to the possible author of the crime, although        the Baron's appeal had led to a flood of mutual        suspicions,   even    to   some    attempts   of        denunciation that had all turned out to be        untenable.                                                                                           4844. THE STEWARD'S HOUSE. INT/NIGHTThe doctor examines the steward's baby that is crying.Finally, he turns to the parents.        DOCTOR: Well, it's not pneumonia. But you must        be careful. If his temperature rises, call me        again. For the time being you must give these        drops every two hours. And hang some wet sheets        over the oven. That facilitates breathing.While the mother puts the child back in the cradle, thedoctor and the father go down the STAIRWAY to the LIVINGROOM.        How long has the window been open?       STEWARD: Difficult to say. My wife nursed him at       about one o'clock. When she came back, it was       around half past two. At that time it was icy       cold in this room.       DOCTOR: And the baby didn't cry?        STEWARD: No. The children were upstairs and        didn't hear anything either.They have reached the living room where Liesl, Georg andFerdinand get up as he comes in.        DOCTOR (to the children): He's doing all right,        considering the circumstances. We have to wait.The children seem worried. To calm them the doctor adds:        For now we'll have to wait.The steward has gone to the sideboard.        STEWARD: Can I offer you something to warm you        up?       DOCTOR: No, thanks. I'm overloaded with work.       When one has been away for so long...        STEWARD: Georg!At a sign of the father, Georg jumps up and gets thedoctor's coat and hat from outside. In the meantime, thefather keeps on chatting with the doctor:        And how is your arm doing?       DOCTOR: It's all right. Everything will be fine       in two or three weeks.        STEWARD: That must be terrible, I imagine. You        probably feel like half a man when you can't use        your arm properly.Georg has come back with the hat and the coat, and handsthem to the doctor,        DOCTOR: Thank you.The steward helps him with his coat because of his badarm.                                                           49         DOCTOR (laughs): Quod erat demonstrandum. Thank         you. Well, good night, children.         CHILDREN: Good night, Doctor.        DOCTOR (to the steward who holds the door open):        Thank you. If your wife thinks that the baby...The steward closes the door to the stairwell, so that wecan't grasp the rest of their conversation.The children are alone. They remain silent. Then        FERDINAND: Well...         GEORG: What do you mean "well"?         FERDINAND ("dumb question,      it's   obvious"):   I         mean! That's fine.PAUSE.         LIESL (to Ferdinand): When did you go down to         see Father? Down in his office.         FERDINAND: Why?         LIESL: Just asking.                              45. SNOW-COVERED COUNTRY ROAD EXT/DAYThe schoolteacher, a rucksack on his back, walks throughthe snow which is only furrowed by some carriage tracks.         NARRATOR: In mid-December, I finally got a         letter from Eva. Her father had found her a new         job in the district capital, which she would         start at the beginning of the New Year.         Since that night, where she had come looking for         shelter in the school and we had tried to tell         each other the story of our short lives until         the wee hours of the morning, I could no longer         banish from my thoughts her pale face, her shy         but frank personality and her shining hair red.         The school holidays lasted until the morning         after New Year's Day, but already the second day         after Christmas ≠ the weather was cold but sunny         ≠ I went on my way to Obersdorf in order to         visit Eva and her parents.                                                                                               5046. THE HORSE-TRADER'S LIVING-ROOM INT/DAYA lower middle-class room.The schoolteacher sits in front of Eva and her siblings,6 children between 14 and 6, mostly red-haired like Eva.Embarrassed silence. The younger children whisper andgiggle. The conversation is slow. After a long pause        EVA says: And Sigi?        SCHOOLTEACHER: I don't know. The Baroness isn't        back yet.        EVA: And the Baron?        SCHOOLTEACHER (shrugs): We hardly see him. He        talks to nobody. I don't know. Some say they've        gone to the south. To Italy.        EVA: To Italy? Really.PAUSE.   The   children    giggle,   amused   over    theembarrassment of the two people.The schoolteacher and Eva look at each other, but Evasoon averts her eyes.        SCHOOLTEACHER: They now want to tear down the        sawmill for good. That's what the steward says.        Because it isn't worthwhile to...At that moment the door opens and Eva's parents come in.Obviously, the mother went to fetch the father. She isplump, in her late forties and only wears a woolen shawlover her shoulders. The father wears a hat and overcoat.He's a sturdy man in his early fifties, of peasantstock. He probably came straight from a tavern, andappears to be slightly drunk. The schoolteacher, Eva andthe children stand up. The schoolteacher bows deeply:        SCHOOLTEACHER: Good morning.        FATHER: Good morning, young man.They shake hands.        FATHER: Please be seated. We're not very formal        here.With a short movement of his hand the father invites himto sit down.        FATHER (to the children): Scram!The children, rather sheepish since the arrival of theirfather, leave the room. The father unbuttons his overcoat, throws the hat on the sofa and sits down. Themother has removed her shawl and asks the schoolteacher:        MOTHER: Would you like something to drink?        SCHOOLTEACHER: No, thank you. Very kind.        MOTHER: Really?        SCHOOLTEACHER: Really. Thank you very much.                                                            51The father sits      down beside Eva and looks at theschoolteacher. Eva    appears to be awkward, and stares atthe table in front   of her.        FATHER: So   you're a schoolteacher.         SCHOOLTEACHER: Yes.        FATHER: Can you afford to have a wife?Short embarrassed PAUSE.        SCHOOLTEACHER: My father works as a tailor in        Grundbach. I have an apprentice's diploma. So I        earn quite a bit on the side         FATHER: You should have taken over your father's         business, that would have been smarter.PAUSE.         Well. And why are you so focused on that girl?         She's almost still a child. You could almost be         her father.         SCHOOLTEACHER (smiles): I'm thirty-one.         FATHER (grinning): Well, you can still handle         what matters.        MOTHER (embarrassed): Father!Eva and the schoolteacher don't know where to look.        FATHER: Let's be serious: do you know whether        she's willing to get married. She's still a        child. She hasn't seen anything of the world.        To Eva: Say something. Do you want him?Eva wishes the earth would engulf her.        FATHER: Come on. Don't make such a fuss. He        walked all the way over through the fresh snow.         MOTHER: Why don't you leave her alone.         Of         course, she wants him. Can't you feel that?!        FATHER: How can I? If she keeps her mouth shut!Eva jumps up and runs out, so as not to burst into tearsout of shame.The mother follows her, shaking her head disapprovinglyat the father. The schoolteacher stands up, as Eva ranout. He'd rather follow her, but has to remain politetoward the father. The father says calmly:         FATHER: Just sit down. That's how women are. A         bit hysterical, the whole lot of them. Listen.         I'm not a big talker. On one hand, it suits me         for the girl to leave the house. We have a lot         of mouths to feed, as you can see.                                                             52         On the other hand, it's all moving a bit too         fast for me. I don't know you. It's not that I         don't like you, but I need to get some         information about you first. Besides, the town         hairdresser has agreed to take her on as an         apprentice.         That way she'll get to meet people and she can         make up he mind whether she really wants this or         not. And if in a year's time she has stuck to         this idea, we can l talk about it again. And you         can make up your mind too, all right?         SCHOOLTEACHER: I actually thought I...         FATHER (interrupts him): I know, I know. But         it's either that or nothing. You get it?         SCHOOLTEACHER (after a short pause) steps back:         If you insist...        FATHER: Yes, I do.He holds out his hand to the schoolteacher, who acceptsit after a brief hesitation.        FATHER: That's it. I'm pleased. Well, business        is waiting. Even on holidays. I'll send the girl        back in so that you can say good-bye. A year        goes by fast. The world won't collapse. And        during your holidays you can come and visit her.        Good-bye.He leaves the room. The schoolteacher is thrown offbalance by all this. He stands up and takes a few steps.He sits down again and thinks.Finally, the door opens and Eva enters. She doesn'treally know what to do. Neither does the schoolteacher.As she comes in he stands up again. Finally Eva goesover to the table and sits down. The schoolteacher alsosits down. They exchange a short glance and an equallybrief smile.PAUSE.        SCHOOLTEACHER says: Did your father tell...?         EVA: Yes.PAUSE.         SCHOOLTEACHER: Is that all right with you?PAUSE.         EVA: Is that all right with you, sir?        SCHOOLTEACHER (smiles): Don't be so formal with        me.Eva looks up. Their eyes meet. Then she takes his handin her hand. They remain seated without saying a word.                                                                                         5347. RECTORY. THE BOYS' BEDROOM. INT/NIGHTIt is dark. Martin, Anton and Florian, whom we don'trecognize at first glance, are lying in their beds.Through the window, a red glow, slowly getting stronger.Suddenly         MARTIN'S VOICE: Toni! Are you awake?       Toni!!       ANTON'S VOICE (half asleep): What is it?       MARTIN VOICE: Look.       ANTON'S VOICE: What's happening?        MARTIN VOICE: Look! Look what's happening out        there!!Now, Anton sits up slowly, rubs his eyes.        ANTON'S VOICE: My God, what do you want?        MARTIN VOICE: Over there!! Have a look out of        the window!!Anton turns to the window and looks at the red glow.Then he slips out of the bed and goes to the window.Suddenly, he is wide-awake:        ANTON: Something is burning! Over there at the        estate!         MARTIN: Untie me!Anton turns around to Martin, hesitates.         MARTIN: Come on, untie me!Anton doesn't really know what to do. He turns to thewindow again, then again to Martin. The latter screamsangrily:         I told you to untie me!!       ANTON: I don't know...        MARTIN: I'll beat you black and blue, if you        don't untie me!The loud dispute has now also awakened Florian, who saysin a drowsy voice:        FLORIAN: What's happening? Why can't you be        quiet.       MARTIN: Flori, come over and untie me!       FLORIAN: What's going on?       MARTIN (yells): Untie me, dammit!! You idiots!       It's burning!!                                                           54        FLORIAN: It's burning?Florian gets up himself and patters to the window. Helooks out and then says, amazed and enthusiastic:        It's burning!        MARTIN (imitates him angrily): OK, it's burning!        Now untie me, godammit!Florian looks at Anton with questioning eyes and thensays to Martin:        FLORIAN: But Father hasn't allowed it...Reverse angle POV of the two boys at the window towardMartin, who we see for the first from the front. Hiswrists are tied to the left and the right side of thebed. Trying sit up, he pulls furiously at his ties.        MARTIN (furious): But if there's an emergency,        you idiot. Somebody must warn them! (he yells        loudly: Faaaather!! Mooooother!! Father!Frightened by his screams, Anton now goes over to himand undoes his ties.        ANTON: Stop shouting. I'll untie you.        FLORIAN: Shall I call Mother?We already hear hurried STEPS in the corridor. The dooropens and the mother enters, dressed in a nightgown.        MOTHER: What's going on here?Martin has just been untied.        MARTIN: It's burning!        MOTHER: I know. Your father has already gone.In the door, the girls appear after their mother. Theyhave left their room attracted by the noise. The motherturns to them:        MOTHER: What are you doing here? (to everyone):        You all go to bed now. It's nothing. There's a        fire on the estate. You don't need to be afraid.        Go to bed and sleep. Come on, Marie, take your        sisters with you and go to your room. Otherwise        you'll catch a cold.The girls disappear again. The mother turns to Martin:        Why did you make so much noise? You woke us all        up!Martin doesn't know what to answer. Then he saysapologetically:        MARTIN: I thought it was dangerous.       ANTON (apologizing): I had to untie his hands.       MOTHER (calming them down): Now, everything's       all right again. Tomorrow, Father will tell you       what happened with the fire. All right? Now you                                                           55        all got back to bed. I'll wait till you're back        in bed. It's freezing cold outside.The three boys go back to bed. But first Anton ties upMartin's hands again. He pulls a blanket over hisbrother. Then they all disappear under their blankets.       MOTHER: Good night then. Sleep well.        MARTIN, ANTON, FLORIAN: Good night, Mom!The mother closes the door. Coming from outside, we cansee the glow of the fire.                              48. ESTATE EXT/NIGHTESTABLISHING SHOT.A big barn is blazing   fiercely. SOUNDS of the FIRE.Against it we see,       as silhouettes, the Baron, thesteward and his wife,   the pastor, and all those, who arevainly trying to save   thing.                              49. THE STEWARD'S HOUSE INT/NIGHTIn the children's bedroom, lit by the reflection fromthe nearby flames: Liesl, Georg and Ferdinand. Theystand at the window and stare into the flames.                              50. FARM BUILDINGS /EXT/DAYPaul discovers his dead father in the pigsty. The farmerhas hung himself up from a hook in the wall. Theknocked-over stool still lies beneath his dangling feet.Paul runs from the stable out to thecourtyard. He stops.Then he tiptoes toward the stable door. As he touchesthe stable door, he lacks the strength to go insideagain. Slowly he heads for the living room. Thechildren, who are gathered, pay no attention to him.Leni, who's cooking, has looked up from her workbriefly. Paul sits down on the bench against the wall.It is quite dark in there.                              51. THE DOCTOR'S HOUSE. OFFICE. INT/DAYThe doctor sits at his desk, the midwife sits on thevisitor's chair opposite him. She tries to masturbatehim.                                                             56This time, too, both are fully dressed. Over hisclothes, the doctor wears an unbuttoned white coat.He watches the woman for a while in her activity, thenhe says coldly:        DOCTOR: Wouldn't it be better if you stopped        doing that?It's like a slap in the face. She looks dumbfounded.       DOCTOR: Why all the effort? Don't look at me so       dumbfounded.       It's not that you lack talent... It's just that       I can't do it with you any more, that's all.       To tell you the truth: you disgust me.He gets up and buttons up his pants. She feels as if theworld had collapsed around her.        Please finish your work now? I don't want to        spend all night here.The midwife remains seated, her head bowed, as if struckby a lightning        MIDWIFE (quietly): What did I do to you?        DOCTOR (irritated): My God, you haven't done        anything at all. You're ugly, you're messy,        you're flabby and you have bad breath. Isn't        that enough?PAUSE. He points at the examination couch on the otherside of the small room, saying casually:        The upholstery has to be sterilized with boiling        waterShe remains immobile, and shoots a quick mechanicalglance at the examination couch. He looks at her.        Stop sitting there as if you were carrying all        the world's woes on your shoulders. The world        won't collapse down. Not on you, or on me.       (explains):I just want it to stop, that's all.       I've been trying, but it's just disgusting. I       try to think of another woman when I'm making       love to you, a woman who smells good, who's       young one, one who's less flabby than you, but       my imagination can't handle it. In the end, it's       you again and then I just feel like throwing up       and am embarrassed at myself. So what's the       point?!       MIDWIFE: Are you through?        DOCTOR:(contemptuously)): Yes, I have been for        ages.He turns away. The midwife hardly moves. She's stillsitting on the visitor's chair. It takes her a lot of                                                           57strength not to faint ≠ at the same time she speaks outcalmly.         MIDWIFE: You must be very unhappy to be so mean.         DOCTOR: Oh God! Please, not that routine!         MIDWIFE: I know that I'm not much to look at. My         bad breath comes from my stomach, you know that         very well. But it didn't bother you in the past         when we got together. I already had my ulcer         when your wife was still alive.         DOCTOR: Please spare me these sordid details.         But let me reassure you: it has always disgusted         me. I accepted it, because I wanted to ease my         pain after Erika's death and I didn't care with         whom. I could have screwed a cow. Whores are         unfortunately too far from here and regrettably         once every two months isn't enough for me, even         though I'm getting older. So skip your damn         martyrdom routine and get out.PAUSE.         MIDWIFE (keeps on speaking softly): Why did this         only occur to you now?         DOCTOR: According to you: when should it have         occurred to me?         At the hospital, I had forgotten how tiresome         you were. One grows sentimental when one's in         pain.PAUSE.         DOCTOR (tired): Get out. Why don't you get out.         Don't you have any pride?         MIDWIFE (equally tired): There's no room for any         with you.         DOCTOR: That's true.         MIDWIFE: Aren't    you   afraid   that   I   might   do         something silly?         DOCTOR (laughs with disdain): Go ahead. At least         that would surprise me. But be careful: it might         be painful.         MIDWIFE: I know. I'm ridiculous. You wouldn't         care anyway.        DOCTOR: Well...She looks at him.                                                                   58        MIDWIFE: Why do you despise me? For helping to        raise the boy? For watching you fingering your        little daughter and not saying a word?The doctor goes over and slaps her. Tears start to rundown her face, but after a short pause she keeps onspeaking, "unmoved":        For helping you to deceive yourself? For        listening to you claim how unique your love for        Erika was, though the whole village knew, how        badly you treated her?        For loving you, although I know you can't stand        being loved?The doctor snorts with disdain.        DOCTOR: That's it. Now leave me alone. I've got        work to do.She gets up and makes room for him. He sits down at thedesk and "works". She looks down at him:        MIDWIFE: You can't afford to get rid of me. Who        would do the dirty work for you, who would help        you with the children, and here in you practice?        You're not speaking seriously. You just want to        see how far you can go, don't you: will she        still put up with it or can I drag her even        lower through the mud?PAUSE. The doctor "works", as if he hadn't heard. Shekeeps watching him for a while, and then says softly:        I'm tired too. I've got two retarded children:        Hans and you. You're the one that gives me most        trouble.He looks up at her. After a pause, he says:        DOCTOR: My God, why don't you just die?!                                52. FARM. EXT/DAYRays of cold winter sun.The men carry the coffin out of the house. Some peopleare already waiting outside. All wear mourning clothes.The coffin is shouldered, the funeral procession forms,with the pallbearers and in the lead. The others who hadgathered in the house follow. Paul comes out with Sepp,whom he tries to calm. Finally Leni comes out and, in                                                           59words that we can't hear, asks the old midwife to lookafter the farm for a short while. She gathers hersisters and with them gets in the funeral processionright behind the coffin.The procession starts to move off. As it comes aroundthe corner of the farm to go down the path leading tothe village, Franz comes toward them. Muttering is heardfrom the villagers. They don't know how to react. Theprocession slows down. Franz comes over. For a while hestands in front of the coffin, head bowed. Then he joinshis brothers and sisters. He and Leni exchange a glance,then he takes his place beside her. After he hasmotioned to the coffin bearers, the procession starts tomove off again slowly, despite of the continuedmuttering. Paul, who is still carrying Sepp, looksexpectantly toward his older brother who squeezes hishand. Paul smiles shyly. Then Franz takes over littleSepp, in the most natural way. For a long moment italmost looks as if, despite of all the gloom, thesepeople weren't desperate.                             53. VILLAGE AND SURROUNDING LANDSCAPE EXT/DAYVarious long shots of the snow-covered landscape.        NARRATOR: The year was coming to an end with        fine weather. The sun made the snowy landscape        sparkle so brightly that it hurt the eyes.        None of us suspected that it would be the last        time a year moved on to the next in an era of        peace, and that that same year a radical change        would take place of which no one had the        faintest inkling...                                54. RECTORY. LIVING ROOM. INT/DAYThe decorated Christmas tree. Outside bright sunlight.The pastor is taking the white ribbon off Marie's headand Martin's arm. The rest of the family witnesses thisalmost solemn act.        NARRATOR: ...Despite of the strange events, that        had unsettled the village, we thought of        ourselves as united in the belief that the life        in our community was God's will and worth        living.        PASTOR: ... I take of this ribbon from you, in        the belief that from now on you'll no longer        need it.        You, Marie, will be accepted this year as a full        member of the church community. You will receive                                                           60        Christ's body as bread and as wine. May the time        of preparation for the confirmation feast be one        of happiness and enrichment.        And you, Martin: from now on you shall not only        be free of that ribbon, but also from those        nightly ties that were intended to save you from        yielding to the temptations of your young body.        For in a house full of festive expectation, you        too, on your own, shall make your contribution        to mental and physical purity.        I trust in you, my beloved children, and wish        you a profitable and happy new year.He strokes the children's heads. They kiss his hand. Themother embraces them heartily.                            55. ESTATE EXT/DAYSpringtime.The Baroness, Sigi and a new, a forty-ish nanny with thetwins are get out of a carriage in front of the manor.        NARRATOR: Shortly after Easter, in the last week        of April, the Baroness came back with the        children. She was accompanied by a new nurse.        Thus my secret hope that Eva would be able to        come back here, had definitely been dashed.        The nurse was a chubby, middle-aged Italian who        came, as everybody soon learned, from the town        on the Mediterranean coast where the Baroness        had spent the winter.A maid hurries out of the house with reinforcements, theBaroness is being welcomed respectfully and the luggageis being unloaded. The nurse gives instructions inItalian, which leads to some confusion. Then the nannytalks to Sigi who translates to the servants, laughing.Besides, the boy looks transformed: instead of hisformer pale skin color, his face now has a nice tan, hisfair hair has been further bleached by the sun, he hasgrown taller and looks altogether stronger and happier.The Baroness too seems more relaxed and restored.She and Sigi are about to go straight into the housewhen we hear, coming from the other side of thecourtyard        FERDINAND'S VOICE: Sigi!Sigi turns around. Ferdinand has seen him from thewindow and called. Sigi waves back:        SIGI: Hi, Ferdinand!        FERDINAND: Wait! I'm coming down!Sigi wants to run over to the steward's house.                                                           61       BARONESS:   Stay   here,   Sigi,   you   can   see   him       later.       NURSE (in Italian): Let him go, Signora! He's so       happy to be home again.        BARONESS (muses, then smiles): All right, you        can go. But don't stay too long.Sigi hurries off. The Baroness and the nurse look ateach other in agreement. The Baroness smiles faintly.Then they go through the door into the house.For a moment we only see the open door with the darkstairwell behind it.Then we hear the STEPS of the Baron, first on the gravelin the yard. Then Baron comes into frame, and goesthrough the door into the house. He vanishes into thedarkness of the stairwell. From there we hear his voice:        BARON (calling): Beatrix? Beatrix, where are        you?The nurse comes out after a while again        NURSE (calls in Italian): Sigi. Don't you want        to come say hello to your father?But Sigi is talking intensely to Ferdinand on the otherside of the courtyard and doesn't answer.                             56. SCHOOL. INT/DAYCLASSROOMS.The children are going wild. Brawling, sponge and chalkare flying through the air. Some are packing up theirbelongings, preparing to leave the classroom. In short,the way children behave once the lesson is over.Marie stands at the classroom door. She watches herclassmates. The she looks through the door into theCORRIDOR.It's empty. She comes back to the CLASSROOM, but staysat the door so that she can still keep an eye on thecorridor. Apparently, she has been posted there as alookout to warn against the possible arrival of ateacher.The shouting, laughter and brawling goes on. Suddenly,Marie sees the schoolteacher in the CORRIDORwith her father. The two are having an animatedconversation. Marie bursts into the CLASSROOM and closesthe door to muffle the noise, then she shouts to herclassmates:         MARIE: Watch out, he's coming!But with all the shouting and laughter, her voice isn'theard by all of the pupils. The noise dies down, some ofthem stop misbehaving. Somebody picks up the sponge, and                                                                  62the blackboard is quickly cleaned up of the traces ofthe fight. But a small group who had started to chaseeach other around, doesn't hear and keeps at it. Marieshouts to them again, this time louder:        Be quiet! For God's sake! Be quiet!!But as the wild chase goes on and some over-exitedchildren even make fun of her, and she yells at the topof her voice:        QUIET!!!!At that moment, the door opens and the pastor comes inwith the schoolteacher.Almost instantly, the room becomes QUIET. Without sayinga word, the pastor goes over to Marie, grabs her by theear and drags her through the whole classroom to thestove, where he makes her stand, face to the wall. Thepupils remain silent, embarrassed.While the pastor goes back to the black board, puttinghis briefcase on the desk without saying a word, theschoolteacher, who feels slightly responsible for thelack of discipline of his classroom, says:        SCHOOLTEACHER: What's going on here? Why are you        still here? You know that there's a confirmation        class now! Get out!The children disappear quickly. To the first child whotries to sneak out the schoolteacher says:        How about saying good-bye?Immediately all the CHILDREN rushing out say:         Good-bye, Sir! Good-bye, Pastor!Finally, all the children have left the classroom,except eight candidates for confirmation, among themPaul, Xenia and Marie with her face still turned to thewall.The schoolteacher turns to the pastor:        SCHOOLTEACHER: I'm sorry, Pastor. It won't        happen again.The pastor answers with a reserved nod. In an icysilence, he has waited for the all the younger pupils toleave. As the schoolteacher notices that there will beno further reaction from the pastor, he bows slightly tohim and says:        Good-bye, Pastor.        PASTOR: Good-bye.The schoolteacher leaves the room. The pastor turns tothe candidates for confirmation:        Let us pray.They say the LORD'S PRAYER together. Then the pastorsays:        Sit down.                                                           63The students sit down. Marie keeps standing facing thewall. The pastor stops too. After a while he begins totalk.        This is a very sad day for me.        In a few weeks, we all want to celebrate the        confirmation feast together.        For many months I have tried to bring God's word        closer to you, and to make responsible human        beings out of you in His spirit.        And what do I face today? A horde of yelling        monkeys,   without  any   discipline   or   human        dignity, as childish as the seven-year olds,        with whom you're sharing this classroom.        But what makes me even sadder is the fact that        my own daughter is playing the leading role in        this pitiful display.        Last year I bound a white ribbon in her hair.        Well, you all know that white is the color of        innocence. The ribbon was meant to help Marie to        avoid sin, selfishness, envy, indecency, lies        and sloth.        Well, at the start of the year, I was naive        enough to believe, that now, in the year of her        confirmation, she'd become mature enough, and        that she wouldn't need that ribbon any more        I believed that she felt responsible, being the        daughter of the spiritual leader of a Christian        communi...Marie, who all this time has been waiting beside thestove, faints and collapses to the floor.                            57. THE DOCTOR'S HOUSE. INT/NIGHTSTAIRWELL.The only light comes in from the living room. Rudolphcomes down the stairs, wearing a nightshirt.        RUDOLPH (softly): Xeni?He goes into the LIVING ROOM.It's empty.        RUDOLPH (as above, anxiously): Xeni? Where are        you?He goes into the KITCHEN.It's also empty. Rudolph is desperate. He starts to cry.Finally, he goes back to the STAIRWELL and goes up thestairs to his room.On the stairway, he notices light coming from under thedoor of the practice. He goes back down the stairs downagain and opens the door of the PRACTICE.In the bright light, sitting in front of each other, arethe doctor and Xenia. The doctor has his back toRudolph, so that we see Xenia's face first. She sits on                                                            64the visitor's chair. He has placed his chair in front ofhers, and his legs are closed around her legs. She'scrying.The situation is ambiguous, we don't know what hashappened.The noise at the door startles Xenia, she looks atRudolph:         XENIA (startled, her face tearstained): Rudi?!The doctor spins around, and looks stunned to his youngson. Both look as if they have been caught red-handed.         XENIA: What are you doing here? Why aren't you         in bed?Rudolph doesn't really know, what to think of all this,but   being    the  good   child   he   is,  he   answersautomatically:         RUDOLPH: I can't get to sleep.        XENIA: That's why you're wandering around like a        ghost in the middle of the night?        RUDOLPH: I woke up and you weren't there.Short PAUSE. Xenia wipes the tears from her face.        XENIA (trying to smile): Dad has pierced      my        earlobes.        RUDOLPH: Does it hurt?        XENIA: Yes, a bit.        RUDOLPH: That's why you're crying?        XENIA (tries to smile): I'm not crying any more.        DOCTOR (trying to joke): Beauty has to suffer.        That's what they say. At least for girls...He gets up and goes, still seen from behind, to acloset, and puts something into it that we can'trecognize. He's straightens his clothes. Then he goesover to Rudolph:        DOCTOR: Now go to bed again. You too, Xeni.        XENIA: Yes.As Rudolph hesitates and looks at her dubiously, sheexplains, almost eagerly:        I haven't worn earrings for a long time, that's        why my earlobes grew back again.To show him, she grasps one of her ears.        For Whitsun feast, when we all want to look our        best make ourselves look beautiful, I'm getting        new earrings. The ones that Mom had, with        garnets...                                                            65Rudolph looks at her. He doesn't think she's telling thetruth.                            58. RECTORY. THE PASTOR'S STUDY. INT/DAYMarie comes in. She's wearing a nightshirt, her hair isdamp and sticks to her head. She looks sick andfeverish.She closes the door quietly, then goes to her father'sdesk and opens a few drawers. She ends up finding theletter-opener. It has a hilt and looks like a smallsword.She takes the letter-opener, goes to the birdcage, putsthe letter-opener down beside it and grabs the tinycanary. As the bird chirps, she glances round at thedoor, as if to make sure that nobody is coming.        NARRATOR: A few days after Marie's fainting-fit        that frightened us all, and that was followed by        her feverish and debilitated state...She takes the bird into her left hand so that its littlehead is turned upwards, and picks up the letter-openerwith her right hand...                            59. ESTATE. STEWARD'S HOUSE. INT/DAYThe schoolteacher is led by the steward's wife to theliving room. She carries an apron and her sleeves arerolled up. Apparently she was just preparing a cake, andher sticky hands make her open the door with her elbow.Because of the narrator's voice, we don't grasp whatthey're saying, but we understand that she's asking himto come in and wait for the person he wants to see, andthat she can't keep him company now.       NARRATOR:...I went to see the steward, because I       wanted to borrow the carriage for the Whitsun       holidays again.       Since my marriage proposal, Eva had written me       once a week, and I got the feeling that she felt       lost and alone in the city, and was asking me       between the lines to come to see her again,       despite of her father's interdiction.       I wanted to spend Whitsun Saturday with her so       that I could be back on Sunday again and prepare       the confirmation feast with the pastor.       The steward had gone to the sawmill, but was       supposed to be back any minute. His wife, who       was busy preparing for Whitsun, asked me into       the living room and to wait there for his       return.                                                           66The steward's wife has left the room. The schoolteachersits around, bored. After a while he gets up, goes tothe window and looks out.The courtyard is empty.Suddenly, the schoolteacher hears a female VOICE in thenext room SPEAKING softly.He listens, then he goes to the wing door and looksthrough the gap on the etched glass-window of the doorinto the next room.There, Liesl sits beside the cradle and talks quietly tothe baby.The schoolteacher opens the door. Liesl sees him, getsup and greets him politely with a curtsy:        LIESL: Good morning, Sir.         SCHOOLTEACHER: Hello, Liesl..Smiling, the schoolteacher goes to the cradle and looksinto it.         SCHOOLTEACHER: He's cute..       LIESL: Yes, he is.       SCHOOLTEACHER: Do you like him.       LIESL: Yes. Very much.       SCHOOLTEACHER: He was very sick last winter, I       was told.        LIESL: Yes. Very sick. But the doctor cured him.        With God's help.PAUSE. The schoolteacher looks out the window to see ifthe steward isn't coming.        SCHOOLTEACHER:   Maybe,  I'll   pop  back   this        evening.        LIESL: I'm sure Father will be back for coffee        at four.She looks at the grandfather clock, that indicatesquarter to four. The schoolteacher thinks for a moment,then he goes to the living room:        SCHOOLTEACHER: Then, I'll go sit down again next        door.       LIESL: Can I bring you something?      A   cup   of       coffee. I'm sure it's ready.        SCHOOLTEACHER (smiling at her eagerness): No,        no. Thanks.He stands in the door:        I'll sit down over there again and just wait.He wants to close the door behind himself. Suddenly                                                             67       LIESL says: Sir!       SCHOOLTEACHER: Yes?        LIESL: Can dreams come true?The schoolteacher smiles, surprised at the unexpectedquestion:        SCHOOLTEACHER: That depends, why?       LIESL(serious): On what?       SCHOOLTEACHER (smile): On what does it depend?       Well if you dream of getting the first prize at       the school feast, and study hard for it, then       your dream can come true.        LIESL, shakes her head, quietly: That's not what        I meant.The schoolteacher feels that she has something on hermind and asks, this time without irony:        SCHOOLTEACHER: Well, what did you mean then?She looks at him, wondering if she should really discussit. He nods to encourage her.        LIESL: I mean, if you dream something in your        sleep, I mean, if you really dream it in your        sleep, can it come true?        SCHOOLTEACHER (also serious): Why, what did you        dream?She bows her head.The schoolteacher thinks for a moment, then he goes overto her.        Come on, tell me. You have something on your        mind, haven't you?She shakes her bowed head. But suddenly, she starts tocry:        LIESL (crying): I always dream such horrible        things.        SCHOOLTEACHER (dear): Tell me what you've been        dreaming?She sobs, he takes out a handkerchief and hands it toher:        Take this. Now, calm down again. And then tell        me what's going on.Liesl takes the handkerchief, blows her nose and wipesaway her tears. She doesn't completely manage to holdher tears back, and breathes haltingly. She hands thehandkerchief back to the schoolteacher.        LIESL: Thanks.The schoolteacher puts the handkerchief away with animperceptible smile and then says reassuringly:                                                           68        SCHOOLTEACHER: All right. Now go on.The girl sniffles a couple of times again, then swallowsand says quietly:        LIESL: I dreamt that the Hansi ≠ the midwife's        odd little boy ...        SCHOOLTEACHER (reassuringly): I know, I know.        LIESL: - ...that something very bad is going to        happen to him.        SCHOOLTEACHER: Something very bad?Liesl nods eagerly.        SCHOOLTEACHER: Like what?        LIESL: I don't know. Something like what        happened to Sigi not long ago. But even worse.She starts to cry again:        But he's so sweet. He harms no one.Touched, the schoolteacher puts his arm around Liesl'sshoulder.        SCHOOLTEACHER: All right. All right. That was        just a dream. You needn't take it so seriously.        LIESL (crying): They always make fun of him,        because he doesn't really...        SCHOOLTEACHER (calmly): Yes, I know, but nobody        will do him any harm, you can be sure of that.Liesl can't calm down.        Do you want my handkerchief back?She shakes her head.        SCHOOLTEACHER: What gave you the idea that your        dream would come true?She just shakes her head, and keeps on crying. Then hetakes the handkerchief out again and hands it to her. Asshe doesn't take it, he nudges her. She looks up,confused. He holds the handkerchief again with acheerful nod. She takes it and blows her nose. The sheslowly calms down.        SCHOOLTEACHER (now "reasonable" in order to        "calm her down"): Dreams don't come true. Let        alone that kind.She shrugs her shoulders, as if she disagrees with whathe's saying. Her head bowed she stands before him,holding his handkerchief.She breathes a few more times, then says with an almost"adult" voice:        LIESL(serious): But sometimes my dreams do come        true.                                                           69         SCHOOLTEACHER: What do you mean?PAUSE.         LIESL says: Last winter, before Putzl (she         points to the baby) became ill, I dreamt that my         brother put him beside the open window, so that         he'd die.         And the day the window was open and he caught a         chill and he almost died.The schoolteacher is completely perplexed. At first hedoesn't know what to say.        SCHOOLTEACHER: What are you saying there? That's        complete nonsense!Liesl bows her head again.         SCHOOLTEACHER: Somebody probably didn't close         the window properly.         What gave you that idea? Why would your brother         do such a thing?         LIESL,(defiantly, as he's not believing her):         Because he's jealous.         SCHOOLTEACHER: And because you believe that, you         dreamt it. It doesn't mean anything at all. It's         just a coincidence.         LIESL (keeping her head bowed): All right.The schoolteacher bends over to catch her gaze.         SCHOOLTEACHER: Look at me.She looks at him reluctantly, maintaining her defiantreserve.         SCHOOLTEACHER: Don't tell such stories to         anybody!         You obviously don't realize the harm you can do         with it.Again she looks down at the floor.        You didn't tell the story         to   your   parents,        didn't you?She shakes her head.         All right then.         Forget it quickly.   I   shall    forget     it,   too.         Promise?As she doesn't answer, he repeats:        Promise?                                                                   70She nods almost imperceptibly.        Good.        Now can I have my handkerchief back...He holds his hand out to her. Astonished she looks atthe handkerchief in her hands. She had forgotten itcompletely, and gives it back the schoolteacher.        Thank you.He pockets the handkerchief.        Now, we both have a secret. And you promise me        that it will remain a secret between us. All        right?She nods reluctantly. He insists, seeks her gaze:        Yes?!        LIESL (reluctantly): Yes.        SCHOOLTEACHER: Well. All right then.        You don't have to worry. Nothing will happen to        Hansi.        (smiling): Nobody is jealous of him.She glances at him to see whether he's making fun ofher. He looks at her seriously and gives her a nod thatdemands an answer. She nods briefly. But it isn't clearwhether she just does it to please him.        Dreams don't come true. That only happens in        fairy-tales. Forget all about it.He looks at her, as she stands there, head bowed.Finally he smiles and tries to "crack a joke" to makethe matter less serious:        Do you know what they did to little girls who        predicted the future in ancient times? They        burned them at the stake as witches.She looks up at him, round-eyed.                            60. RECTORY. THE PASTOR'S STUDY. INT/DAYThe pastor comes through the door, goes to his desk, andis about to put down his briefcase.The dead bird lies in the middle of the desk with itswings spread out. The pastor's letter-opener is stuck inits neck - only the hilt sticks out from its beak.                                                                                       7161. STREET. EXT/DAYThe schoolteacher and Eva drive in the carriage. In thebackground, we catch glimpses of the town.        NARRATOR: We had arranged to meet at the town        railway station, since Eva wanted to avoid being        seen with me. She was living with distant        relatives,   who    were    apparently   reporting        regularly to Eva's parents about her life-style.        She had become thinner which made her even        prettier, and once again I was ravished by her        mixture   of   shyness    and    almost  childlike        outspokenness.        EVA (imitating somebody): ..."...You want your        hair parted r to the right or to the left?" "How        about one parting to the left and one to the        right"?Both laugh heartily.        All the people in the saloon were laughing their        heads   off.    Even    Mr.    Murer,   who's   so        distinguished that he never cracks a smile, had        to laugh.SHORT PAUSE, in which the laughter fades down.        SCHOOLTEACHER: Then, it isn't really so awful,        is it?        EVA: No. But sweeping up hair all day ≠ honestly        the twins were more fun, I must say.        But it's all right. I can't really complain.The schoolteacher looks at her sideways, smiling:        SCHOOLTEACHER: No?She looks at him, doesn't understand that he's trying tomake her complain about their forced separation, andsays cheerfully:        EVA: No. Really.The schoolteacher exchanges a smiling glance with her,then looks back at the road:        SCHOOLTEACHER (smiling): And apart from the        twins, there's nothing you're missing?She looks at him, surprised. Suddenly, she understands.She shakes her head with a smile, then takes his handfor a short moment, as if she were apologizing for herlack of sensitivity.        EVA: Oh, you of course!He looks at her hand on his, but she already haswithdrawn it. Both seem very happy. After a few moments,during which the horse keeps trotting, Eva leans againstthe schoolteacher and puts her head against hisshoulder. But the shaking of the carriage on the ruttedroad makes that position untenable and so they sit sideby side again and drive on. Finally                                                             72       EVA says: And how is the nurse? Does she only       speak Italian?       SCHOOLTEACHER: I   don't   know.   That's   what   the       steward told me.        EVA: I see.At that moment the road crosses a brook, that runsthrough a small wood. The schoolteacher steers thecarriage on to a trail that branches off the road afterthe bridge.        EVA: Where are you going?       SCHOOLTEACHER: Over there, into the forest       beside the brook. We can picnic over there. I       brought a basket of food.       EVA (softly): I don't want that.        SCHOOLTEACHER (perplexed): Why?Eva looks down and shakes her head. The schoolteacherstops the carriage, turns to her:        What's going on?        EVA: Nothing. Please.Now he understands. He smiles although he can't reallyunderstand that she's been thinking such a thing of him.Now he talks to her almost as to a child, astonished andreassuringly.        SCHOOLTEACHER:   But  I   don't  want   anything        forbidden from you. I just wanted you to enjoy        the picnic.She looks up at him.        EVA: Please.        SCHOOLTEACHER (astonished): Do you think, I        might want to bring disgrace on my future wife?She keeps looking at him pleadingly. Finally he givesin, slightly disappointed:        All right then. I'll turn over there.He drives on. After a few meters, Eva puts her hand onhis hands and on the reins. He stops the carriage, shelooks at him.        EVA: Thanks.He doesn't know what say. They look at each other.Suddenly Eva leans forward and kisses him on the lipsvery cautiously. They remain that way for a long whilewithout their bodies touching each other.After separating, they forget at first to keepbreathing. Then, once the worst of the confusion hasabated, they both turn away from each other. Theschoolteacher lets the horse start trotting again, and                                                                73they sit side by side on the bumping vehicle, lookingstraight ahead, quiet and overwhelmed by the happinessof the moment.                            62. CHURCH INT/DAYThe church is packed.The 8 candidates for confirmation are kneeling at theCommunion bench. One after the other, the pastor putsthe cup to their lips.       PASTOR:       Accept and drink!       This is the blood of the New Testament,       Shed for the forgiveness of your sins.As he reaches Marie, who is kneeling fifth in line, hehesitates a long moment. For so long, that this causes afew irritated stares from the devout parish. Even morethan the other children, Marie is also numb withexcitement. It almost looks like she might faint again.But then he holds out the cup to her too, and shedrinks:       Accept and drink!       That is the blood of the new will,       spilled for you so that your sins         will   be       forgiven.He wipes the cup, where Marie's mouth drank ≠ as he doesafter each child - and goes on to the next one,repeating the rite...                            63. FOREST EXT/NIGHTDistant VOICES. At first incomprehensible. Gradually weunderstand them better:        VOICES: Hansi? Where are you? Give us a sign!        Hansi, where are you?Here and there silhouettes appear in the half-light.Some carry lanterns, other torches. It takes some timebefore they get nearer and become recognizable: they'remen and women from the village.After a while        MAN'S VOICE(calling): Over here. He's here.We follow those running over: Bound to a tree is a smallboy. His whole head is wrapped up in rags. A small slithas been left open so the nose can breathe. He MOANS.                                                             74A paper has been tied around his neck with a whiteribbon.The people hurry toward the child, free the child of itsfetters. The child slumps down, his head is unwrapped,covered in blood: it's the mongoloid son of the midwife.Astonished, somebody reads the words written in blockletters on the paper):        FOR I THE LORD YOUR GOD AM A JEALOUS GOD,        VISITING THE INIQUITY OF THE FATHERS UPON THE        CHILDREN TO THE THIRD AND THE FOURTH GENERATION        OF THOSE WHO HATE ME.                            64. SCHOOL. INT/DAYCORRIDOR.Marie, Martin, Paul, Georg, and a couple of otherchildren are waiting at the classroom door. They remainsilent. They're listening.        NARRATOR:   After    this   intricate  atrocity        committed on the retarded boy, even the Baron        was finally convinced that it would be more        intelligent to call upon the professional help        of the county's police force.        So a few days later a couple of plainclothes        policemen arrived and, after a visit to the        several of the crime scenes, started to ask in        various homes if anyone had noticed anything        suspicious.CLASSROOMThe two detectives question Liesl in the presence of theschoolteacher and become more and more aggressive. Lieslends up crying.        NARRATOR: After learning of Hansi's torture, I        didn't think at first of what Liesl had told me.        When it came back to my mind, I at first        hesitated to tell the authorities about it.        Because of such an absurd coincidence, I didn't        want to jeopardize the reputation and inner        peace of the steward's family.        But when I heard that Hansi might loose his        eyesight because of his injuries, one afternoon        I made Liesl come to school and tell the police        officers about her dream.        FIRST POLICE OFFICER: ...Thank God, we're not as        stupid as you might think.                                                           75        LIESL (crying, desperate): But I only dreamt it.PAUSE. The officers exchange an impatient look with theschoolteacher, who himself doesn't really know what tothink of Liesl's story. He looks at her thoughtfully.The police officer turns to the girl again:        FIRST POLICE OFFICER: Now listen carefully! I'll        give you a last chance: you tell me, who told        you about the plan to torture the boy, and we        won't tell anybody who told us. All right?Liesl shakes her head desperately, crying again. Thepolice officer looks at the schoolteacher. The latterdoubts whether he should speak up. He feels sorry forthe girl. Finally, he says:        SCHOOLTEACHER:   She's    already   dreamed   of        something that has come true.       FIRST POLICE OFFICER (ironic): Is that so? And       what was it, if I may ask?       SCHOOLTEACHER (wanting to spare her      talking       about it): Something that happened       in her       family.       FIRST POLICE OFFICER (just as before): I see.       Something to do with her family. And have you       checked if it was true?        SCHOOLTEACHER (irritated): No.The police officer looks at him, grunts with disdain,and turns to his colleague:        FIRST POLICE OFFICER (scornfully): Well, all        that may be true. Maybe we're really dealing        here with an authentic clairvoyant, and we don't        realize how lucky we are. Maybe we only need to        ask her, who's behind all this. The we send her        to bed, she dreams a bit, and tomorrow she tells        us who did it. How about that? Everything's        possible, isn't it?Suddenly, he yells at the girl:        Stop crying!Liesl jumps up with fear. The police officer standsright in front of her:       Your deceitful whining won't work with me. I've       got other ways to make you talk. I don't believe       in witches and magicians, let alone that a       chubby little girl like you has supernatural       hallucinations. Therefore you'd better get used       to the idea of telling the truth, because you       won't bet rid of me until you've come clean. Is       that clear?       All right, and now we're going to visit your       parents to see what they think of your version       of the story.                                                           76He pulls the girl to her feet. She's thoroughlyintimidated, and sniffles faintly. Then he leads hertoward the door, at the same time turning to theschoolteacher:        I'd be grateful if you came too.The schoolteacher finds the policeman's behavior towardthe child exaggeratedly aggressive, but he followsreluctantly:        SCHOOLTEACHER: Of course.The police officer opens the door to theCORRIDORand almost bumps into a group of pupils that haveassembled there.        FIRST POLICE OFFICER: Oooops! What do we have        here?           MARIE (kindly): Good afternoon. Good afternoon,           Sir.        CHILDREN (as before): Good afternoon. Good        afternoon, Sir.Obviously the schoolteacher didn't expect them, butdoesn't want to show it in front of the police.        SCHOOLTEACHER: Good afternoon.           FIRST POLICE OFFICER: Why are you eavesdropping?        MARIE (politely): We saw from outside that the        schoolteacher was having visitors. We didn't        want to intrude. We were just waiting to talk to        the schoolteacher.PAUSE. The police officer looks at the schoolteacher:        SCHOOLTEACHER: What do you want?        MARIE (as if she was too shy to talk in front of        strangers: We wanted to ask you something about        Hansi.Again, the police officer looks at the schoolteacher.        SCHOOLTEACHER: What is it?           MARIE (hesitates a moment, then "screws up her           courage" and asks): We heard he isn't well. We           just wanted to ask if we could be of any help.                                                                                             7765. THE MIDWIFE'S HOUSE INT/NIGHTThe doctor carefully examines Hansi's wounds. Especiallythe areas around eyes that are badly affected. The boymoans softly.The midwife stands beside him, trying to stay calm, butshe is paralyzed with fear, and visibly still in a stateof shock.It's very quiet. The doctor speaks with a soothing,almost tender voice to the child, who keeps on moaning:         DOCTOR (softly): All right... Everything's all         right, Hansi... I know, it hurts... You've got         to be patient... everything will be fine         again... everything...He has finished his treatment (and has bandaged theboy's eyes again), and wants get up. But Hansi's handclings to his, and holds him back. He hesitates amoment. The doctor and the midwife exchange a briefglance. Then, the doctor cautiously frees his hand fromthe child's.         I have to go now, Hansi. Don't worry, I'll be         back tomorrow.The boy moans louder and tries again to grasp the handof the doctor, who he can't see. Brief exchange ofglances between the doctor and the midwife, who ends upsitting on Hansi's bed, taking the boy's hands.         MIDWIFE: It's all right, Hansi. Don't be afraid.         The Doctor will be back.The doctor motions to the midwife that she should staywith the child, and leaves the room silently and almosthastily.                            66. LANDSCAPE WITH A BROOK AND PASTURES EXT/DAYSitting at a brook, Sigi, Ferdinand and Georg have cutwillow twigs with their pocketknives and are now carvingwhistles out of them. Their feet dangle in the water,they're concentrated on their work.Georg is the first to have finished. Proudly he tries itout, but the little whistle doesn't sound very good. Hehides his disappointment, and keeps on carving toimprove the sound.Then Sigi's whistle is ready and it sounds very good.Sigi is delighted. After a short and proud look over tohis rivals, he leans back into the grass and keeps onwhistling.Georg looks with irritation at the "braggart", and keepson carving. Then he gives it another try, but thewhistle doesn't sound much better than before.Sigi's   whistling   makes   Georg's  seem   ridiculous.Ferdinand looks at Georg with a gloating grin.                                                            78Suddenly Georg pounces on Sigi and tries to grab hiswhistle. Sigi fights back and refuses to let go.Ferdinand also gets up and watches the two, grinning.Even if Sigi is no longer the weakling he used to bebefore his stay in Italy, Georg, who is three yearsolder than him, is much stronger: with the weight of hiswhole body he charges at Sigi, making him fall backwardinto the shallow water of the brook, and takes hiswhistle away.The shock almost knocks out Sigi, and though the streamisn't deep, half of his head lies under the flowingwater. Georg sees the danger, but his pride prevents himfrom helping him, as it means admitting his own unjustbehavior. For a moment he hesitates, a helpless anddefiant grin on his face. But Ferdinand has alreadyjumped into the water and pulls out Sigi, who shakes hishead to fully come to his senses.Ferdinand looks up at Georg, who is standing on thebank, still holding the whistle in his hand. Then Georgpoints his finger at him, and says furiously andguiltily.        GEORG (threatening): If you rat on me, you'll be        sorry!                            67. RECTORY. STUDY. INT/DAYThe pastor sits at his desk, working. A KNOCK is heard.        PASTOR: Come in!Florian comes in, hesitantly. In his hand, he carries abirdcage (we've already seen it in Scene 49 in the boy'sbedroom at night). In the cage is the bird that Florianhad found on Thanksgiving day, and who has recovered inthe meantime.        PASTOR: Yes?The boy looks embarrassed. He glances at his father,then comes over with the cage and puts it carefully onhis father's desk. As Florian approaches, the pastorlooked on, amazed. After putting down the cage, Floriansteps back a little, then stops, his head slightlybowed.        PASTOR (not really understanding): What is it?        What do you want?        FLORIAN (softly): For Pipsi. (PAUSE. Then even        more softly): Because Father is sad.The pastor looks at him, doesn't know how to react.Then,   with  a   hoarse   voice  and  trying to  lookindifferent, he says:        PASTOR: Thank you.                                                           79        FLORIAN (as apprehensive in front of his        father's perceptible emotion): You're welcome,        Father.For a moment, neither of them knows what to do. Then theboy leaves the room.The pastor follows him with his eyes. Then, he sitsdown. He tries to keep his composure, but in the end hebursts into tears. He sobs haltingly, trying hard notlet it be heard.                                68.THE STEWARD'S HOUSE INT/EXT/DAYTHE CHILDREN'S ROOM.Georg stands at the window and looks down at theCOURTYARDComing from   the   manor,   the   steward   is   walking   overbriskly.THE CHILDREN'S ROOM.Georg leaves the window and sits down at his table,doing his homework.We hear the FRONT DOOR opening downstairs, then thefather's hasty STEPS on the stairs.Finally, the father appears in the door. He's out ofbreath, furious, and tries to speak quietly        STEWARD: Give me that whistle!Georg looks at his father, "not understanding".        GEORG: I beg your pardon?        STEWARD (forcedly, with threatening calm): Give        me that whistle!        GEORG: What whistle?At this, the steward pounces on the boy and smacks himso hard that he falls out of his chair.        Give it to me!        GEORG (on the ground): What whistle?The steward yanks him up and shoves him against thewall. Georg stumbles over the table which is standing inthe way, and lies back on the table top, trying toprotect his face with his hands.        STEWARD: Give away it to me, or I'll kill you.        GEORG (half moaning): I have no whistle.The steward lets go of him and starts to beat                himfuriously.                                                                   80        GEORG (screaming): Ouch! ...Ouch!!        STEWARD (beat): You bastard, you wretch!        GEORG (scream): Ouch! Ouch! !! Please don'tAt that moment, attracted by the noise, Emma, themother, appears:        EMMA: For God's sake, Georg, what are you doing?        What has the boy done?The mother's arrival has snapped the father out of hisblind rage. He glances at her, then turns to the boyagain, breathless with excitement, but forcing himselfto be calm:        STEWARD: For the last time: give it to me!        GEORG (almost crying with pain): But I don't        know what you mean, Father.The mother looks uncomprehendingly from one to theother, then turns pleadingly to her husband:        EMMA: What's going on? What are you talking        about?        STEWARD (to Georg): You know exactly what I        mean.Again the mother looks from one to the other, trying tosave the situation:        EMMA: But if he says so! Georg! What's going on?The steward turns to her, annoyed by her insistence,looks at her for a long moment, then at Georg again andturns on his heels and leaves the room.STAIRWELL.The steward runs down the stairs. The mother followshim.        EMMA (excited): Georg! Please wait! What did the        boy do?! Please, tell me! Why are you so        furious?She reaches the steward as he is just about to open thefront door and places herself in front of him.        EMMA (imploring, "reasonable"): Georg! Please!        Calm down. If you could tell me...        STEWARD (also "reasonable", in order to get rid        of her): Please don't interfere. Leave me alone        now! I have to go back to the Baron. He...At that moment we hear from upstairs the full SOUND ofSigi's whistle s from above, wild and lasting.For a moment, the steward is paralyzed, then he seizesthe horsewhip hanging from hook in the wardrobe anddashes upstairs. We hear him thrashing the boy in the                                                           81room, and soon the WHISTLING is replaced by Georg'sSCREAMS OF PAINAfter a short hesitation, the mother runs upstairs afterher husband, and we now hear her trying in vain tryingto control her husband.        EMMA: Georg! Please! Stop it! Don't kill him...!                             69. ESTATE. DINING ROOM. COURTYARD. INT/EXT/NIGHTThe meal is over. The Baroness watches the maid clearingthe table and putting everything away on a tray.The Baron has stood up, standing with his back to hiswife. He pours himself a glass of brandy.        BARON: ... with the birches over there in Aigen        that should make about six-thousand cubic        meters. Working steadily, they should have        finished it within three weeks. If until the end        of the month we...The maid has left with the tray.        BARONESS (interrupts him): I won't stay here.         BARON (doesn't understand): What did you say?         BARONESS: I won't stay here.         BARON (turns around to her): What do you mean         BARONESS: What I mean is that I shall leave with         the children.         BARON: What do you mean: you're leaving with the         children?         BARONESS:   Come  on,   Armin!  It's   not   that         difficult to understand, is it?PAUSE.         BARON: May I ask you how you plan to do that?         BARONESS (quiet): I don't know yet. But in any         case, we're leaving this place.         BARON (sarcastic): We.Look of the Baroness ("I don't need that kind ofirony").         BARONESS: Yes.The maid enters to clear the rest of the table. It leadsto a longer PAUSE. The Baron drinks his brandy, goes tothe window, waits. As the maid leaves the room, shelooks at the Baroness inquiringly:                                                             82         BARONESS (to the maid): I don't need you any         longer. Thank you.         MAID: Good night, Baroness. Good night, Baron.        BARONESS: Good night.Even after the maid has left, they remain SILENT forquite a long while. Finally, she says        BARONESS: I returned from Italy only out of        deceny toward you. I wanted to give us a chance.         BARON (turns around): You wanted me "to give me         a chance"?!         BARONESS: Yes.         BARON: Well, that's brilliant! And did I miss my         chance? Or what?PAUSE.         BARONESS (quietly): Do you think that will help         us solve the problem?         BARON: What?         BARONESS: Your sarcasm.        BARON: Actually, what is the problem that has to        be solved?The Baroness looks at him, then gets up and wants toleave the room.        BARON (suddenly yelling): You stay here!!She turns around, looks at him.        BARON (softer): You only leave this room if I        tell you to do so.She looks at him.        BARONESS: Fine.She goes back to her chair and sits down.         BARONESS: I wanted to spare you this, but you         force me to do it:         During our stay with Uncle Edoardo I fell in         love with a man. He's from Lombardy, he works in         the banking business and helped Uncle Edoardo in         a financial matter. He courted me and was also         very fond of the children. If Sigi has blossomed         and grown so healthy, it's largely thanks to         him.         Despite all this, we came back.         Because I feel committed to you. But I can't         stand this place any longer. Not so much for me         personally, though I can't say that life with         you is exactly thrilling for a woman of my age.         But if I leave this place, it's because I don't                                                            83         want Sigi, and later the twins, to grow up in         surroundings dominated by malice, envy, apathy         and brutality. What happened with Sigi's whistle         was the last straw. I'm sick and tired of         persecutions, threats and perverse acts of         revenge.PAUSE.         BARON: Did you sleep with him?         BARONESS   (laughing   scornfully):   You   don't         understand anything.         BARON: Did you sleep with him?PAUSE.         BARONESS (quietly): No. I didn't sleep with him.PAUSE.        BARON: You're lying, aren't you?The Baroness looks at him. Then she gets up, about toleave the room again. At the same moment, somebodyKNOCKS at the door. After a short gesture of irritation        BARON (irked): Come in!The steward appears.        STEWARD: Good evening. Could I talk to you for a        moment, Baron?         BARON (annoyed): Can't it wait until tomorrow?        STEWARD:   It's  really   urgent.   Normally,  I        wouldn't have disturbed you so late.Annoyed, the Baron leaves the room with him. As he goesout, the steward greets the Baroness with a nod.Once the door is closed, she stops for a moment, goes tothe window, and looks out pensive. She ends up going tothe small bar and pours herself a glass of brandy. Herhands are shaking a little. She drinks from the glass,goes back to the window and looks out waiting, taking asip from now and then. Below in theCOURTYARDa few people walk around nervously. But it doesn't lookparticularly unusual. A saddled horse is led into thestable. Finally, the door of theDINING ROOMopens again. The Baron comes back inside. He looksdistressed. The Baroness doesn't know whether this isthe result of her conversation, or of the messagebrought by the steward. The Baron paces a few steps,pondering, then glances at his wife. Finally, she asks        BARONESS: What's going on?                                                             84       BARON: They've shot the heir to the throne of       Austria. In Sarajevo.                            70. VILLAGE AND SURROUNDING LANDSCAPE EXT/DAYThe same setting as in Scene 57. The countryside in allits summer splendor.       NARRATOR: The news spread around the village       like wildfire. What would the consequences be?       The first person who spoke the word WAR, was       severely contradicted. But once it had been       uttered, it remained at the center of all our       thoughts in a curiously stubborn way.       I wanted to go to the town as quickly as       possible, in order to discuss it with Eva, what       we should do if war broke out. Perhaps her       father would now agree to an earlier marriage.       I asked the Baroness for the bicycle, with which       Eva had visited her parents some time ago. The       following weekend I planned use it to ride to       town and see her.                            71. ESTATE EXT/DAYThe schoolteacher is pushing the bicycle out of themanor house. He says good-bye to a maid, who closes thedoor behind him. Some SHOUTING o.s. makes him looktoward the steward's house: the steward comes out withthe midwife, and it looks like he's throwing her outwith a flood of angry insults.        NARRATOR: When I went to the estate on Friday        evening to pick up the bicycle, so I could take        it with me to the school, and get going early,        as the trip was a quite long one, I witnessed a        strange confrontation:        STEWARD: ...completely mad! Go if you want.        He'll throw you out on your ear.        Slandering other people and creating trouble.        That's all we need now!        Get out and never come back again! This is        unbelievable!        Go ahead, do whatever you think you have to do!        You're hysterical!        MIDWIFE (simultaneously): ...I'll go to the        Baron. We'll see what he says. You won't silence        me. Who do you think you are?! You'll see. I'll                                                           85        tell him that you tried to prevent me from        giving the police a statement.Angrily the steward slams the door behind him. At firstthe midwife doesn't know what to do. Finally she turnsaway from the door and starts to cross the yard. There,she sees the schoolteacher. She comes over to him.        SCHOOLTEACHER: Good afternoon, Mrs. Wagner.        What's happening?         MIDWIFE (very excited): Good afternoon. Can I         borrow your bicycle?         SCHOOLTEACHER: It's not mine.         MIDWIFE: Could I borrow it just the same?         SCHOOLTEACHER: I just borrowed it myself.      I         going to ride to town, to see my fiancÈe..         MIDWIFE: Please! Lend it to me!         SCHOOLTEACHER: Why do you need it? Where do you         want to go?         MIDWIFE: I must go to town.         SCHOOLTEACHER: What for?         MIDWIFE: I asked the steward for a carriage, but         that stubborn fool won't agree to anything.PAUSE.         Please! Lend me the bicycle.        SCHOOLTEACHER: Why? What is going on?After hesitating a while        MIDWIFE: I have to go to the police in town. I        now know who committed all these crimes.         SCHOOLTEACHER (flabbergasted): Who?         MIDWIFE: Will you let me have the bicycle?         SCHOOLTEACHER: Why don't you tell me?         MIDWIFE: From now on I shall only talk to the         police. I won't let them insult me (turning to         the steward's house): As you just saw.         SCHOOLTEACHER: Can't the doctor can lend you his         horse?        MIDWIFE: I don't know how to ride.The schoolteacher looks at her inquisitively, because hestill doesn't understand what it's all about, but shedoesn't respond, and says:                                                            86         MIDWIFE: Please! Believe me! (She hesitates and         adds, now quietly and imploringly):         My son told me who did it to him. He may loose         his eyesight.         Please, you let me have the bicycle!The schoolteacher looks at her. The midwife lookspitiful: she tries to smile at him pleadingly, tears arestreaming down her face.Finally, he gives the bicycle to her. She grabs itquickly, says         Thanks!and rides away. The schoolteacher remains behind, alone.He stands pensive, then he goes slowly back to thevillage.         NARRATOR: The state that woman was in, who I         knew was level-headed, had deeply impressed me.         What had her son told her, that she didn't dare         tell anybody?                             72. VILLAGE STREET. EXT/DUSKThe schoolteacher goes home.TRACKING SHOT.        NARRATOR: With each step I took from the estate        back to the school, I felt more foolish for        having given away the bicycle.As he passes the midwife's house, he sees behind thefence in the garden, half hidden behind the bushes,Marie and a few other children. The shutters of thehouse are closed.        As I passed the midwife's house, I saw Marie,        Martin, and a few other children in the garden.The schoolteacher stops, watches the children. After afew moments, they notice that somebody is watching them.        MARIE: Good evening, Sir.         SCHOOLTEACHER: Good evening, Marie.         CHILDREN: Good evening, Sir.         SCHOOLTEACHER: What are you doing here?         MARIE: We wanted to see how Hansi was doing.PAUSE.         SCHOOLTEACHER: But can't       you   see   that   the         shutters are closed.PAUSE.                                                                 87         MARIE: Yes. We were worried. We saw Mrs. Wagner         riding off on a bicycle. So we wondered what had         happened to Hansi.PAUSE.        SCHOOLTEACHER: Go home now. Nobody said you        could come in here.The children go out slowly. They open the wooden gate inthe fence, and go out into the street. They're visiblyembarrassed at being caught by the schoolteacher whenthey were doing something wrong. Some avoid theschoolteacher's eyes, while others mutter a greeting, asif they wanted to say goodbye, as they went away. Theschoolteacher looks annoyed. As Marie steps out of thegarden door, he says:        SCHOOLTEACHER: You better go back home now,        hurry.Marie doesn't seem to feel guilty at all. Again shegreets him politely.        MARIE: Good evening, Teacher.        SCHOOLTEACHER (reluctantly): Good evening.The children go away. The schoolteacher also goes on hisway. After a few steps he turns around and looks at thechildren, then walks on.         NARRATOR: Then I thought of Liesl's dream again.         What if Liesl hadn't dreamt, but had known, that         Hansi was going to be tortured. Whose crimes did         she know of? Whose name had she refused to         reveal?         The strong interest of the children in Hansi         seemed strange to me, considering that they had         usually refused to have any contact with him         because of his disability, or only dealt with         him in a rather disdainful manner.The schoolteacher stops. He ponders about this. Then hegoes back to the midwife's house.         Suddenly I wondered why the midwife had closed         the shutters of the house. Nobody in the village         ever shut their house. Why had the midwife         locked her boy in?He has reached the front of the house again. Indeed,with its closed shutters, it looks uninhabited. Onlybecause of the tidy little front garden, could one tellthat somebody lived there.The schoolteacher opens the garden gate and goes up tothe house. He tries to open the door and then theshutters. Everything is well shut. He peers through thecracks in the wooden shutters.        SCHOOLTEACHER: Hansi? Can you hear me? Hansi!                                                            88Nobody seems to answer. For a short moment theschoolteacher disappears behind the house, apparentlylooking for another way to get inside. But he soon comesback without having found anything.        NARRATOR: If the midwife couldn't take care of        him, she would have entrusted the boy to me, or        to the doctor. But since the night he was        mistreated, I hadn't seen him again.He leaves the midwife's house and hurries to theneighboring house, the doctor's.        I decided to ask the doctor directly.He enters the property, goes up to the entrance andrings. Nobody answers. He rings again, then he sees anote tacked up:          The doctor's practice is closed                until further notice                            73. RECTORY. INT/NIGHTSTAIRWELL.The pastor's wife and the schoolteacher stand before theclosed front door.        PASTOR'S WIFE: His daughter? Wasn't she with you        at your school?        SCHOOLTEACHER: Yes, she was.        PASTOR'S WIFE: And she didn't say anything?The schoolteacher shakes his head. They both remainsilent and pensive.        SCHOOLTEACHER: I have a request.        PASTOR'S WIFE: Yes?        SCHOOLTEACHER: Could I ask Marie and Martin?        PASTOR'S WIFE: Don't you want to wait for my        husband? He's at the church. The service will be        over in a quarter of an hour. But if you insist.        Please, come in.She opens the doorLIVING ROOMand points to a chair.        Please be seated. Please. I'll fetch the kids        for you.                                                           89She leaves the room. The schoolteacher remains standing.Waiting.Finally, the pastor's wife comes back with the twochildren.         MARIE and MARTIN: Good evening, Sir.         SCHOOLTEACHER: Good evening.PAUSE.         THE PASTOR'S WIFE: Don't you want to sit down?        SCHOOLTEACHER (who hasn't thought of it): Yes.        Perhaps. With pleasure.They   sit   down.   The  children   sit  opposite   theschoolteacher.        PASTOR'S WIFE: Can I offer you something? ,        (smiling faintly): A cup of coffee? Like during        the piano lessonsFirst the schoolteacher wants to refuse, then he decidesto accept so as to get rid of the woman, and be alonewith the children.        SCHOOLTEACHER: Yes, with pleasure. That's very        kind of you.        PASTOR'S WIFE: I'll be back in a minute.The schoolteacher turns to the children:        SCHOOLTEACHER: Did you know that the Doctor was        leaving Eichwald?Short PAUSE.        MARIE: No.         SCHOOLTEACHER: But you don't seem surprised at         my question.         MARIE: Our mother told us when she came to fetch         us.         SCHOOLTEACHER:   And   Xenia   didn't    tell    you         anything about it?        MARIE: No.She looks at Martin who confirms it:        MARTIN: No.         SCHOOLTEACHER (incredulously): Not a word? It's         very unusual for a child not to tell his         classmates before going away on a trip.         MARIE (unimpressed):   Xenia   never    talks   much         about home.         SCHOOLTEACHER: Well, that's something completely         different?!                                                                90Apparently Marie doesn't take it as a further question,and remains silent.        SCHOOLTEACHER: I get the feeling you're hiding        something from me.         MARIE: What?        SCHOOLTEACHER: That's what I'd really like to        know.SILENCE. Then the schoolteacher turns to Martin:        SCHOOLTEACHER: When you were looking for Hansi a        while ago, what did you want from him?Short PAUSE.        MARIE : We were worried. He's ill.         SCHOOLTEACHER: I'm asking Martin.PAUSE.        MARTIN: Yes. He isn't well. And since his mother        is gone... we thought, we should go and pay him        a visit.The schoolteacher realizes that he won't get any furtherthis way.        SCHOOLTEACHER: Did you ever ask yourselves who        could have treated Hansi that way?PAUSE. Then the schoolteacher adds:        And Sigi?PAUSE.        And who tied the wire in the doctor's garden?        And who set fire to the barn?        Well?!PAUSE.        MARIE: Yes, of course we wondered.         SCHOOLTEACHER: Well?        MARIE: We discussed it with Father. He said it        must be a sick person.PAUSE. The schoolteacher doesn't know how to go on.        SCHOOLTEACHER:    Sigi   was    with    you at        Thanksgiving. And so was Hansi.PAUSE.        MARIE: I don't understand.With demonstrative helplessness she looks at theschoolteacher, then at her brother, and again at theschoolteacher: Shaking her head and shrugging hershoulders.        SCHOOLTEACHER: What did they do to you?         MARIE (doesn't seem to understand): Who?                                                           91         SCHOOLTEACHER: Sigi and Hansi?         MARIE (as above): Why?         SCHOOLTEACHER:   They    obviously   were   being         punished. For what?         MARIE (as above): I don't know.         SCHOOLTEACHER: Liesl foresaw that Hansi would be         punished? What for?         MARIE (as above): I don't know.PAUSE.         Why do you ask us?PAUSE.         SCHOOLTEACHER:   You're  an   intelligent   girl,         Marie. Don't try and play dumb.PAUSE.         MARIE: I don't understand you, Sir. You should         talk with Father about this or with Mother.         Shall I go get her?The schoolteacher looks at her.        MARIE: Martin, would you please get her?Martin gets up and is about to go to the door.        SCHOOLTEACHER: Stay here, Martin: I'll talk to        your parents when I consider it's the right        time. Now, I'm talking to you. And I expect you        tell me the truth.Martin sits down after exchanging a glance with Marieagain.        Where were you on the evening Hansi was found?         MARIE (doesn't seem to understand): At home.        SCHOOLTEACHER: I mean after the confirmation?At that moment, the pastor's wife enters with the coffeecups on a tray.        PASTOR'S WIFE: There we are. The coffee will be        ready in a minute.She puts the tray on the table. Turns to theschoolteacher, friendly as ever:        Were the children able to help you?The schoolteacher looks at Marie, then he answers:        SCHOOLTEACHER: I'm afraid not. They don't know        anything, either.         PASTOR'S WIFE: That's really odd. A doctor can't         vanish into thin air. What about his patients?                                                             92        (to the children) Didn't his daughter tell you        anything at school?The schoolteacher gets up, ready to leave.        SCHOOLTEACHER: No. I'm sorry if I disturbed you.       PASTOR'S WIFE: Why don't you stay? My husband       will be back any moment, and the coffee is       almost ready.       SCHOOLTEACHER: That's very kind of you, but I'm       really worried about the midwife's son.       PASTOR'S WIFE: And she didn't say when she'd be       back?        SCHOOLTEACHER: I didn't ask her. She caught me        off guard. She was completely panicked.The pastor's wife shakes her head thoughtfully.        PASTOR'S WIFE: Strange... Wait a second! I think        that's my husband.And indeed, outside one can hear the FRONT DOOR and thenthe STEPS of the pastor. The wife goes to the door toopen it. The pastor appears.        PASTOR (surprised to see the schoolteacher):        Good evening.       PASTOR'S WIFE: Good evening. The schoolteacher       has been anxiously waiting for you.       PASTOR (to the schoolteacher): Yes?        SCHOOLTEACHER: Yes. I'd like to have a quick        chat with you.The pastor doesn't really understand what can be sourgent, and why the schoolteacher, which was unusual forhim, came to see him in the evening. But he remainsfriendly:        PASTOR: Please. We'd better go to my study. It's        quieter there.The schoolteacher nods to the pastor's wife, who is gladthat the required meeting can now take place, while thepastor walks ahead with an inviting gesture. As thepastor opens the door of the STUDY, he asks:        PASTOR: Well, how can I help you?They enter the room and the pastor offers theschoolteacher a chair. Then he realizes that the windowsare open and closes them, as the schoolteacher starts tospeak.        SCHOOLTEACHER: I spoke to the midwife today: she        said she now knew who tortured her son.       PASTOR ("who"?): She does?                                                           93       SCHOOLTEACHER: She'll only     tell   the   police.       That's why she went to town.       PASTOR (doesn't quite understand        what    the       schoolteacher is getting at): Well?       SCHOOLTEACHER: She left the boy behind alone and       has locked the whole house.       PASTOR: Locked it?        SCHOOLTEACHER (nods): I went to the doctor's        next door to ask him what was going on, whether        he was taking care of the child or... But        there's a piece of paper saying that the        practice is closed until further notice. The        doctor and his children have disappeared.The pastor has almost finished closing the windows. Hepauses and turns to the schoolteacher:        PASTOR (stunned): What do you mean?        SCHOOLTEACHER (shrugs): I don't know. I thought        you might have been informed. That's why I'm        here.After a startled PAUSE the pastor shakes his head:        PASTOR: I have no idea.He   finishes  closing   the  windows.   Then   he  goesthoughtfully over to the schoolteacher and sits down infront of him.        PASTOR: Xenia... Wasn't his daughter in school?        SCHOOLTEACHER: Yes, she was. She never mentioned        anything.SILENCE. The pastor ponders. Then, after a while        SCHOOLTEACHER : I asked Marie and Martin. They        both know nothing either.        PASTOR   (looks   up   to    the  schoolteacher,        "stunned"): Why should they?The schoolteacher almost dodges speaking further:        SCHOOLTEACHER: I don't know. When I went to the        midwife's place, they were there with a few        others in the garden.       PASTOR ("doesn't understand"): To do what?!       SCHOOLTEACHER: They were looking for the boy.       PASTOR (as before): Why?       SCHOOLTEACHER: They wanted to help him.       PASTOR: So what                                                             94         SCHOOLTEACHER (hesitates, then says): I don't         know how to say it. I have the feeling they're         hiding something.         PASTOR (refuses): What?         SCHOOLTEACHER (keeps on searching hesitantly for         his words): I don't know. (finally he dares to         come out with his suspicion): When the doctor         had his accident... last year, you remember,         Suddenly the children were in his garden.         Supposedly, in order to help Xenia.        PASTOR (doesn't understand): Yes... and?The schoolteacher, uneasy, breathes hard. He knows thathis suspicions will seem odd, and senses that the pastorwon't go along with then.        SCHOOLTEACHER: Nothing. I had forgotten it.        Today, it came back to my mind again.         PASTOR (as before): I don't understand.PAUSE.        SCHOOLTEACHER: When they found the Baron's        son... the last time he had been seen, he was        with the children.The pastor looks at the schoolteacher, then his faceslowly freezes to a mask of refusal:        PASTOR: What are you getting at?Of course, the schoolteacher notices the reaction. Buthe has already gone too far to backtrack. After a PAUSEhe goes on:        SCHOOLTEACHER: A couple of days before Hansi was        almost beaten to death, the steward's daughter        had predicted precisely that to me. Supposedly,        she had dreamed it. The police thinks she's        lying. Who told her about it? Who announced it        to her?LONG SILENCE. Finally, the pastor gets up, takes a fewsteps, then, after another PAUSE, turns again to theschoolteacher. His face is ashen, and he can hardlyspeak:        PASTOR: If I understand you correctly, you're        saying that your pupils, my children included,        committed these crimes. Is that right?The schoolteacher has little affirmative and regretfulgesture. He feels extremely uncomfortable in this role.Another PAUSE. Then, the pastor continues:        Do you realize what you're saying?PAUSE. He breathes heavily, tries to control hisemotions.        Do you know...                                                            95His voice fails. His chin starts to shake, tears floodhis eyes, and he suddenly turns away.The schoolteacher who has been looking at him, now looksdown and stays where he is without saying a word.After a while, the pastor has regained enough control ofhimself to turn back to the schoolteacher:        I assume that I'm the first person to whom        you've uttered this monstrosity.Mute reaction of the schoolteacher ("of course").        If you ever dare to bother other people with it,        if you publicly denounce respectable families        and their children in this abject way, I shall        make sure -- and you can take my word for it --        that you will go to prison.The schoolteacher wants to reply something, but thepastor continues:        I've seen quite a lot during my work as a        pastor, but I've never come across anything as        repulsive as this.He looks at the schoolteacher for a moment with disdain:       One can tell that you have no children.       Otherwise,   you    wouldn't   stoop   to   such       viciousness. You have a sick mind. I wonder how       the school authorities could let you loose among       those poor creatures. I'll have a word with the       authorities at the proper time.       And now please leave my house. I never want to       see you here again.                            74. THE MIDWIFE'S HOUSE EXT/DAYThe steward, his wife and the schoolteacher try to breakinto the house.First the steward tries several keys. As this doesn'twork, they break down a door at the rear of the houseand go in.        NARRATOR: The midwife never came back. I waited        until the morning, two days later. Then, I went        to the manor house to inform the Baron. He        referred me to the steward and said to open the        house immediately and to look after the disabled        boy.                            75. THE MIDWIFE'S HOUSE INT/DAYBACK TO THE SCENE.                                                           96The schoolteacher, the steward and his wife searchthrough the house. Because of the closed shutters, itsrooms are veiled in half-light. Several times they call"Hansi"!, "Hello, Hansi, where are you"?, which canfaintly be heard under the narrator's voice.In the midwife's bedroom, the schoolteacher notices aphoto: it shows the doctor, an unknown woman, and Xeniaas a small girl.The boy is nowhere to be found.        NARRATOR: I had never come to the midwife's        house and felt uncomfortable at the idea of        barging into somebody else's house without        asking. It was strange, but we were still        seeking and calling out anxiously Hansi's name,        and I already knew, that we were searching in        vain. Anyone who knew the midwife also knew how        devoted she was to her disabled child, and that        she would never have left her wounded Hansi all        alone.The three searchers, who have found nothing, meet againin the stairwell.                            76. THE MIDWIFE'S HOUSE EXT/DAYThe schoolteacher, the steward and his wife come outfrom behind the house, leave the property and go theirseparate ways on the street. All that is left is theempty house with its closed shutters.       NARRATOR: During the next few weeks, the village       gossip-factory worked overtime.       Some claimed, the doctor was Hansi's father. He       and the midwife had tried to abort the child so       that the shame of their relationship wouldn't be       found out, and that's how the child became       disabled. Others even went as far as to claim       that there was something fishy about the death       of the doctor's wife, and that they wouldn't be       surprised, if the two weren't responsible for       it.                            77. MONTAGE: EXT/DAYThe houses of the doctor, the pastor, the farmer, thestreet before the school, the estate's administrativebuildings and the manor house.There is nobody to be seen.       NARRATOR: Whoever had lynched the boy obviously       knew about the hidden crimes of his parents.                                                          97       Suddenly it seemed even possible that the doctor       and the midwife, as potential murderers, were       also the perpetrators of all the other crimes.       It was suspected, that the doctor had wanted to       spare his legitimate children and himself public       disclosure of his guilt, and had therefore fled       with them. Apparently he had taken the disabled       boy with him out of guilt. Understandably       enough, he had left behind his accomplice and       the mother of the disgraced child.       The fact that it was on a bicycle that she tried       to catch up with the man who had happily       escaped, was the cause of a great deal of       laughter.The deserted estate is decorated with flags.        On July 28th Austria declared war on Serbia. It        was followed on Saturday, August 1rst, by the        German declaration of war on Russia, and on        France the following Monday.                              78.CHURCH INT/DAYHIGH ANGLE SHOT:The villagers are about to take their seats. The smallerchildren are sitting with their parents on the pews.All are in their Sunday best, the members of the militiaare in uniform. Flags are planted. Joyful excitementreigns everywhere.Once the church is full, the Baron, the Baroness andtheir son Sigi walk down the aisle and sit down in thefront row.       NARRATOR: On the Sunday between those dates, the       whole village came to the festive service.       An atmosphere of expectation and departure was       in the air. From now on nothing would be the       same.       Only a few days ago everybody would have called       the life they lived as God's will, worthy of       being lived, and would have shunned any change.       The strange joy with which the coming war was       greeted, showed that this certainty of order and       security was based on very shaky foundations.CLOSE-UPS:Of all the adult leading characters of the film, asidefrom the doctor and the midwife. Also of Eva and herfather.                                                           98       In the frenzy of patriotic enthusiasm that was       flaring up, the events that had shaken Eichwald,       had become an irrelevant.       In the face of the coming war, Eva's father had       taken his daughter back and, at her pleading,       had come to Eichwald to cast an eye at the place       where his future son-in-law was living and       working. The prospect, that I might soon call       this beloved creature my wife, turned this day       also into a solemn day for me.       The pastor never mentioned our conversation       again. Our relationship was limited to what was       required professionally. He apparently never       went through with his threat to denounce me to       the school-authorities.MORE CLOSE-UPS.The schoolteacher on the gallery lifts his hands andcues them to begin. They start SINGING. We see them oneafter the other. At the end we see Marie: she wears thewhite ribbon in her hair.       Today, more than a quarter of a century later,       toward the end of my life, and several years       after the end of a second war that was to change       this world in a more cruel and radical way than       the first one, the one we faced at the time, I       wonder if the events of those days and our       silence about them, weren't the germ of the       tragedy toward which we were heading.       Didn't we all know secretly what had happened in       our midst? Hadn't we, in a way, made it possible       by closing our eyes? Didn't we keep our mouths       shut because otherwise we would have had to       wonder if the misdeeds of these children, of our       children, weren't actually the result of what       we'd been teaching them?The image of Marie singing with the shining white ribbonfreezes.       I was drafted at the start of the third year of       the war. After the war, I sold the house in       Grundbach that I had inherited from my father,       who had died in the meantime, and with the money       I opened a tailor's shop in the town, where I       still live now.       I never saw anybody from the village again.Over the FREEZE FRAME the END CREDITS begin. Once thenarrator's VOICE has gone silent, we listen to Bach'ssolemn chorale. The children sing beautifully.
