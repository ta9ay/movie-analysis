The guy comes from data processing.PAULTerrific.  That is just terrific!  This is just terrific!SUSANYou're being paranoid Paul.SCENE 37PAULThese tests were conducted over a six month period using a double-blind format of eight over-lapping demographic groups.  Every region of the country was sampled, the focus testing showed a solid base in the 9 to 11-year old bracket--with a possible carry-over into the 12-year olds.  When you consider that Nobots and Transformers pull over 37 percent market share, and that we are targeting the same area, I think that we should see one quarter of that and that is one fifth of the total revenue from all of last year.  Any questions?  Yes?  Yes?JOSHI don't get it.PAULWhat exactly don't you get?JOSHIt turns from a building into a robot, right?PAULPrecisely.JOSHWell, what's fun about that?PAULWell, if you had read your industry breakdown, you would see that our success in the action figure area has climbed from 27 percent to 45 percent in the last two years.  There, that might help.JOSHOh.PAULYes?JOSHI still don't get it.PAULWhat?!MR. MWhat don't you get Josh?JOSHWell, there's a million robots that turn into something.

MInteresting.PAULGentlemen!MANSo the robot turns into a bug.PAULAh, gentlemen, listen...MANListen to him.  He's got a very good idea here.  The robot turns into a bug.MANThis is a great idea!JOSHDifferent sizes and things.  And...you could have them wreck something...MANA lady bug.  Transformers for girls!MR. MThis is a bug that moves....It's got all kinds of possibilities.PAULThis doesn't just happen.  This doesn't happen.  You don't just come to a meeting and say "bugs."SUSANI, uh....MR. MWell done, Josh.  Well done.SCENE 38PAULHo! Ho! Ho!  He is vicious!  SUSANHe's not vicious.PAULOh, come on Susan, don't kid yourself.  That man is a killer!SUSANAll he said was "I don't get it."PAULI don't get it!  I don't get!  I don't get!  He's going for the throat, trying to eviscerate me!  Did you see the look on Macmillan's face?!SUSANMmm Hmm.SCENE 39REALTORIt's quite a unique space.  The lines are so clean and you don't get any of that partition quality.
