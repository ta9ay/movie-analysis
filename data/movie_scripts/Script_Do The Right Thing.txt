				 DO THE RIGHT THING					    by					 Spike LeeSecond DraftMarch 1, 1988; Brooklyn, N.Y.Forty Acres and a Mule Filmworks, Inc.YA-DIG SHO-NUFFBY ANY MEANS NECESSARYWGA #45816"The greatest miracle Christianity has achieved in Americais that the black man in white Christian hands has not grownviolent.  It is a miracle that 22 million black people havenot risen up against their oppressors--in which they wouldhave been justified by all moral criteria, and even by thedemocratic tradition!  It is a miracle that a nation ofblack people has so fervently continued to believe in aturn-the-other-cheek and heaven-for-you-after-you-diephilosophy!  It is a miracle that the American Black peoplehave remained a peaceful people, while catching all thecenturies of hell that they have caught, here in white man'sheaven!  The miracle is that the white man's puppet Negro'leaders,' his preachers and the educated Negroes laden withdegrees, and others who have been allowed to wax fat offtheir black poor brothers, have been able to hold the blackmasses quiet until now."		    --THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF MALCOLM XTITLES--WHITE ON BLACK					   PLACE				 Brooklyn, New York								    CUT TO:					   TIME					  Present								    CUT TO:					  WEATHER				    Hot as shit!
