Dark blues and greens, shaftsof prismed purple.  A pale shard appears in the distance.Gliding closer, a group of tiny fish dart before the camera.We're UNDERWATER.  Arriving at the form, it finally sharpensinto focus.  It's a WOMAN'S BODY submerged in dark water,arms floating lazily at her side.  The face is obscured byflowing hair.  All that is visible is a pair of COLD, STARINGGREEN EYES, which blink closed...                                                    MORPH TO:...then open as BLUE EYES, as a DIFFERENT FACE emerges fromwater.  CLAIRE SPENCER awakens from this unsettling dream inher bathtub.  She pivots the large BRASS SHOWER HEAD (thekind that moves up and down on a pipe) off to one side,reaches toward her feet and we hear the sound of a plug beingpulled.INT.  BATHROOM - DAYA HAZY SHAPE-- accompanied by a whirring sound.A steam covered mirror is cleared with a BLOW DRYER.  Clairestarts to come into focus.  The dryer stops.  She presses thered G.F.I. button on the socket.  ZAP!  A big blue sparkshoots out.  Claire pulls her hand back...and the dryerstarts whirring again.She clears the mirror and replaces the dryer on a hook.  Sheregards herself in the mirror, and attractive, elegant-looking woman around forty.Claire traces a finger along a small but noticeable SCARabove her left eye, then slowly drops the hand to her cheek,as if confirming her existence.INT.  CLAIRE'S HOUSE - DAYClaire, now dressed, presses her face against a door,listening for the sounds of stirring from within.  Silence.She quietly pushes open the door.INT.  ROOM - DAYClaire makes her way past half-filled boxes and duffels to awindow, then pulls the curtains to reveal:A LOVELY, WOODED LAKE.  It couldn't be more picturesque.  A24' SAILBOAT is moored at the dock and an OLD STONELIGHTHOUSE sits on a point across the lake.The sunlight motivates an unconscious groan from A FIGUREstill shrouded by covers.Claire sits beside the sleeping form.  She scans the roombriefly, taking in a Greenpeace flag and a picture of atomboyish ten year-old girl at camp.She gently pulls back the covers and peers down at the sameface, now a waifish, pretty seventeen year-old, with choppedhair and tiny nose ring.  Claire leans over and inhales thesleeping scent of her only daughter, CAITLIN.  She places herhand on a cheek.  The girl's eyelids flutter softly.                     CLAIRE          Morning, beauty.Caitlin lets out a grunt and rolls over onto her belly.                     CLAIRE          Let's go.  Or we'll never leave on time.From out of the pillow comes Caitlin's voice.                     CAITLIN               (muffled)          I'm totally ready.Claire glances around at the piles of unpacked clothes.                     CLAIRE          Come on, I'll make you some waffles,          maybe we'll squeeze in a trip to the          mall.               (beat)          Caitlin...Claire gently swats at the tiny lump that is Caitlin'sbehind.                     CAITLIN          Mother...Claire stands and instinctively scoops up some clothes fromthe floor, then folds and neatly stacks them on a box.Caitlin turns her head sideways on the pillow.                     CAITLIN          You're such a morning person.Claire turns at the door.                     CLAIRE          It is unwise to heckle the keeper of the          plastic.She starts to leave.  Caitlin calls out.                     CAITLIN (O.S.)          Blueberries!Claire smiles as she closes the door behind her.INT.  HALLWAY - DAYClaire bends down to pick up one of Caitlin's socks.  Whenshe stands, something catches her eye out a window.  Shegazes down, transfixed.ANGLEThrough a stand of trees over a HIGH WOODEN FENCE, A YOUNGCOUPLE is in the midst of a heated argument next door.Claire watches as the HUSBAND, a large imposing man with anunruly shock of red hair, snarls at his wife across the hoodof their huge old Buick.  She tries to get a glimpse of thewoman, but all that's visible is THE BACK OF HER BLOND HEAD.A TAN, SINEWY ARM encircles Claire's waist.  She lets out asmall gasp as a hand closes on her breast.  It's Claire'shusband, DR. NORMAN SPENCER, nibbling gently at her neck.He's older than she, pushing fifty, with silver streaksbeginning to permeate the shaggy mop of hair that makes himlook more like a preppy rocker or a lacrosse coach than theprominent academic that he is.  Claire, however, can't takeher eyes off the scene below.                     NORMAN          They at it again?Claire nods.                     NORMAN          Christ, that's twice in...When did they          move in?                     CLAIRE          I think three...                     NORMAN          Three weeks.She continues to gaze downward.  The man leans over the hood,murmuring darkly at his wife, though for Claire and Normanthe scene is entirely silent.                     CLAIRE          What's their name?                     NORMAN          Feur, I think.  Psych department.  Figures.          They're all psychotic.Outside, Mr. Feur turns and walks toward his house.  Normanbegins, once again, to nuzzle Claire.  Her eyes close, butthen she gently demurs.                     CLAIRE          She's awake.                     NORMAN          We'll be quiet.  Quick and quiet.She turns to him.                     CLAIRE          I don't want to be either.He smiles.  A really good smile.  The lips and tongue on hisfaded T-shirt mark him as a 'Stones fan.                     NORMAN          When's she out of here?                     CLAIRE          Norman Spencer.Norman gives up.  He busses her cheek.                     NORMAN               (moving toward the stairs)          Alright.  I can't take the rejection.  I'm          going to class.                     CLAIRE          Don't.                     NORMAN          Claire, I have to show up for the--                     CLAIRE          It's Saturday.Norman stops.                     NORMAN          I knew that.  You think I didn't know          that?She smiles at him.  After a beat:                     NORMAN          It's today?                     CLAIRE               (wistfully)          Yep.They share a warm, poignant look.  He turns and moves downthe stairs.                     NORMAN               (calling over his shoulder)          We're going to have to leave by three if          we want to beat the traffic.Claire returns her gaze to the scene below as Mr. Feur sayssomething ominous to his wife, then stalks into the house.                     NORMAN (O.S.)          Claire?                     CLAIRE               (absently)          Three o'clock.ANGLEMrs. Feur drops her face into her hands.EXT.  SIDEWALK CAFE - DAYClaire peruses her "to do" list as Caitlin munches a panini.                     CLAIRE          ...and I still think we should get you          some mittens.Caitlin puts down the sandwich and regards her mother warmly.The bond between them is palpable.                     CLAIRE          Do you have a scarf?                     CAITLIN          Hey.Claire looks up from her little pad of paper.                     CLAIRE          Yes?                     CAITLIN          It's only two hours away.                     CLAIRE          I know that.                     CAITLIN          I'll come back all the time.                     CLAIRE          Of course you will.                     CAITLIN          I'm just saying, you're going to be          fine.Claire smiles.                     CLAIRE          Sweetheart, I've known this day was          coming for a long time.  I've got your          father and the garden and the new house.          You really don't have to worry.Caitlin smiles back and nods, her face betraying someconcern.  Claire takes her hand.                     CLAIRE          Really.She nods reassuringly and pulls Caitlin into an embrace.  Hereyes close.                     CAITLIN (V.O.)          Mother...EXT.  COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY - DAYClaire's frozen in the hug.                     CAITLIN               (beat)          Mom.Her eyes open.  Widen to reveal Claire, holding Caitlin onthe college campus.  The URBAN SKYLINE looms in thebackground.                     CAITLIN          I have'ta go.After a moment's hesitation, she releases her grip.  Caitlinglances over her shoulder to make sure no one's witnessedthis overt display of maternal affection.                     CAITLIN          I'll call you.Claire produces an ENVELOPE, which she presses into herdaughter's hand.  It's a book of TRAIN TICKETS.                     CLAIRE          Come home anytime.Caitlin looks at Norman.                     NORMAN          Really gonna leave me, huh?She nods.  They share a tender look.                     NORMAN          Be good.She throws her arm, briefly, tightly around his waist.  A bitoverwhelmed, he slowly brings his hand to the back ofCaitlin's head.  After a moment, she steps back...                     CAITLIN          Bye....then turns and makes her way toward the large, oldColumbia dorm.  A banner is draped across its portals whichreads:                  "WELCOME CLASS OF '04."Claire watches her daughter melt into a crowd of similarlyshaggy freshmen, smoking and talking on the front steps.  Hereyes are shining.  Norman wraps an arm around her waist asshe daps at a tear with a Kleenex.                     CLAIRE               (smiling)          I almost made it.They turn and head for the car.  Claire sneaks one last lookover her shoulder.ANGLECaitlin glancing back at Claire with an apprehensive smile.INT.  NORMAN AND CLAIRE'S ROOM - NIGHTClaire walks in from the bathroom wearing a sexy cottonnightgown.  Norman is in bed, absorbed in some notes.She gets into bed, then picks up a thick text from beside himand starts reading.  After a moment:                     NORMAN          Whatcha reading?                     CLAIRE               (reading the cover, sexy voice)          Genetic repair mechanisms in eukaryotic          organisms.

Couple of Swedish sailor cells          just gang divided a virginal cheerleader          cell.                     NORMAN               (lost in his book)          Nice.

CLAIRE          Not the focus.                     NORMAN          You know what I mean.Claire thinks for a moment.

CLAIRE          We did.There's a weighty pause.                     NORMAN          It's just us now.                     CLAIRE          I know.He kisses her.

CLAIRE          Shhh.They listen.  The sounds start to become louder.  It isclearly two people in the throes of some very vocal andsavage love making.                     NORMAN          Jesus.He walks over and closes the window.  It doesn't help.

CAITLIN'S ROOM - DAYClaire pushes open the door to Caitlin's room carrying anarmful of FOLDED LAUNDRY.  She moves quickly to the bureau,not wanting to spend much time in here, then grabs a TINYBLACK TOP from the pile, and drops it into a drawer.  She'sjust about to close it, when something catches her eye.CLAIRE'S POVShe drops the laundry and slowly pulls a tattered, oldJUILLIARD T-SHIRT with a very seventies logo from the drawer.Claire gazes around the room, which is a reliquary ofCaitlin's recently concluded childhood; PICTURES, TROPHIES,STUFFED ANIMALS.She brings the now faded T-shirt to her face and drinks inthe smells.

She gazes atother photos.-- Claire in her wedding dress, Norman beside her in a tux   with a very wide bow-tie.-- Claire and Norman in front of a UNIVERSITY BUILDING.

FRONT YARD - DAYHer face streaked with tears, Claire stumbles out into theimmaculately manicured ROSE GARDEN.The yard is surrounded by a HIGH WOODEN FENCE.  She collapsesinto a lawn chair as the tears begin to subside.  Suddenly,she hears something coming from next door.She cocks her head and attempts to make out the sound.  Itis, ironically, the sound of a WOMAN CRYING.  Claire makesher way over to the fence.  The women's sobbing becomes moreplaintive and fevered.She places her face against the prickly, vine covered fenceand tries to peer through the crack.  All she can make out isA DARK BLUE BLUR that seems to be rocking.  Claire gathersher nerve and calls out...                     CLAIRE          Hello...There's no reaction.                     CLAIRE          Mrs. Feur?The sobbing chokes down to a breathless whimpering.  The blueshape vanishes from view.                     CLAIRE          Wait a minute.  I just want--Something bumps against the fence.  Claire draws back.  Shehears heavy breathing.                     MRS. FEUR               (sniffling)          Who are you?

She sees a fleshyblur and what might be part of an eye.  There's no response,just the breathing.                     CLAIRE          Hello?                     MRS.

Don't go...Claire listens to the sound of NAKED FOOTSTEPS, followed by aLARGE FRONT DOOR swinging shut.  A CAR DOOR swings open and aMAN'S SHOES follow down the path.Claire pulls back from the crack and leans against the fenceas the door closes a second time.

CLAIRE          But what if something happens?                     NORMAN          Claire...

Norman grabs her handand kisses it.INT.  NORMAN AND CLAIRE'S ROOM - NIGHTNorman snores softly.  Claire is awakened by the continuingSTORM.  She pads out to Norman's turreted library.  Rainpelts the glass.  Her face is briefly illuminated by theLIGHTHOUSE BEAM.She hears the sound of a DOOR CLOSING and moves to get abetter view of the Feur's.  Nothing but blackness.  Just asshe's turning to go back to bed.  A LIGHTNING FLASH lights upthe night.  Claire's eyes go wide.CLAIRE'S POVIn the split second of brilliance, she sees Mr. Feur, inshirtsleeves, drenched, dragging A LARGE DUFFEL toward theopen trunk of his car.                     CLAIRE               (in a hoarse whisper)          Norman!He's dead to the world.  She calls to him again.                     CLAIRE          Norman, you have to look at this!

CLAIRE          Nothing.  There was...I thought I saw          something.                     NORMAN          Is it gone?THE BEACON illuminates the empty driveway.  She nods.                     NORMAN          Come on, let's go back to bed.Yet another bolt of lightning reveals Claire, still at thewindow.EXT.  BACKYARD - MORNINGClaire sets up a camera and tripod.  She steps back and aimsher camera.  She glances up at a large upstairs window at theFEUR'S HOUSE.  One side of the curtain seems to be pulledopen, but no one's there.Feeling self-conscious, she turns back to the camera.  Themorning sun hits the flowers just right and she SNAPS SEVERALPICTURES OF THEM against her lovely house.She glances back at the Feur's window.  The CURTAIN IS NOWCLOSED.She walks over to the fence and tries to peek through it.When this doesn't work, she drags a lawn chair over and peersacross the fence.  She can barely see over, but glimpses:A DEEP FURROW in the mud of the driveway.  Just then, a carpulls into the driveway, Claire scrambles down from herperch.EXT.

CLAIRE          And so far my day has consisted of taking          pictures of my roses for the garden club.                     JODY          Wow.  Got here just in time.

JODY          Kambucha mushroom tea...                     CLAIRE          Jody--                     JODY          It soothes heart-ache and promotes          psychic wellness.  Sela suggested I bring--                     CLAIRE          You're discussing me with your psychic?                     JODY          She's not a psychic.  Just a very          enlightened spirit.                     CLAIRE          Thanks, but I'm fine.                     JODY               (pressing it into her hand)          So you'll have some later.

I just thought          I'd stop by and see if you want to take          the boat out, say Thursday morning?                     CLAIRE          You got it.Jody grins.                     JODY          See you then.Jody drives off.  Claire walks down the driveway to her frontdoor and sees Mr. Feur staring at her from a window.  Shestarts to wave, but the curtain is drawn shut.Claire arrives at the front door and reaches out to touch thedoorknob.  She stops.  A FAINT RUSTLING can be heard fromwithin.  Claire quietly opens the door and moves into:INT.  FOYER - DAYClaire stops inside the door.  Now it sounds like WHISPERING.Two voices, tense, impassioned.  It seems to be coming fromNorman's study.

CLAIRE          Hello?The lovely circular room is completely empty.  She looksaround, puzzled.  Cooper, the family's aging lab, casuallyambles over.                     CLAIRE               (to Cooper)          Please tell me you heard that.EXT.  LAKE - DAYClaire and Cooper, out on a walk, emerge onto large rocks atthe water's edge.  Claire tosses a long stick for Cooper, whobolts out onto the LONG WOODEN DOCK.  Claire gazes at theLIGHTHOUSE across the lake and a long BRIDGE in the distance.Cooper starts BARKING and looking down into the water.Claire arrives at Cooper's side and stares down into the darkwater.                     CLAIRE          Cooper...what do you see?She looks down and sees nothing but her own reflection.After a moment, she notices a FAINT WHITE SHAPE directly inthe reflection of her face.  Cooper rumbles a low growl.  Theshape seems to be gaining definition.RRRING!Claire gasps quietly, then reaches into a pocket in hersweater and pulls out a cordless phone.                     CLAIRE               (into phone)          Hi.                     NORMAN (V.O.)

You sure?...but the shape is gone.                     NORMAN (V.O.)          Claire?                     CLAIRE          Huh?  Absolutely.  Take your time.She clicks off the phone and looks down at the calm water.INT.  WORK ROOM - NIGHTClaire sits in a small workroom at a computer.  She focusesintently on the screen.ANGLEIt's ALICE'S COMPUTER SOLITAIRE.  She flips the last card andan animated Queen of Hearts, accompanied by a series ofmusical notes, parades across the screen.                     QUEEN OF HEARTS               (on computer)          You lost!  Off with your head!Claire hits "New Game" and watches as a fresh hand of cybersolitaire is dealt.

CLAIRE          Oh.  Well, just tell her that her mother          called.  Her mother.  Thank you.  Excuse          me, how can you study with that?The noise abruptly stops.  Claire clicks off the phone andreplaces it in the sweater pocket.  She tunes the stereo to aclassical music station.INT.  WORK ROOM - NIGHTShe walks in, places the cordless phone on a BASE UNIT, thenhears a different set of musical notes from the computer.She stares at the screen, stunned.ANGLEThe game has been finished.  Cards with faces swarmchaotically across the screen with the message:  YOU WIN!                     CLAIRE          Oh.  Kay.Without warning, the radio dial rips cacophonously pastseveral stations and comes to a stop on some angry, punkishrock and roll.                     CLAIRE          Jesus...She bolts around a corner to the stereo.  The music ischaotic and deafening.  She finds Cooper growling at...noone.  She turns off the stereo.  Cooper suddenly bolts downthe hall.  She follows him.INT.  FOYER - NIGHTThe foyer's empty, but the front door is open.  Clairenervously walks out and looks around.                     CLAIRE          Cooper!POV - THE GARDENNo sign of the dog.Claire turns to go back inside.  When she touches thedoorknob, she hears the whispering again.  A fleeting shadowdraws her eye to a COAT RACK MIRROR which reflects directlyinto the study.                     CLAIRE          Hello...?!The whispering stops.INT.  NORMAN'S LAB - NIGHTClaire walks in to find Norman surrounded by several GRADSTUDENTS.  At school he's a very different man; pressed shirtand tie, hair neatly brushed back.  They're preforming someunseen procedure on a live sheep in a containment harness.She stops by the door to watch him.                     NORMAN          ...and then what...Courtney?An intense ASIAN GIRL answers.                     COURTNEY          We administer the Halothane.

Andrew from          downtown...Andrew, tall razor thin, was waiting for this.                     ANDREW          An organic, neuromuscular blocking agent,          which when administered in aerosol form          temporarily renders the subject immobile.                     NORMAN          Nothing but net.He measures out the liquid from a blue plastic bottle into anapparatus connected to an inhalation mask on the sheep.                     NORMAN          Prudence here's an old friend.He moves to the sheep's head and strokes it as he nods toCourtney who turns a valve on the apparatus.  The sheepsuddenly goes completely still.  Norman moves around andbegins a brief procedure.                     NORMAN          I try to stay on her good side because I          owe her my career and most of our grant          money.  Why else?He completes the procedure.  They look at him blankly.                     NORMAN          Always do unto others as you'd have          others do unto your ewe.Groans, laughter.  He stops Claire.                     NORMAN          That'll do it.  Write this up for Tuesday!Andrew and Amy tend to Prudence, the rest leave.  Clairemoves over to him.  They kiss.  Norman packs notes and someof the chemicals into a LEATHER CASE.                     NORMAN               (warm)          What are you doing here?                     CLAIRE          There were some noises.  I didn't want to          disturb you.She watches as the sheep slowly becomes reanimated and is ledout of the room.                     NORMAN          What do you mean?  Some noises where?                     CLAIRE          In the house.  I was scared.                     NORMAN          Did you call the police?                     CLAIRE          No.  Can you drive me home?  I'll bring you          back in the morning.                     NORMAN          Of course.He takes her arm.INT.

No.  No.                     NORMAN          You didn't?                     CLAIRE               (with a smile)          Norman, you are so funny about that.  No,          I didn't.He takes a little toke, then vanishes into the bathroom.                     NORMAN (O.S.)          Cause that would be really--She lays back on the bed.

CLAIRE          Did you call about the Feurs?                     NORMAN          Oh, right.  Yes.  Harvey says the guy's a          sweetheart.  Wouldn't hurt a fly.                     CLAIRE          Huh.Claire ponders this.  Norman turns off the light and joinsher on the bed.  He kisses her knee.

LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOONClaire sits frozen, cello between her legs, bow hovering inposition.  After an uncomfortable long pause, she touches bowto string, drawing in a breath at the power of the sound.Claire takes another deep breath, then launches into abeautiful and melancholy piece of music.  She's very, verygood.  Eyes closed.  Her body begins to sway slightly as herleft hand vibratos like butterfly wings on the neck.She reaches a difficult transition and falters.  She seemsalmost surprised.  She attacks the transition again, andagain falters.  Claire bites her lower lip and tries yetagain, this time failing completely.She sits back in the chair, despondent.  Almost as anafterthought, she sadly drags the bow across strings.  At theend of the tone, something catches her ear.  She can justmake out the HINT OF A FAINT FEMININE VOICE echoing the tone.She sits up and plays a different note, then another.  Eachtime the soft mournful voice becomes more distinct.  Finallyshe plays a sharp, higher pitched note.  The voice echoeswith a distinct, unsettling shriek.CRASH!INT.  NORMAN'S STUDY - DUSKClaire walks in and sees:INSERT-- Lying on the floor...A FRAMED NEWSPAPER PHOTOGRAPHOF NORMAN AND CLAIRE.The caption announces that he's being promoted to the"distinguished DUPONT CHAIR IN GENETICS."

A single shard ofglass is missing.  She finds it a foot away by a distinctiveknot in the wood floor.She notices a COPPER GLINT in the point of glass, but whenshe moves it, it's gone.  She places the pieces of brokenglass on the frame and stands.Out of the window directly in front of her sees:  Mr. Feur,removing a DIRT COVERED SHOVEL from his trunk.  She glancesdown at the picture, then back up at Mr. Feur, who carriesthe shovel around back.                     CLAIRE          Oh no...Claire wraps up the broken picture.

CLAIRE          I didn't want to come.                     DR. DRAYTON          Then why did you?                     CLAIRE          Because he was worried about me.                     DR. DRAYTON          Your husband?                     CLAIRE          Yes.               (beat)          I'm sure he's hoping you'll pack me full          of prozac so he can live out his life in          peace.                     DR. DRAYTON          Do you really think so?                     CLAIRE          No.There's a pause.                     DR. DRAYTON          Why is he worried?                     CLAIRE          Because, I don't know, because          sometimes...sometimes I forget          things...and ever since Caitlin left,          ever since my daughter left for school,          there've been...I fainted and...

DRAYTON          Fireball?                     CLAIRE          You're joking.He shakes his head.  She shrugs, then grabs one and pops itinto her mouth.                     DR. DRAYTON          It's hard because I'm a complete stranger          and what we're talking about is          incredibly personal.  Besides, the first          time most people come here, a part of          them is wondering if I'm gonna think          they're crazy.She sucks on the fireball and slowly nods.                     DR. DRAYTON          Don't worry, I'm required to have at          least three sessions in order to commit.Her eyes get a little wider.                     DR.

DRAYTON          I have some training at helping people          through the stressful moments in life,          one of which you may or may not be          experiencing.  If you want to get some          stuff off your chest, great.  If not...He smiles and shrugs, "no problem."  She stares at him for amoment.                     CLAIRE               (re: fireball)          These are good.                     DR. DRAYTON          Mm-hmm.She studies him for a moment.                     CLAIRE          There's a ghost in my house.He nods slightly, as if she's told him, "I have someanxiety."  Claire goes on.                     CLAIRE          She finished my solitaire game and turned          on the radio...she likes rock and roll.          Angry rock and roll.                     DR. DRAYTON          How do you know it's a she?                     CLAIRE          I saw her in the water.  Beside me.  She          was filling the bathtub.                     DR. DRAYTON          What does she look like?                     CLAIRE          Pretty.  She's a blond.                     DR. DRAYTON          Do you have any idea who she is?                     CLAIRE          Um...I'd rather not say...just yet.                     DR. DRAYTON          Fine.                     CLAIRE          What do you think I should do?He thinks for a moment, then:                     DR. DRAYTON          Try to contact her.Claire nearly swallows her fireball.                     CLAIRE          What?                     DR. DRAYTON          Try to communicate with her somehow.                     CLAIRE          You think that'll help?                     DR. DRAYTON          Can't hurt.  And I think it's important          you find out what she wants.Claire ponders this for a moment, then looks back up at him.                     CLAIRE          Are you humoring me?                     DR. DRAYTON          Nope.She seems satisfied by his sincerity.                     CLAIRE          How?                     DR. DRAYTON          I don't know.  My aunt used to use my          uncle's old pajamas and a candle.He stands.  Claire nods, then stands.  She smiles too.

I just know that          when all this was happening, I felt, some          part of me felt...alive.  Like somebody          needed me.  And the more I reached out to,          it, the fuller it became.                     DR. DRAYTON          You're saying you willed these events to          happen?

My marriage is fine.          I've had some kind of "empty-nest"          episode where I saw some things that          weren't there.  Let's deal with that.

But you should know that I'm          far less concerned with whether things          you saw "existed," than I am with why you          saw them.She takes in the ramifications of that.EXT.

CLAIRE          Jody he was lying.                     JODY          What if he was?

JODY          He's trying to put it behind him, Claire.          You should too.Norman smiles and waves.  They wave back as they arrive atthe Karman-Ghia.                     JODY          You've got a beautiful life.  And even          with this, it's always been clear that he          loves you.

NORMAN               (nearly hysterical)          I did NOT!  I did not kill anyone.  Jesus.          Claire, listen to me.  I walked in and she          was lying there dead.  I swear to you.  On          my life!  She took pills and she killed          herself in our house to destroy me!  To          destroy us!  If I hadn't stopped by here          before school, the painters would have--                     CLAIRE          I don't believe you.                     NORMAN          IT'S TRUE.

There was nothing I could do for          her.  I did...I put her in the lake.  I          rolled the car in...and I watched it sink.               (beat)          And I've lived with that image ever since.               (beat)          I couldn't just stand there while          everything-- my career, us,          everything, just washed away.

She glancesdown.CLAIRE'S POVThe necklace still in her hand.She looks up again into the mirror.  Her face goes strangelyblank and, almost mechanically, she clasps the necklace ontoher neck.Suddenly, she stares over at the CORDLESS PHONE lying on thebed for a long moment.  She walks over, picks up the phoneand looks at it.CLAIRE'S POVThe redial button.She stares at the bathroom door, then hits the button.  Tworings, then:                     VOICE               (on phone)          Directory assistance...Claire's eyes widen in terror.  She clicks off the phone,and, taking it with her, starts moving toward the door to thehall.  She keeps a steady eye trained on the bathroom.

Finally, she freezes.Norman picks up the phone and stands over her.                     NORMAN          God, how did we come to this?He picks her gently up in his arms and starts carrying herslowly up the stairs.                     NORMAN          The ghost stuff, that was impressive.CLAIRE'S POVCeiling, shapes...                     NORMAN          I figure you saw her that day in the          house and just gradually intuited the          whole damn thing.  That would be pretty          astonishing.  A passive-aggressive          masterpiece.INT.  BATHROOM - NIGHTAnd into the bathroom.                     NORMAN          Wasn't until the shower that I realized          you actually believed it.  Nearly froze to          death waiting for you.  Thought the          circuit breaker would kick back over and          I'd be toast....then she's lowered into the tub.                     NORMAN          The crazy thing is...I have never for one          moment stopped loving you.He actually wipes a tear from his eye.  He kisses her lips.We can feel her revulsion.  His face over her.                     NORMAN          Don't worry about Caitlin.  I'm sure in          some tragic way this'll bring us closer          together.He turns on the faucets, then moves out of her line ofvision.  Sound of a number being dialed.                     NORMAN (O.S.)          Hey, it's Norman.  Listen, we had a huge          blowout, so I'm going down to sleep at          the lab.  I guess you're out, but...          maybe...if you wouldn't mind stopping by          to check on her in the morning?She glances down and sees on the edge of the tub...aprescription bottle of VALIUM with her name on the label.Her eyes go wide.                     NORMAN (O.S.)          It's just...Jody, it's bad.  I've never          seen her like this...               (he trails off, choking up)          I don't really know what to do anymore.Norman, lit periodically by the sweep of the light housebeacon, squats with the phone and gazes down at her.                     NORMAN          If anything ever happened to her, I'd...               (beat)          Anyway, thanks.Claire, mute, glances frantically around.  One of her fingersbegins to flutter.                     NORMAN               (tearfully)          I'm so sorry.The tub is rapidly filling.  He checks his watch, thenreaches for the Valium.  As much from will as the drugbeginning to fade, Claire lets out a garbled cry.                     CLAIRE               (sloppy, guttural)          Mmmuh...

CLAIRE          MADISON!Norman seems unnerved that she's still clinging to her beliefin the ghost.                     NORMAN          That's a little much, don't you think?He sees the necklace on her neck.                     NORMAN          Oops.  Can't have that.He puts down the bottle of Valium, then reaches aroundClaire's neck to remove the necklace.  When his hands closeon the clasp, his face suddenly goes slack.NORMAN'S POVHis arms around MADISON'S BEAUTIFUL CORPSE.Norman explodes backwards, slamming his head into the BRASSSHOWER NOZZLE.

The water slowly descends.When it seems that her lungs must burst, her mouth finallyclears the descending water.  She chokes in great gulps ofair.The drug is finally wearing off.  Claire sits up.  Norman'sunconscious feet can be seen outside of the doorway.  Sheturns off the water and stands unsteadily.She looks around for the phone and finally spots the littleantenna protruding from under Norman.

It's empty.She spots Norman's coat hanging on the coat rack and riflesthrough the pockets.  She finds the phone, and flips it opento see if it's working.  A drop of something splats on thephone.  Then another.  It's blood.She looks up and sees Norman, his forehead gashed, glaringdown from the landing.She reaches for the door knob, but the keys and cell phone inher hand make it difficult to open.  Norman hurls himselfover the banister.  THUD!A BLOODY HAND yanks her backwards.  Claire slams into thecorner by the armoir.  Norman advances on her.  At the lastmoment, she throws her shoulder into the armoir which tumblesover on Norman.EXT.

She hears the hissing of the smashedradiator, then sees Norman, a shattered bloody mess on thefloor of the cab.She leans over to see if he's dead, hears a squeak andrealizes that the pickup, with the BATTERED SAILBOAT ANDTRAILER miraculously still attached, is rolling deeper intothe water.Before she can get the door open, the truck is halfsubmerged.  She frantically manages to lower her windowhalfway and starts to pull herself out.Her ribs have just cleared the glass when a bloody fist locksonto her ankle and yanks her inside.

Claire jerks free and scramblesout of the driver's side window as the truck sinks.Just as she's free of the window, she jerks to a stop.  Shelooks down and sees Norman, half out of the window, one handclamped onto her ankle.There is a wrenching metallic creak.  The truck lurchesdownward...then silence.  IT DOESN'T SINK.
