CLAIRE'S POWDER ROOMThere's an enormous circular bathtub and a Jacuzzi,endless mirrors, a writing desk, carpeted, a place onecould spend one's life in -- MIKE SEEN, in the MIRRORS,wandering through -- idly pushing a mirrored door open, togaze, in awe, at the walk-in closet.

Just him and a wooden deskchair, the grade-school variety.  No books, no crosswordpuzzles; he came unprepared.  He checks his watch andlooks to an ornate wall clock.  And he's bored.  He picksup an empty coffee cup, looking for a last drop.  Settlesfor sniffing it.  Replaces it on the floor beside him.Then he looks to the closed doors of the apartment andmakes a decision.  Picking up the coffee cup, he quietlypushes the DOORS OPEN, and ENTERS.                                            CUT TO:INT.  LIVING ROOM - NIGHTAs MIKE pads quietly across the marble floors in thequiet; pausing to gaze, in awe, at the vast, empty LIVINGROOM.  It is gigantic, his eyes roaming the ceilings, asthough to estimate their height.Moving inward, his eyes fall on a BOOK RACK, and hecrosses to it, perusing the shelves for possible readingmaterial.They're all ART BOOKS, the big, thick kind.  A Renoir,because of a NUDE FIGURE on the cover, catches his eye.But as he pulls it out and begins to leaf through -- heHEARS VOICES.

ELLIE                  (joking)          No, I don't want the 'fuckin'" tie          -- I'm sorry --                  (conciliatory)          I'm glad she bought you a tie.  You          needed one.  You look good in that          tie.                  (a beat)          Next time you two go shopping, maybe          you could tell her we need a new          Maytag stackable, double-decker          washer and dryer set.MIKE smiles, she gives him a kiss, and a flick on thenose.

Just checking to see if you're          here.                         MIKE          I came on at 8:00.An awkward silence.                         MIKE          You all right?                         CLAIRE          Yeah.                         MIKE          I'm sorry about what happened.                         CLAIRE          Listen, that was my fault.                         MIKE                  (disagreeing)          I shouldn't have listened to you, I          should've followed you right into          the "can" the way he did.                         CLAIRE          If I had known I was going to have          company, he was right next to me.  I          think he heard me peeing!  I hate          that, I am glad he's in jail.She laughs, he smiles, both attempting to make light ofit.  But it's hard to make light of; the attempt quicklyfades.                         CLAIRE          Lieutenant Garber says when I          identify him, they're going to lock          him up and throw away the key.MIKE nods; buttoning his lip.                         CLAIRE          I guess I'm supposed to do it in the          morning.  Identify him.                         MIKE                  (uneasy)          Sooner, the better.

How could he do that if he's          in jail and they've thrown away the          key...?MIKE is TORN.                         MIKE          It's the right thing to do.

KOONTZ                  (re: the sirens)          Told you they'd be here in a few          minutes.The grim humor of it is registered in SILENCE.  MIKE picksup VENZA'S HUNTING KNIFE from the floor, cutting throughthe ropes that bind TOMMY'S and ELLIE'S HANDS; she PULLSTOMMY to HER, in a tearful EMBRACE, shielding his facefrom the ghastly sight of the man, lying dead, on thefloor.OTHER PEOPLE are MOVING INWARD, CLAIRE among them, clad inan OVERSIZED POLICE OVERCOAT -- looking frail andfrightened, SHUDDERING WITH RELIEF when she sees that allare safe.  But there is no mistaking the presence ofsomething else in her eyes.CLOSE ON CLAIRE'S FACE:  gazing at MIKE, his familywrapped in his protective embrace.  He LOOKS UP, meetingher eyes.                         CLAIRE          Everyone's all right...?                         MIKE          Yeah.  It's all over.LONG ANGLE on the ROOM:  dimly illuminated by the singlelight, shed from the opened refrigerator door, as peoplebegin to move -- awakening to life, and its necessarydetails, in the aftermath of the crisis.                                            CUT TO:EXT.  THE HOUSE - SAMEThe LAWN virtually FILLED with POLICE VEHICLES, theirrevolving red lights illuminating the grim scene; a smallgathering of onlookers gawking from behind police ropes,AMBULANCES pulling SLOWLY, SILENTLY, away.CAMERA PANS to two figures ALONE, beside a squad car, inthe distant shadows.  It's CLAIRE, still clad in thepolice overcoat, and MIKE.  They are together, butseparate, maintaining the proper distance to say goodbye.CLOSER ANGLE ON THEM:  not knowing quite what to say.                         MIKE          So.                         CLAIRE          So.ANGLE ON BOTH:  their eyes locked into each other's.                         MIKE          You still going away?                         CLAIRE          I don't know...                         MIKE          You don't have to, now.                         CLAIRE          I think it's probably still a good          idea.CLOSE ON MIKE:  getting her message.                         MIKE          Yeah...Both are hurting.                         CLAIRE                  (heartfelt)          I'll miss you, Mike.                         MIKE          Listen, I'll... see you again.Her eyes are glistening; she gives him a bracing smile.But he can't quiet manage it.                         CLAIRE                  (barely able to                   speak)          Say goodbye.He struggles with it; unable.                         MIKE          I like your coat.                         CLAIRE                  (half-laugh, half-cry)          You have a weakness for Lady Cops.                         MIKE          I do.Silence now; their eyes adoring.                         CLAIRE          Say goodbye, Mike.                         MIKE                  (thick voiced)          You take care.MIKE TURNS -- CAMERA MOVING WITH HIM as he WALKS SLOWLYAWAY -- finding himself on a collision course with GARBER.They meet, spending a long moment in non-communicativegreeting.                         MIKE                  (finally)          What do you think?                  (a beat)          Any chance?  There's nothin' else          I'm any good at, but this.                         GARBER                  (noncommittal)          Call me next week.  We'll talk about          it.MIKE absorbs it, looking up to SEE ELLIE and TOMMY, besidea SQUAD CAR, a distance away.  Girding himself, he HEADSTOWARD.ANGLE ON ELLIE AND TOMMY -- as he APPROACHES, and standsbeside them.  Not much to say.  Finally he reaches out andtousles TOMMY'S hair.                         MIKE          Good police work, kiddo.He catches ELLIE'S eye, both assessing each other.                         ELLIE                  (re: Tommy)          He doesn't want to sleep here.                  (a long beat)          Neither do I.  It's not my house          anymore.                         MIKE          Me neither.ANGLE ON ALL:  finding each other's eyes.                         MIKE          Let's find some place to start over.MIKE puts an arm AROUND TOMMY -- and the CAMERA BEGINS ALONG PULLBACK, as ELLIE moves to his side, and the KEEGANFAMILY begins to MOVE AWAY.  WE SEE CLAIRE, being helpedinto a SQUAD CAR, turning to look back at them as it PULLSAWAY -- CARS REVVING UP and PULLING OUT, in ALLDIRECTIONS.From a distance, we HEAR MIKE'S VOICE.                         MIKE (V.O.)                  (to Ellie)          What this crap about singing          lessons?                                            FADE OUT.                         THE END
