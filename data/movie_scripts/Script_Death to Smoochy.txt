DIMLY-LIT BAR - NIGHTA suburban-looking HUSBAND and WIFE enter. They findRainbow Randolph sitting alone, drinking a Scotch. Hairslicked back, sans bow tie, the friendly face no longerlooks so friendly. He nods for them to sit down. Aftera nervous beat, the Husband puts a briefcase on the tableand slides it to Randolph. Randolph takes a gulp of hisScotch. He unsnaps the briefcase and opens it. Fivegrand stares him in the face.                     HUSBAND             So... uh... you'll make sure my             boy dances up front, right? Where             he'll get the most camera time?Randolph slams the briefcase shut, startling the couple.

STOKES             (addressing the brass)          Gentlemen, let me be the first to          say, in all sobriety, that I'm as          shocked and outraged as all of --The network CEO, a hog of a man, cuts him off.                  CEO          Save it for the papers, Stokes.          We've got nervous sponsors and an          angry public -- a combination          uglier than two monkeys fucking.          What are you doing about it?                  STOKES          Well, sir, I'm currently in the          process of compiling a list of          viable replacements and it's my          hope...                  CEO          Clean replacements?    With          background checks? I assure you,          Mr. Stokes, this network cannot          survive another Rainbow Randolph.          The goddamn P.R. department looks          like the Jim Jones camp.Another EXECUTIVE chimes in.                  EXECUTIVE #1          Remember, Stokes, this was your          dog that crapped on our rug.                        EXECUTIVE #2          We trusted you, Frank. And now          we're in a tight spot. We have to          post our quarterly earnings next          month, for Christ's sake.                   CEO          Whoever takes that slot has to be          a straight arrow. Clean as a          whistle.                  EXECUTIVE #3          Right. Someone who'll take the          heat off. One of those sweater          types.

EXECUTIVE #1             No way. The idea now is to stop             the hemorrhaging.                           EXECUTIVE #2             You better fix this, Stokes. Get             us a white bread replacement,             fast. Bland, milk toast. Not a             speck of controversy.A giant hand slams on the table. All heads snap.The CEO drags his fingers along the shiny mahogany.Deafening sound.                     CEO                (calm and measured)             Squeaky fucking clean.INT.

If I ever see             that Rainbow Randolph again I'll             strangle him. Choke the life out             of him. Squeeze his scrawny neck             until his eyes pop out of his             skull and bounce off the walls...                     STOKES             Before indulging such cheery             fantasies, let's just concentrate             on saving my job. Shall we?                     NORA             Sorry, Frank.Stokes flips through a thick stack of files.      He suddenlystops at one.                     STOKES             What's going on with Sheldon Mopes             these days.Nora laughs.                     NORA             Oh my God. Have we sunk to that             level already? Smoochy the Rhino?             What a sap.                     STOKES             Sap's just the pill we need right             now. Mopes is a straight arrow.             Always has been.                     NORA             The guy can't get arrested, Frank.             He can't even break into the             birthday party circuit. Last I             heard he was working hospitals and             nursing homes. He's a joke.Stokes stands up and walks around the room.                     STOKES             The truth of the matter is, a             successful children's show has             always depended on two simple             elements: a fuzzy costume and a             lot of hype. Strip away the foam             rubber and the network money and             they're all jokes. Marginal             talents.. cabaret acts... off-             Broadway runoff...

STOKES             And each one a moral question             mark. Something I can't risk at             the moment.                     NORA                (frustrated)             We can do better than this guy,             Frank. He brings nothing to the             table.                     STOKES             Except ethics. With Mopes,             there's never been a whiff of             controversy. The man's an             ethical, harmless, cornball. In             short, a glass of milk on two             legs.Stokes stops pacing.                     NORA             Don't ask me to do it. You know             I'll do anything for you, but             please... not this...Stokes gazes out the window at the city.                     STOKES             Go find Smoochy.EXT.

We CONTINUE DOWN anarrow hallway as the faint sound of someone SINGING andplaying the GUITAR INCREASES. We finally burst THROUGHanother set of doors marked "Treatment Room." Thesinging now fills our ears as we PUSH IN ON the"performer" -- a big, puffy, orange rhinoceros. Smoochy.Or to be more specific, SHELDON MOPES.

He's in it to make Frank Stokes          rich. That's how these network          goons operate.                  SHELDON          That's so sad. Is it just me, or          is that sad?                  BURKE          You know, years ago, a client of          mine, Dicky Gimble, was having a          problem...                  SHELDON          Wow, you represented Dicky Gimble?                  BURKE          Yeah, before the asshole found          religion. Anyway, Stokes was          trying to screw my boy out of some          merchandising points. Claimed he          had a warehouse full of Dicky          dolls that weren't moving. Now          Frank and I are old friends, so I          say to him, 'Okay, cock, show me          the warehouse' -- see, I know the          fucking warehouse is in the Bronx,          and I know it's emptier than my          wife's head.             (chuckles)          To make a long story short, I walk          out with a check for a hundred          grand and Stokes is sitting there          with his thumb up his ass.Burke laughs.                  SHELDON          That's very amusing, but I don't          care about Smoochy dolls and          Smoochy floor wax... I just want          more creative input. This rhino          came from my womb. I bore him, I          nursed him, and dammit...He pounds his fist on the table.

BURKE             Shel, it's all about the dough.             After you get the money, you get             the power. And after you get the             power, you can have Smoochy walk             on stage with a hard-on if you             want.                     SHELDON             It's funny, that never crossed my             mind.Burke downs the rest of his drink and stands up.

SHELDON             I've never owned a gun, I've never             touched a gun, and I don't believe             in guns.

SPINNER                (a little angry)             I ain't no baby!                     SHELDON             That's right. You're a fully             grown man. With whiskers... and             scars... the whole sha-bang.             That's why you deserve a bigger             role on the show. A more             important role...Spinner's face starts to perk up.                                                      84.INT. STUDIO C - SHORT WHILE LATERIt's the middle of a Smoochy taping. Smoochy and theGang are wrapping up a song entitled, "My Stepdad's NotMean (He's Just Adjusting.)" The kids in the bleachersare singing the chorus.                        KIDS          'Stepdads are people too/ They          have bad days, like we all do/          Be patient and help them through/          Stepdads are people too...'Smoochy continues the song.                       SMOOCHY             (singing)          ... 'So three cheers for the man          that I proudly call Stan... He's          not quite a dad or a brother...          Yes, he gets cross, but still he's          the boss... And besides he takes          care of my mother!'The song ends. The kids in the bleachers applaud.Smoochy addresses them.                  SMOOCHY          Remember, kids. First          impressions, good or bad, are not          always what they seem. Just like          a new puppy, new dads need to          adjust to their surroundings. So          give 'em time! But always          remember... if he becomes abusive          to you or Mommy... what are the          magic numbers?

You wanna say howdy to             the kids?Spinner freezes.       He stares at the camera.                       SMOOCHY             Moochy?                     SPINNER             My name is Moochy.                     SMOOCHY             That's right. We've established             that.

Smoochy, Moochy and a fewother jungle animals begin to dance. Moochy's lumberingmovements are in stark contrast to the choreographedsteps of the others. As a bonus, he occasionallyscratches his crotch.INT. SHELDON'S DRESSING ROOM - AFTER THE SHOWA happy Spinner (still in costume as Moochy) pokes hishead into Sheldon's dressing room. Sheldon, still incostume as well, looks drained after the difficulttaping.                     SPINNER             That was fun! Was it bad when I             done that thing, where I tripped             and knocked over the Flamingo and             then he knocked over the cameraman             and then those lights fell down on             that lady's head?

Like a guy who's come             back from the war.
