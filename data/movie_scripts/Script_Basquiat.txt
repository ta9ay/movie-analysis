BLACKWe HEAR "Waltzing Matilde," by Tom Waits.INT. MUSEUM OF MODERN ART - DAY (DREAM SEQUENCE IN GRAINY BLACKAND WHITE)Fade out music.Silence.A well-dressed black BOY and his MOTHER walk through severalgalleries.They stand before Picasso's "Guernica," holding hands.The mother is disturbed. Crying.The boy looks up, confused and frightened, concerned to see hismother crying in public. She looks at him tenderly.Her brow furrows. She stops crying. She stares just above hiseyes.Something's happening: she looks with wonder at the top of hishead... his eyes roll upward, trying to see - it's a crown!He raises his hands. He touches it.A beam of light illuminates the crown, casting its glow on hismother's face.The beam gets whiter, the rest of the screen gets black.INT. CARDBOARD BOXSilence. In darkness, we hear a VOICE - imbued with a sense ofits own history:                      VOICE (O.S.)           Everybody wants to get on the Van Gogh           boat. There's no trip so horrible that           someone won't take it. The idea of the           unrecognized genius slaving away in a           garret is a deliciously foolish one. We           must credit the life of Vincent Van Gogh           for really sending this myth into orbit.           How many pictures did he sell? One? He           couldn't give them away. We are so ashamed           of his life that the rest of art history           will be retribution for Van Gogh's neglect.           No one wants to be part of a generation           that ignores another Van Gogh.The beam of light shines through a small hole. It falls upon asleeping, dreaming, delighted face. It belongs to JEAN MICHELBASQUIAT.OUTDOOR, DAYTIME SOUNDS filter in.Hearing the voice, Jean frowns at being woken up.EXT. TOMPKINS SQUARE PARK - DAYA long, rectangular cardboard box.SUPER: "NEW YORK CITY"ANGLE ON:RENE RICARD (early 30's), seated at a park bench, hunched over anotebook. He's a raggedy dandy: A poet in a hooded sweatshirt andwhite hightops.As he writes, he reads aloud, as if addressing Posterity.                        RENE (CONT'D)                   (sighing theatrically)            In this town one is at the mercy of the            recognition factor. One's public            appearance is absolute.Beyond him, a HAND gropes its way out of the box. It tosses a canof YOOHOO chocolate drink.                       RENE (CONT'D)            I consider myself a metaphor of the public.            I am a public eye. I am a witness.A HEAD appears from the box. It's Jean's.Jean sees the start of a crisp, colorful autumn day. The urbanpark around him is alive with a typically full range of the goodand bad in life. He eases himself out of the oversize box inwhich he has spent the night. There's something about the waythat he stands while waking up that suggests he's almostsurprised at his own body, the adultness of his limbs - just asubtle hint of him coming out of a dream.He squints in the sunlight. He has a soft, gentle, Haitian face.His hair is pulled tight to his head. He wears two pairs of bluejeans (one cut like chaps over the other) a paint-coveredWesleyan University T-shirt, and the inside lining of anovercoat. His appearance is unruly, but it's deliberate. He'sstylish.He shakes himself off and collects his stuff, which includes: asmall book of Pontormo drawings, a can of black spray paint. anda cigar box made into a loudspeaker with pencil holes and maskingtape.Jean walks out of the park and looks up past the buildings at thesky:SUPERIMPOSED IN THE SKY - STOCK FOOTAGE OF A HAWAIIAN SURFERJean sees the surfer, 'riding the nose' in glistening, shimmeringsunlight.

Hespraypaints: "SAMO AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO GOD"                        RENE (CONT'D, O.S.)            When you first see a new picture, you don't            want to miss the boat. You have to be very            careful because you may be staring at Van            Gogh's ear.Jean signs his words with his 'logo', a triple pointed crown.As he presses the spray can, we HEAR the roar of a breaker.

He fixateson her.She looks up and notices his stare. She continues to work.Still staring at her, he sits down at a table. He pours maplesyrup onto the table. He draws in the syrup with his fingers.CLOSE ON SYRUP ON TABLEANOTHER WAITRESS arrives at his table. She's put off by thesyrup.                      WAITRESS           What'll it be?Jean thinks about it, eyes still following Gina.                       BASQUIAT           Ummm. It'll be great. We'll live together           in peace. What's her name?                  (indicates Gina)He looks up at the waitress.                      WAITRESS           Gina. What'll it be?                       BASQUIAT           Pancakes.She leaves and whispers something to Gina. Gina turns and glancesover at Jean.Jean pours more syrup and starts writing his name.At the grill, LESHKO, the burly Owner/Cook, has his watchful eyeon Jean. He doesn't like what he sees.Jean smears the syrup thinly, so it doesn't erase itself. Hedraws a picture of Gina, using his fingers and the silverware,rendering her last expression strikingly with a few quick lines.A GAUNT YOUNG MAN saunters up to Jean's table. He's sort of atall Puerto Rican Alain Delon with sleepy eyes. He is BENNY.                      BENNY           Hey - Willie Mays.

Look at you, staring at this girl,           making a mess.He waves Jean toward the door.Jean takes Gina's rag and begins cleaning his mess, seeminglycompliant.                      BASQUIAT           How about those pancakes?He brings out a roll of dimes to the tabletop and splits it open.Dimes roll all over the table and stick in the syrupy parts.

He carries a plate of cookies and a full glassof milk.He approaches a sad, nice-looking, middle-aged black woman - thesame one from the dream, earlier. She sits alone fondling apillow in her lap. It's his mother, MATILDE. She doesn't see himcoming.As he sets the plate in front of her, she notices him. Sherecognizes him and seems pleased, even in her isolation.

Rain forces his blinking eyes open.INT. BENNY'S APARTMENT -     NIGHTA door opens to reveal Jean's wet face.Benny lets him in.Jean enters a rundown railroad flat crammed with musicalinstruments, beer cans, and homemade art. There's a couch with asheet over it.Junk is piled in a corner - mostly art books and drawings.Benny sits down at an electric piano, which he's evidentlyplaying. He sings along, softly, working out the words,concentrating, absorbed.Jean sets his belongings on the couch, walks to a mic stand andstarts making up his own words.

Finally, he finds what he'slooking for - a pile of "SAMO baseball cards" - color Xeroxes ofhis favorite images and words. He pockets them.

She said she wanted to be by           my side and have inter-racial babies with           me.Benny grins. He grabs a basketball and spins it expertly on hisindex finger.                      BENNY           G'night... See you in court tomorrow.Jean turns on the TV. He notices the roach. He picks up the paperBenny gave him with the message from his father and sets it onfire.He lights the roach with it.He looks up; on television, we see a BUM being interviewed. Jeanturns up the volume.The bum's on the ground, looking beat up. Jean picks up a pocketrecorder and turns it on:                      BUM           The guy just hit me and I was on the           ground!!!! Boom, for real.Jean mutes the sound on the TV. He rewinds and proudly plays backthe words "Boom, for real."He picks up the phone and dials. He turns on the speakerphone.Jean holds the recorder to the speaker as someone answers thephone.

French?Jean sits in a chair onstage with his band members. Benny playsthe organ. The other band members play percussion and guitar.It works. The crowd loves it.The song ends abruptly.We begin to hear James Brown's "Sex Machine."Jean looks out into the crowd and notices Gina. She's lookingright back at him from the bar. Pleased to see her face, he saysto himself -                      BASQUIAT           Boom, for real.We see him walk offstage into the crowd. They meet.                      BASQUIAT (CONT'D)           I thought you hated this place?                         GINA           I do.                  (beat)           I just said that. I was never here before.

(Music: REGGAE SONG - ErrolScorcher's "Cockroach in de Corner.")EXTREME CLOSEUPA cockroach crawls from Gina's bedroom across the floor and intothe kitchen where Jean sits naked on the floor, working on adrawing. It crawls over his drawing towards a cardboard box.Jean rummages through a cabinet. He finds a can of bugspray. Jeantears off a side of the box. With cardboard in one hand andbugspray in the other, he forgets the cockroach.He's mesmerized by the list of ingredients on the aerosol can.Someone POUNDS furiously at the door.Ignoring the pounding, he starts listing the ingredients on thepiece of cardboard, finishing his new drawing by including asymbol of a cockroach to the left of the list.                      LANDLADY           Miss Cardinale... Open up for me, please!He gets up and peeks through the security hole. He sees a middle-aged Hispanic woman reaching to unlock the door. He opens it.                      LANDLADY (CONT'D)           Ohhh, Dios mio!She stares at him levelly.                      LANDLADY (CONT'D)           I just want the rent.

It's a a little shack with a big headnext to it that says "'Here' For Rent."The landlady looks at him like he's crazy. She balls up thedrawing and puts it in her pocket.Gina arrives in the doorway, wearing a robe. The landlady'strapped between them.                       GINA                  (to Jean)           What're you doing?The landlady wags her finger at Gina.

GINA           A friend of mine offered me a job doing a           little work installing a show in a gallery.           He's an electrician. I was supposed to be           there an hour ago.She looks at the bugspray drawing on the floor.

MARY BOONE GALLERY - DAYWhite dust sprinkles down onto Jean's face from the ceiling.Unable to use his hands, he tries to blow the dust out of hiseyes...His boss, GREG, a mild-mannered hippie electrician, works abovehim on the ladder. Jean steadies the ladder. Greg's head is outof frame.The gallery is an impressive space under preparations for anopening.

GREG              Yeah.Jean shakes his head and puts it back. He tries a couple more -they each say "CRAFTSMAN." He puts them back.Finally, he finds one with a different handle. It says "G.S.C.2000."                         BASQUIAT              You don't have any!!!                         GREG              That's impossible.

(demonstrating)              See, this is a regular screwdriver, and              this is a Phillips head. The cross thing...              I'll tell you later what all the tools are              so you'll know.A GROUP of people arrives.Albert Milo    comes into view, tailed closely by Rene Ricard andMARY BOONE    - well dressed, petite, intense, 30. Milo, (also about30), wears    casual clothes splattered with paint. Mary Boone isengaged in    conversation with Milo. Rene chatters away.Greg climbs back up the ladder. He holds a piece of wire down toJean. Jean stares at the group while trying to be invisible.                         RENE              I need to make a call, Mary. You don't              mind, do you?                         MARY BOONE              Certainly not. You can use my line.Rene picks up the phone.                          RENE              To Paris.

GREG           Jean? Hold this, please.                  (beat - he sees why Jean's so                  distracted)           You'll get there. But it's good to have           something to fall back on. That's why I           became an electrician. It pays the rent.           Y'know, I'm an artist, too.                      BASQUIAT           I didn't know.                      GREG           I sculpt. I'm really just starting to find           myself. How old are you? Twenty? You're           just like I used to be. I'm forty-one. And           I'm glad I haven't gotten any recognition.           It gave me time to develop.Jean watches Mary and Milo talking.                       MARY BOONE                  (to Milo)           I can't tell you how happy I am with this           show.Mary yells across the room to Jean.

Would           you move those tools there and put them           somewhere else?He looks at her.Milo watches to see what he's going to do.

BOONE GALLERY - ALBERT MILO OPENING - DUSKThe ART WORLD CROWD fills the gallery. Jean lurks across thestreet, watching through the window.Cabs and limousines line the block. A crowd outside blocks thestreet.Jean's obviously impressed, jealous and estranged -     he feelsentitled to all this.He crosses the street to get a closer look.THROUGH THE WINDOWHe sees Albert Milo    talking with ANDY WARHOL and BRUNOBISCHOFBERGER. Andy,    of course, is thin, silver-haired, andnearly albino. Bruno    is a Swiss art dealer in his 40's.

It flies up, up, up -     and over the backboard.He runs after the ball, gets it, and dribbles clumsily.                      BENNY           You're shattering all my myths.

The same kinda           work, the same style - over and over           again, so people recognize it and don't get           confused. Then, once you're famous, you           have to keep doing it the same way, even           after it's boring - unless you want people           to really get mad at you - which they will           anyway.Benny tosses Jean the ball.

Then one day they           invented a machine to do it. And he says           "Fuck that, I'm a MAN" and he challenges           the machine to a race to lay down a mile of           track. It takes two days. Neck and neck the           whole time. They get right to the end, and           he beats it by one spike.                  (pause)           Got a cigarette?

Little home, farewell,           The broken windows           and the bodega on the corner.           Now from my balcony           I look out over all New York...INT.

GINA'S APARTMENT - DAYJean watches "The Little Rascals" on TV in the living room. Thesound is turned off and a record player PLAYS Gypsy music loudly.Rolled up in a large drop cloth, Gina is asleep on the floor.Next to her, Jean works on all fours, drawing figures, crowns,and houses.Working feverishly, he writes "HEY, HEY, HEY" in big clusters,then writes other words: SHARK, IMMORTALITY, JOHN THE REVELATOR,FAME, INK, TEETH, HAWAII SUPERMARKET, POLE STAR, BABOON and TAR.He has an acoustics manual and Bible open    on the floor. He copiesthe technical blueprints from the manual.    He reads the Bible,following the text with a dirty finger. It    seems that he watchesTV, draws, listens to the music and reads    at the same time.He mixes Liquitex paints and puts some colors on the drawings. Hedraws a long blue line and carries it over onto the floor. Up thewall. Through the fridge. Across the window.He takes off his paint-covered clothes and changes into Gina'sblack slip. He rummages around the room, gathering pieces of hisand Gina's clothes.He spreads the clothes on the floor, and selecting wide brusheswith long bristles, picks up the cans of Liquitex paint.When paint spills on the clothes, he spreads it into shapes.Gina wakes up. She reaches for one of the painted shirts.                       GINA                  (in disbelief)           Basquiat, those are my best clothes!!!

GINA           I'm going to my parents this weekend. What           am I going to wear?                  (she begins to cry)           How could you do that to me?Jean wipes his hands off on his thighs and puts his arms aroundGina, holding her.                      BASQUIAT           ... I'll buy you some new ones.                      GINA           You don't have any fucking money..Jean lets her cry for a moment, then notices the music playing onthe stereo - a Gypsy song sung in Spanish.                      BASQUIAT           Do you know what he's saying?                      GINA           What who's saying?                       BASQUIAT           Manzanita....

BASQUIAT (CONT'D)           'Even though you were never mine           And you never will be           You have a piece of my heart           You have, you have, you have...'

She walks to the bedroom. Benny watches her.                      BASQUIAT           Gina, don't you want any of this? You could           use some.Gina doesn't respond.

GINA'S APARTMENT - LATERKneeling on the floor,    Jean    covers the surface    of therefrigerator door with    fast,    rushing strokes.    He mixes paint in alarge soupbowl and dips    his    hair in the bowl.    Pressing his headto the door, he paints    with    his hair. He stops    to examine themarks.He HITS his head against the door harder and harder.                                                           FADE TO WHITEINT.

She lifts his head, revealing hispainted hair.She shakes him harder. His body is totally limp.The whites of his eyes are red; his pupils slowly float up,vanishing.                         GINA              Jean, what did you do to yourself?She listens to his breath, then to his heart.                          GINA                  (panicking)           Jesus Christ!She finds heroin sprinkled into some pot on the floor near him.                       GINA                  (slapping his face)           Don't do this to me.She shakes him until his eyes unglue. His pupils float into theirproper place.                      BASQUIAT           ... What's the matter?                       GINA                  (furious)           Oh, God, Basquiat, you scared the shit out           of me. How the fuck could you do that to           yourself?                      BASQUIAT           You're back.                      GINA           It's Monday morning.

I had to go see my           family.                      BASQUIAT           I'm your family.                      GINA           Basquiat, what did you take?Jean tries to pick himself up from the floor. He gets up stiffly,like Pinnocchio. The long sleep made his limbs wooden.                      BASQUIAT           Nothing special - just some weed.He finds an old joint and lights it up.                       GINA           Basquiat, don't lie.                  (holds up powder)           This is smack.                      BASQUIAT           You want some?He offers her the joint.EXT. ST. MARK'S PLACE - NIGHTJean and Benny walk along, sharing a beer in a brown paper bag.They approach a DRUG DEALER and exchange money for dope.Jean finds a discarded window frame in a pile of trash andcarries it with him.They sit down on a stoop. Jean rolls up a dollar bill, emptiesthe dope onto the window, and splits it into two lines. He handsthe rolled up bill to Benny, who snorts the line.Benny shakes his head involuntarily, making a violent face, asthough the dope burned a hole in his sinus.                        BENNY             We got beat.                         BASQUIAT             For real?Jean takes a taste with his finger... He tastes his tongue andmakes a face..He snorts part of his line, anyway, to make sure.He frowns.They continue onwards. Jean still carries the window.                        BENNY             You gonna carry that around all night?                        BASQUIAT             Yeah... I'll paint on it.INT. PARTY - NIGHTThe party's winding down - hip-hop kids, Lower East Side types.Jean and Benny pass through the room, ignoring the two or threeclusters of people - maybe fifteen in all...Jean encounters a familiar face: an enormous red-haired dealer -ROCKETS (35). They greet each other as friends.Rockets leads Jean aside. They stand near a wall where a paintinghangs ("Flats Fixed"). It bears Jean's three-point crown.                        ROCKETS             You did that, didn't you?Jean shrugs.                         BASQUIAT             I gave it to Maripol. She let me stay here             for awhile.Jean hands him twenty dollars. Rockets hands him two dime bags.As if thinking better, he hands the bill back to Jean.                       ROCKETS            Do one for me and it's free. How's that?Jean re-pockets his money. He gestures to Rockets as if to say"fine - it's a deal."He and Benny sit down across the room and split a bag onto thewindow, as before. This time, it's good. They lean back into it,slumping down into the couch.Nearby, Rene sits on a couch with THREE STREET KIDS - artists(who we've seen at Milo's opening). They sit on their kneeslooking out a window passing binoculars back and forth.ARTIST #1 looks through the window with a pair of BINOCULARS. Hepoints down towards the street, trying to get Rene's attention.                       ARTIST #1            Check this out, Rene.Rene lunges towards the window.

Come here, man!                      RENE           I gotta go pee.Rene weaves across the room. Suddenly, he stops cold. He'sstaring at Jean's painting. He doesn't move.                       RENE (CONT'D)                  (to himself)           Who did this?                  (beat - louder)           Who did this?                      ARTIST #2           I don't know.

It's him!Rene grabs binoculars.BINOCULARS POV:Jean pauses before one of his own graffiti pieces:"PLUSH SAFE, HE THINK"Rene watches in awe.

ANNINA NOSEI           Well, I don't want to get mugged on a           Bowery street corner. Maybe I could find a           place for you to work. Take my card.                      BASQUIAT           You want a drink?He produces a pint bottle in a paper sack.                       ANNINA NOSEI           No thanks.

Jean's           been in her gallery a thousand times.                  (to Jean)           You slut. How do you know Bruno           Bischofberger?                  (to Gina)           He's only the biggest art dealer in Europe.                      BASQUIAT           I had lunch with him once.INT. GINA'S APARTMENT (BEDROOM) - NIGHTJean and Gina lay in bed.                       BASQUIAT            Which island of Hawaii do you want our            house to be on? Maui? Kaui? Molokai?                        GINA                   (a little upset)            I hadn't thought about it.                        BASQUIAT                   (in perfect Hawaiian)            Oahu, Lanai, Niihau, Kahoolawee -                       GINA            Staten Island would be ok.Beat. Silence.Jean can't sleep. He stares at the ceiling.                       BASQUIAT            Do you wanna marry me?Beat.No reply.Gina's asleep.INT. GINA'S APARTMENT (KITCHEN) - LATER (NIGHT)Quietly, Jean kneels on the floor of the kitchen. He paints on anold window.He draws figures of three people sitting at a table - obviously afamily. He crosses out one person and paints a dog under thetable.He crosses everything out.He mixes the paint in a large bowl and starts again.Again, he crosses everything out.INT - GINA'S APARTMENT - MORNINGJean continues to work. He's wearing pajamas and a bathrobe.Gina enters, waking up.She looks at the painting.                       GINA            Kind of a family portrait.Jean moves to add something. She stops him.                       GINA (CONT'D)            It looks done.                           BASQUIAT             Think so?He pauses.                           BASQUIAT (CONT'D)             ... babies.                        GINA             You mean babies with you?                        BASQUIAT             What's wrong with me?                        GINA             You're your own baby.Jean paints out the image.There's a KNOCK at the door.                           GINA             Who is it?

Gina goes to thedoor, unlocks the chain, and looks out.                         GINA (CONT'D)                    (through the crack)             Hello? Oh. Come in.She opens the door.                        ANNINA NOSEI             Is Jean Michel here?                           GINA             No.Closed in the bathroom, Jean smiles while eavesdropping.                        ANNINA NOSEI             I'm here to see some work.Annina starts noticing all the work around her. Gina hands her astack of drawings.                        ANNINA NOSEI (CONT'D)             These are great.                        GINA             Aren't they?                        ANNINA NOSEI             How much for these five?                      GINA           You should talk to him about this.Annina contains her excitement.                       ANNINA NOSEI                  (continuing to stare at the                  work)           Um... Do Rene and Jean have a contract           together?We see Jean in the bathroom looking at himself in the mirror witha bird's nest on his head.                      ANNINA NOSEI (CONT'D)           I'm interested in showing Jean's work.                      GINA           I really think you should talk to him about           this.Jean pops out of the bathroom.                      BASQUIAT           When?                      ANNINA NOSEI           How about right now?She opens the door.Unnoticed, Gina starts for the bedroom.                       GINA                  (calling back)           Be ready in a minute!                                                    CUT TO:THE DOOR SLAMSAs Jean exits with Annina.INT. TAXI - DAYJean waits in a taxi in front of Benny's apartment.                      BASQUIAT           Honk the horn again, will you please?The DRIVER obliges. The back of the cab is loaded with all hisbelongings. Boxes piled with junk. Bags of new painting supplies.Benny emerges from his building and jumps into the cab.                       BASQUIAT (CONT'D)                  (annoyed)           You're late.                  (to cabby)           One-fourteen Prince.The cab pulls out. Jean lights a joint. and smokes it furiously.He doesn't pass it to Benny.                      BENNY           What's the rush, John Henry?                      BASQUIAT           I ain't John Henry.                      BENNY           Good.                      BASQUIAT           What's your fuckin' problem, anyway?Benny holds out his hand for the joint.                       BENNY                  (inhaling)           I don't really have any problems.                      BASQUIAT           Good. What do you have?                      BENNY           What's your fuckin' problem? You get a           girlfriend and a little attention and then           start acting all uppity with me.                       BASQUIAT                  (mortified)           'Uppity?' Like as in 'uppity nigger?'He snaps his finger for the joint back.                       BENNY           That's not how I meant it.                  (beat)           For all you know, you might just be a flash           in the pan! You can never tell.                      BASQUIAT           Hey fuck you! I deserve this shit. You're           just jealous 'cause it ain't happening to           you!The cab stops for a red light. Benny gets out. He doesn't say aword. Jean doesn't look at him. The cab sails off.EXT. ANNINA NOSEI GALLERY - DAYIt stops in front of the gallery. From outside, we see Anninaconversing on the phone. She looks up and opens the door for him.INT. STAIRWELL - BLACK.Off screen we HEAR Jean walking down the stairs.                      ANNINA NOSEI           I've got to find the switch.INT - BASEMENT, ANNINA'S - DAYAnnina flips on a light.                         ANNINA NOSEI           Here it is.Jean looks around him. He's in a large, empty cement-floored roomlit by fluorescent lights.INT. BASEMENT, ANNINA'S - (LATER) - DAYJean bends over, beginning several canvases. He pours paint onthem - kind of like photographs we've seen of Jackson Pollock. WeHEAR Miles Davis' "Flamenco Sketches."INT - BASEMENT, ANNINA'S - DAY (LATER)GRANDMASTER FLASH'S "WHITE LINES" fills the room.The walls are covered with half-finished, unstretched CANVASES.Two or three more lie on the floor.He works like a maniac, buzzing back and forth from one paintingto another, adding figures, crossing out words, all the whilesmoking and eating cookies. The crumbs fall onto the paintings.He walks on them.Every so often, he refers to a book of DaVinci drawings. Tornpages litter the floor beneath the book.We hear someone THUMPING down the stairs.It's Rene. A PUPPY follows him.He dumps a huge load of paint supplies, art books, and carryoutribs. The puppy sniffs around happily, licking at Jean andwalking over the paintings, wagging his tail.He stops the tape player and inserts some Persian music.Jean empties some foil-wrapped bags of coke. He cuts a line ofcoke on a foil plate.Rene starts reading from a poem he's evidently written:                      RENE           3rd night I called    him 'boy'           He sed "don't call    me 'boy'" "Well           Then don't call me    'Boss'" That           Was the end for us    and I've           Been seeing him for    2 1/2 years.           In kangaroo court I    want to be           Able to say I never kept a           Slave. But he tricked me in           To Tying him up and busting his           Face. He'll jump up at my Trial           Yelling 'He wupped me gud.'Jean warms the plate 'til the coke crackles, and then "chases thedragon," sucking the smoke through a straw.He offers it to Rene, who refuses. He lights and hands Rene thejoint. Rene takes a hit. Jean takes it back.Jean starts to work again.The PUPPY runs around, chasing after him, getting in his way,running across the paintings. Jean laughs, playing tag. The puppygets a hold of Jean's sleeve. It unravels about ten feet.While Jean's playing, Rene spots a painting with the words"Famous Negro Athletes."                      RENE           Oh man! That's one looks famous already.Without hearing him, Jean walks towards the painting and with aswipe, paints out what Rene is pointing to.                       RENE (CONT'D)           You are a willful boy. How'm I s'posed to           write about you if you keep changing           everything?The phone RINGS... Jean ignores it. Rene gets it -                       RENE (CONT'D)           Uh huhh... Band practice?                  (to Jean)           It's Benny. He wants to know why you're not           at band practice...?                       BASQUIAT                  (quietly)           Fuck...                  (to Rene)           I forgot about that.He sets his brush down.Rene hold the phone against his leg.                      RENE           Fuck band practice... If you're gonna be a           painter you're gonna have to break a few           hearts - you don't wanna be like Tony           Bennett..                      BASQUIAT           Tony Bennett... What do you mean?                      RENE           Singing on stage and painting in your spare           time.                      BASQUIAT           I didn't know Tony Bennett painted.                      RENE           My point exactly.Jean picks up the phone... All he hears is a DIAL TONE.                      RENE (CONT'D)           So keep painting.                       BASQUIAT           Yes, Boss.                  (beat)           If you're so smart, why are you here with           me in this basement?                       RENE           You're news. I want the scoop. I write it           down. When I speak, no one believes me. But           when I write it down, people know it's           true.                  (beat)           There's never been a black painter in art           history that's been considered really           important, you know?                      BASQUIAT           So what?                      RENE           So shut up and keep painting..                       BASQUIAT                  (touched)           What time is it?                      RENE           5:11.Jean regards a near-finished painting. He writes "5:11" on it. Hecrosses it out and re-writes it, "Rene 5:11." Rene looks pleased.                      BASQUIAT           That one's for you.                      RENE           Thanks... I'll take it tonight.                      BASQUIAT           I can't. After the show.Jean continues painting. Rene slumps down onto the floor, happy -a parasite content to have a host, impressed with Jean'slimitless energy. Rene closes his eyes.BLACKINT. ANNINA'S BASEMENT - LATERJean is bent over his work. He looks to see a pair of legs. Theybelong to Albert Milo.                      BASQUIAT           Hey - it's the big A.M..                      ALBERT MILO           Rene's been telling me about your work.Milo takes his time looking at the paintings.Jean continues to work, never wanting to appear impressed byanyone. He walks on top of the paintings.                      ALBERT MILO (CONT'D)           Is this finished yet?                      BASQUIAT           I don't know.                      ALBERT MILO           When's your show?                      BASQUIAT           Not sure. How was yours?                       ALBERT MILO           I haven't decided yet.                  (beat)           Rene, you wanna come over to the studio           tomorrow. I wanna make a painting of you.                      RENE           How about now?Rene shrugs to Jean. He prepares to leave.                      ALBERT MILO           See you at your opening. Thanks.Albert and Rene begin to ascend the stairs. Jean continuespainting. The dog leaves with Rene and Albert.                      WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)           Ohhh, Albert Milo, what a pleasure to meet           you.Jean's brush stops.                      ALBERT MILO (O.S.)           This is Rene Ricard.Jean paints over the words "Rene 5:11."We hear FOOTSTEPS COMING DOWN THE STAIRS. The woman continues -                      WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)           We're Tom and Cynthia Kruger - nice to have           met you.JEAN'S POVWe see Annina's legs coming down the stairs.REVEALA man wearing a pin-striped suit and gold-rimmed glasses. Thewoman is wrapped in a cashmere shawl.                        ANNINA NOSEI (O.S)             Tom and Cynthia Kruger.                        BASQUIAT (O.S)             I know.We SEE that Jean continues to paint, looking down.                         ANNINA NOSEI             This is Jean Michel Basquiat.                    (beat)             You've seen the SAMO graffiti everywhere.             That's his. This is the true voice of the             gutter.As she speaks, Jean squirms. He grabs a banana from a fruit bowl.Without peeling it, he takes a big bite. And another. Andanother. Everyone looks uncomfortable. Annina starts showing themthe paintings.                        CYNTHIA KRUGER             We've seen the graffiti. I work on Wall             Street. And I've heard wonderful things             about the paintings. Everybody's talking             about you.                        BASQUIAT             Yeah.He looks up at them, eating the banana.                         ANNINA NOSEI             Here's a very good example of his recent             work that's not spoken for yet.                    (beat)             He's got to work in a basement. He's got so             much energy that if he worked in a place             with a window, he'd jump right through it.             Most of these are reserved already. After             this week, this work will not be available.                         TOM KRUGER                    (to his wife)             ... I don't know.... This one's nice, but I             don't know if I could live with it. That             green is so... institutional.He (Kruger) looks up to see two KIDS enter - young black artists,one of whom we saw with Rene at the loft party.They walk right into the middle of the room, completely obliviousto the presence of Annina and the Krugers..                       KID #1                  (enthusiastically)           Yo, man, you're a damn lucky nigger selling           this shit!                      BASQUIAT           You like it?                      KID #1           Not bad. Yeah, I do.The Krugers hem and haw in front of the painting next to Jean.                      CYNTHIA KRUGER           I'm fascinated by his choice of crossing           out words that way.                      ANNINA NOSEI           Yes, well, they are more meaningful in           their absence, no?                       KID #1                  (to Jean, joking)           What does it mean?Jean paints the words "Rene 5:11" back into a painting. Theyignore the kid..                      CYNTHIA KRUGER           I like this one, but that green...Suddenly, we see LEGS coming down the stairs. It's Gina. Everyonelooks at her.                      BASQUIAT           Y'want me to make it a nice shit brown?                         TOM KRUGER           Beg pardon?Gina hadn't expected to find herself in the middle of this scene.                      BASQUIAT           Hi. This is Gina.Annina nods to her.Gina nods to the group.                      CYNTHIA KRUGER           They're something like Dubuffet's...           That... childlike quality.Gina tries to connect with Jean. He's cold.                       CYNTHIA KRUGER (CONT'D)                  (to her husband and Annina)           I can't make up my mind.                      TOM KRUGER           I like this one.

ROCKETS           Jean Michel, my man. Nice party. Should we           step into my office?Nearby, Benny sees this meeting and walks off, disgusted,thinking this is why Jean gave him the brush off.                      BASQUIAT           That's alright. I'm cool now.Jean looks off and sees Big Pink fingering the scarf, sayingsomething to Gina.Gina slaps her in the face.Jean tries to get around the dealer.Gina turns to leave.

Mom, Dad, this is           Jean Michel Basquiat.Jean pulls out a joint and lights it as if it were a cigarette.He offers it to Albert, who takes a hit.

My mom           couldn't make it.He offers the joint to Albert's mother.                       ESTHER MILO                  (waving it away)           No thanks.Everyone laughs.                       BRUNO                  (to Jean)           I'd like to do a show with you.                  (pointing to "Rene 5:11"                  painting)           I'm especially interested in that one. I'd           like to buy it for myself.Jean spots the very word on the painting ("Rene 5:11") andfreezes for a second.                      BASQUIAT           I wasn't gonna sell this one.He looks around the room for Rene, but doesn't see him. Brunoremains smiling, waiting for an answer.                      BRUNO           You shouldn't have put it in the show. This           is the one I absolutely have to have. I           really love it.                        BASQUIAT           Sure, ok..Jean wants out. He feels compromised.                      BASQUIAT (CONT'D)           Do you think I could borrow your limousine?           I'll get it back to you in an hour.                      BRUNO           It's OK. Just have him bring you to dinner           at Mr. Chow's later. We'll be there.                        ANDY WARHOL           Bye, Jean.Jean makes his way through the crowd, as we see images of thecrowd and fragments of paintings. As he nears the door, he feelshis arm pulled.                       RENE                  (hissing)           You fucking little whore! You sold my           painting! I'm gonna tell you something,           brother - when you're climbing up the           ladder of success, don't kick out the           rungs! Believe that shit.                      BASQUIAT           I'll make you another one.                        RENE           Forget it.He pulls out a scrap of paper and starts writing.                        BASQUIAT           Rene -Rene shushes him... He hisses loudly, like a cat.                       RENE           SHHHHHH. Later.                  (speaking to himself)           "What is it about art, anyway......"Jean pauses. He turns around and surveys the room once more.A blink.Silence.We see the crowd in SLOW MOTION.Everyone's eyes are shut.                       RENE (O.S.; CONT'D)           ... that we give it so much importance?           Artists are respected by the poor because           what they do is an honest way to get out of           the slum using one's sheer self as the           medium. The money earned is proof pure and           simple of the value of that individual...           The Artist.INT. / EXT. GALLERY - NIGHTThe CAMERA rises higher and higher over the crowd and followsJean as he makes his way toward the street.We begin to DISSOLVE into a MONTAGE of stills of ARTISTS:                      RENE (O.S.CONT'D)           The picture a mother's son does in jail           hangs on her wall as proof that beauty is           possible even in the most wretched. And           this is a much different idea than the           fancier notion that art is a scam and a           rip-off. But you could never explain to           someone who uses God's gift to enslave that           you have used God's gift to be free."EXT. STREET - NIGHTJean enters a waiting limo. It pulls away from the curb.Rene finishes as the limo threads its way through the night-lit,twinkling city.INT. LIMO - NIGHTThe DRIVER is the young Rasta we saw earlier outside Ballato'sdriving Bruno and Andy.Jean slumps in the back seat.The driver can't help staring in the rearview mirror.                      DRIVER           I really... admire you.                      BASQUIAT           Me? Why?                      DRIVER           You did it! You made it. I'm a painter,           too.                      BASQUIAT           That's great.                      DRIVER           Would you check out my studio some time?                      BASQUIAT           Sure. I'd be glad to.The limo pulls over.                       DRIVER           Here?Quickly, Jean gets out of the limo. He leaves the door open.The DRIVER watches as Jean talks to two DRUG DEALERS.Jean jumps back into the limo.The driver pulls away. In the rearview mirror, he sees Jeanseparate a bag from a bundle of ten. He rips it open and snortsdirectly from it.He lays his head back and takes a deep breath.                       BASQUIAT                  (calm, relieved)           What's your name, man?                      DRIVER           They call me Steve, but I prefer Shenge.                      BASQUIAT           Nice to meet you, Shenge. Want a job?INT. MR. CHOW'S RESTAURANT - NIGHTAn elegant Chinese restaurant on the Upper East Side.

MARY BOONE                  (to Jean)           I hear your show was sold out already.           There's a very important collector who's           interested in some of your works.                      BASQUIAT           Bring him over sometime. I have some other           stuff to show him.Annina watches from the other table as Jean talks to Mary.Francesco finishes his drawing.Albert takes the book and passes it to Jean.

You shouldn't take it so seriously,           Jean. That's why you can't stop taking           drugs. You always think people don't like           you. Everyone likes you.

BASQUIAT           When I was poor, everybody doubted I could           make it. When I got rich, everyone said,           `yeah, but he'll never keep it up.' Now           everyone says `he's killing himself.' So I           clean up, and then they say `Look. His           art's dead.' I don't take drugs, anyway.           I'm healthy now.Jean obliterates Andy's logo.                      ANDY WARHOL           If you say so. You sleep until 5:00 p.m.           You call at four in the morning.

What should we do?                      BASQUIAT           Why don't you try letting her in, Steve - I           mean Shenge.                      SHENGE           Get up. She won't buy anything if she sees           me working on it!                      BASQUIAT           Wanna bet? If you show too much respect for           people with money, they don't have respect           for you.MARIA, a raven-haired, sharp-featured beauty in a Chanel suitjacket, blue jeans, and pearls walks into the room. She's withELLEN - younger - a millionaire fake hippie from Texas.Maria carries a bag with clogs in it - a present for Jean. Shetakes them out.                       MARIA                  (showing him the clogs)           These reminded me of you, the clogs. I           found them in Amsterdam.Jean doesn't get up from the floor.                      MARIA (CONT'D)           How are you?                      BASQUIAT           Fine.                       MARIA           You remember Ellen?

ELLEN           How much is something like that?Jean raises his hand and pumps five fingers three times in theair.                      MARIA           Fifteen. Reasonable.Ellen makes a snotty face.                       BASQUIAT           It's unfinished.                  (to Shenge)           How 'bout some blue in the corner?Shenge gives Jean a stupefied look.                      SHENGE           Blue? Where?                      BASQUIAT           What's wrong with you today?Shenge is embarrassed by Jean's remark in the company of the twowomen.                      BASQUIAT (CONT'D)           Don't look at me like that. It hurts my           feelings.He points. Unsure, Shenge picks up the brush and paints one ofthe corners.Maria browses through a stack of paintings leaning against thewall.                      MARIA           I love these.                      ELLEN           God... I just can't even care anymore.           Compare this to a mountain or a tree.           Who're y'all trying to kid? That's what I           think. I was just in the Himalayas, and           like - OK - is this important? No. I mean,           compared to the rain forest or something?           These are just narcissistic jokes.                       MARIA                  (to Jean)           Who are you selling these through now?Jean gets to his feet. He dips a long, thin brush into blackpaint and nonchalantly crosses out the half figure that Shenge iscarefully surrounding with blue.                       BASQUIAT           Well, that's better.                  (to Maria)           You can buy direct from me.                      ELLEN           Look at these - silkscreens? What're you?           Andy Warhol Junior? It's like - not even           handmade anymore.She's not even worth a response. Jean looks around, numb.INT. MARY BOONE GALLERY - DAYJean enters the gallery. Cleaned up. Healthier. Bruises healing.He looks like he's been painting.Mary looks up from her desk, surprised to see Jean.                      MARY BOONE           Jean Michel... Crawling from the wreckage?                      BASQUIAT           I need a dealer.                      MARY BOONE           You have a bunch of them, don't you?

MARY BOONE           It'll be ok.                      ALBERT MILO           You better take a look. Why's your door so           small? The ceilings are sixteen feet and           your door's the size of a mouse hole!                      MARY BOONE           Why are your paintings so big? Just go           home.

MARY BOONE           Bruno spoke to me already. We could talk           about it.                       BASQUIAT           I'm here.                      MARY BOONE           OK. I'll be at your studio Thursday three           o'clock.INT. ALBERT MILO'S LOFT - DAYAlbert shows Jean through a series of large rooms filled withenormous paintings.It looks like the Cairo Museum.They pause before a painting.                      ALBERT MILO           This is painted on a backdrop from the           Kabuki theater in Japan. I painted it after           Joseph Beuys died. A rebirth painting. I           felt like he could've painted it, or maybe           someone else was painting it instead of me.           The Chinese calligraphers used to change           their name mid-career so they could start           over as someone else..                      BASQUIAT           Do you ever get sick of it?                       ALBERT MILO           Of what?                      BASQUIAT           The whole thing - painting.                      ALBERT MILO           No. It's one of the few times I feel good.           I used to have to go to work and cook every           day. That I got sick of.                      BASQUIAT           What about the shit they write?                      ALBERT MILO           You're asking me this because of the           'lapdog' remark. I read that. The person           that wrote that has the compassion of a           housefly. That's your enemy, not your           audience. Your audience hasn't even been           born yet. It's a lie that art is popular.           The only thing popular about it is that           it's written about in newspapers. I'm           surprised when anybody comes to my           openings. There're about ten people on the           planet who know anything about painting,           and Andy's one of them.                      BASQUIAT           I haven't felt like talking to him since           that thing came out.                      ALBERT MILO           As long as I've known Andy, he's never           asked me for anything except to speak to           you about getting off drugs. He's painted           my picture, we've eaten dinner in God knows           how many places together. But he doesn't           care about me. He cares about you. You're           the only person he cares about. He's your           friend. Fuck that article. You want a           toasted bagel with cream cheese?Milo's daughter STELLA (12) calls out from over the balcony.                      STELLA (O.S.)           Papa, the TV's broken...

There was this little prince with a magic           crown. An evil warlock kidnapped him,           locked him in a cell in a huge tower and           took away his voice. There was a window           made of bars. The prince would smash his           head against the bars hoping that someone           would hear the sound and find him. The           crown made the most beautiful sound that           anyone ever heard. You could hear the           ringing for miles. It was so beautiful,           that people wanted to grab the air. They           never found the prince. He never got out of           the room. But the sound he made filled           everything up with beauty.
