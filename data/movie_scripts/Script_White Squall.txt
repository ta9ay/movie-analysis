Though I hadn't seen or spoken to          Sheldrake in over thirty years, it          seemed impossible that his heart was          the thing that had finally failed          him...INT.

OLDER CHUCK (V.O.)          I never got close to him, nobody          did.  But by the time we made Tampa,          I was sure I knew who he was, that I          understood what he saw, what          nourished his soul and tested his          faith...EXT.  WHARF - DAYChuck stares out across the harbor.  In the distance, theechoes of singing masts.  Shrouds and canvas softly ping.The small boats of Mystic tug restlessly at theirmoorings.                         OLDER CHUCK (V.O.)

MINISTER          I didn't know Richard Sheldrake          personally, but his many friends who          knew and worked with him, wanted to          make sure that he was returned home,          here, to be remembered with his          beloved wife...Chuck gazes out at the sleepy harbor, the minister's voicefading away.  The afternoon wind is coming up with thetide.  He quietly heads towards the water.  Drifting,drawn, lost.                         OLDER CHUCK (V.O.)          Though he had moved on with his          life, now even for the years, to          hear him eulogized by strangers,          seemed strange.  He had been a          hewner of stones, a pilot by the          silent stars.  Like me, alone among          many.  But most of all for us, the          crew of the brigantine Albatross, he          was always and would forever be...          our Skipper.A SHIP'S BELL turns him around.  Ding ding.  Ding ding.

CHUCK          I was just thinking that I never had          a new pair of shoes till I was          twelve.                         WILL          It's no my fault I was born first.          Besides, nobody ever sent me on an          eight month vacation, so ease up on          the sad sack stuff.

Will considers him, troubled.                         CHUCK          I'm just not like you.  Ya know?          I'm never going to go to Yale.  I'm          never going to be "William".                         WILL          Nobody says you have to be like me.                         CHUCK          He does.

MIDDY          It says she was originally Schooner          rigged, but Captain Sheldrake turned          her into a brigantine.  I think          square rigs look so much more          romantic.                         CHUCK          Me too.                         CHARLES          Appearances aren't everything.

TOD          Me and Skipper had a meeting of the          minds.                         CHARLIE          How's that?                         TOD          I begged.

RICK          He says they did the deed...                         TOD          Trust me, we did the deed.

We'll have her ship          shape before we shove off.This is BILL BUTLER, 15, removed, the youngest of the crewand... first mate.  Bill gives Chuck a friendly slap onthe back and climbs aboard.  He is greeted by a Vikinggiant of a man, LAWFORD, 37, and bearded, the ship'sEnglish professor.Puffing on a huge Havana cigar, he stares coolly down atTod and the others.  He speaks with the voice of Moses.                         LAWFORD          "That this same child of honor and          renown, This gallant Hotspur, this          all praised knight, And your          unthought-of Harry chance to meet.

Terry unpacksin front of one of the lower berths.A loud "THUD!" turns everyone around.  A duffel bag liesat the bottom of the companionway.  A large imposingfigure climbs into the cabin.This is JOHN GOODALL, 17, over six feet, big and broad.His hair is slicked back "Dean" style and wears a fullday's growth of bread on his face.  Compared to theothers, he looks all man.  Everybody clears from his path.He stops in front of the lower, center bunk (Terry's bunk)and drops his bag.                         JOHN          I'll take this one.                         TERRY          You probably didn't notice, but this          bunk has been taken.John just glares at him, then dumps all of Terry's thingsonto the blanket on the bunk, gathers it up and tosses itinto the remaining upper berth.  Terry watches,intimidated.                         JOHN          Anybody gotta problem with that?

Almost on cue, thesound of slow methodical footsteps, pace the deck abovethem.  Then a shadow falls across the skylight, blockingthe light.  Ominous.

Exultation is the going/ Of an          inland soul to sea/ Past the houses/          Past the headlands/ Into deep          Eternity/ Bred as we, among the          mountains/ Can the sailor          understand/ the divine intoxication/          of the first league out from land?                  (pause)          But I suppose we'll answer that          question soon enough gentlemen.          Soon enough.                         TERRY          What question?Chuck tries to assimilate Lawford's words.  Robin swingshis feet over the side of his bunk with a tortured look.John rolls over and pulls his pillow over his head.                         ROBIN                  (foggy)          What the hell is going on?                         CHUCK          Maybe it's an air raid.In crisply pressed shorts and shirt, Bill Butler stepsthrough the aft bulkhead.  He raises a bowswain's  whistleand blows.  OOOWWWEEEEOOO!!!!  Chuck and Robin grab theirears.  It's a nightmare.  Terry jumps and hits his headagain.                         BILL          Roll out sailors!  All hands on          deck!  Sixty seconds.  Sixty          seconds.He blows the whistle again.  This time it brings even Johnto his feet, staring down at Bill in a blind rage.  Billlooks up and casually notices him.                         BILL          You gotta problem Goodall?                         JOHN          You blow that thing again I'll shove          it so far up your ass, you're gonna          need dental floss to get it out.                         BILL          Just get on deck.Bill turns and disappears topside.EXT.  DECK - DAWNThe sun has barely cracked the horizon as the crewstaggers onto the deck, shirtless and shivering.                         BILL          Line up!  Single file.  Single file.The crew lines up.  John is the last one through the hatchand he lets us know his boundaries are being pressed.                         BILL          Everybody swims.The boys are aghast.                         LAWFORD          Don't think people, just go!  Go,          Go, Go, Go, Go!!!  Swim you win,          stay you pay!!Rick is the first one through the gunnel door, followed byTod and Charlie.  They howl and scream as they hit thewater.  The rest follow like lemmings.  But John standsdefiantly with his arms folded.                         BILL          Now what's the problem, Goodall?          Everybody swims.The crew are piling back on deck.  George stands in theopen galley door.  The smell of fresh bacon isintoxicating.                         JOHN          I don't.                         LAWFORD          You will if you wanna eat.  Right          George?George nods, wielding a butchers knife.  The crew standshivering, waiting on John.                         JOHN                  (to Bill)          You gonna swim for your breakfast?Bill gives John a long look then strips to his shorts,swings into the rigging and climbs up to the first yardarm.  He looks down at the water some twenty-five feetbelow.  It's a long way.  Robin turns away.Lawford booms in a voice that echoes across the harbor.                         LAWFORD          "Down, down beneath the deep, That          oft in triumph bore him, He sleeps a          sound and peaceful sleep, With the          salt waves dashing over him." --          Lord Byron gentlemen.With that Bill leaps and hits the water with a hugeKERSPLASH!  He swims to the boarding ladder, pulls himselfup and gets in John's face.                         BILL          Everybody swims.  Now, I've been in          twice.  So I guess I'll be eating          your breakfast too.John considers him, then strips off his shirt.  Butinstead of walking over to the gunnel door, he jumps intothe ratlines, climbs to the foretop and looks down.He manages a thin smile then climbs to the second set ofratlines past the third yard and continues to the top yardarm -- the topgallant.  It's a pissing contest andeverybody knows it.                         MIKE          I got five bucks says he doesn't.                         CHRIS          I got five that says he doesn't          live.                         TOD          I'll take a dollar of that.                         ROBIN          This is crazy!Robin refuses to watch.  The others share a look.John makes his way along the foot ropes and stands at theend of the yard.  He tosses a look towards Bill but withno way to back down, he launches into the air.  Everyonegasps as he thunders through the air in a broad swan dive.Falling, falling, falling...                         CHUCK          Jesus.                         ROBIN          I can't watch this.John hits the water like a bullet.  The crew run to theside waiting for him to come up.  Nothing.  Finally, hebreaks the surface.  Easy.  He climbs up waiting, somehow,to claim victory.Suddenly, they all feel it.  A presence.  He has appearedsilently on top of the Chart House, like a phantom gazingdown at them, back lit by the sun the boys must squint tosee him.RICHARD SHELDRAKE, (SKIPPER), ageless and windswept,casually reaches up to a block and tackle with one arm andglides to the deck.  He is powerfully built and bronzedfrom the sea and sun.  He carriers the burden of commandlike a cross.  Soft-spoken and remote, he is a man to bereckoned with.  The crew know they are in the presence ofsomeone larger than life.                         BILL          Skipper on deck!The crew line up clumsily.  Skipper has a gaze that blazesright through them.He looks out to sea.  Searching, ominous.  He waits untilthe silence is filled with everyone's attention.                         SKIPPER          You know what's out there?  Wind and          wave and rain.  Endless glassy pools          that'll hold a sailing ship for          weeks and then spit her out into the          eye of the kind of hurricane.  A          blow that could knock the bridge off          a battleship.  Reefs and rocks and          sandbars that'll tear the belly from          her and enough fog and night to hide          it all.He spits into the water.  The crew sheepishly throwglances to the horizon.                         SKIPPER          So look out there... and explain to          me why any man in possession of any          sense at all, would take on the sea          with sail?Skipper turns his gaze back to the boys.  There is a firein his eyes.  Nobody dare answers.                         SKIPPER          Because there's something else out          there.  It beckons in the wind and          sings in the shrouds.  Voices.          Whispering...His ear to the wind.                         SKIPPER          They're voices of men.  Calling.  Men          you don't even know.  Men you can't          even imagine.  It's a seed, a wish,          that part of you and I that aches to          be alive, that was banished by          everything we've ever been taught or          told.  It's a part of us that can          only be found on mountain tops and          deserts, in the deepest caverns,          smoking battle fields and... across          oceans.He turns back to the sea, dark.                         SKIPPER          Out there, is where it all waits.                         OLDER CHUCK (V.O.)          He was everything I had expected,          part Ahab part Queeg and even Bligh.          He spoke in whispers and answered          all queries with efficiency and          directness.  He had gone to sea for          the first time at fifteen, the same          age as Bill Butler.  And as he          looked upon us that first day it          must have been as though he were          staring into a mirror.Skipper manages a sobering look and climbs on top of thechart house.  He pats a small brass sign that is welded tothe main mast and reads the inscription.                         SKIPPER                  (reading)          "Where we go one, we go all."With that, he disappears below.  Nobody moves.  This isexactly the kind of man you want around when the shit hitsthe fan.                         TERRY          This -- is gonna be a long eight          months.INT.  MAIN CABIN - DAYThe boys devour a hearty breakfast.  Tod is the 'galleyslave' and fills glasses with orange juice.                         TOD          Chow down boys.  The milk and eggs          are the first things to go once we          put out.John enters balancing two plates heaped with food.                         RICK          You know we gotta dumbwaiter for          that.John looks over to the dumbwaiter mounted in the wall.                         RICK          Not that one.  Tod-o here.The guys groan.                         TOD          Har, har, har...John approaches the full table, glaring down at Terry whodoesn't notice him.  Finally he looks up, startled.                         TERRY          I'm done.  I'm finished...He scrambles to get up and clear his plate.  John sitsdown without a word.  The others notice the two plates offood.                         RICK          Hungry, Goodall?He just grunts and starts eating.  Robin watches him.                         JOHN          What's your problem?                         ROBIN          Why'd you jump?                         JOHN          Because I felt like it.                  (sharp)          What do you care?                         ROBIN                  (aside)          I couldn't do it.                         JOHN          Well, as soon as you grow some          balls, let me know.Robin bristles.                         ROBIN          Screw you!                         CHARLIE          He's right.  It was a stupid stunt.                         JOHN          Excuse me?                         CHARLIE          You heard me.John grabs Charlie by his private parts and hoists himinto the air.  Charlie gasps, the air sucked from hislungs.                         JOHN          Don't ever call me stupid.                         ROBIN          Come on, he didn't mean anything.John shoves Robin to the floor with his free arm.                         JOHN          Let me tell you girls something.  I          do what I wanna do.  When I wanna do          it.  And I don't give a shit what          old Ahab up there thinks either.          Any questions?John releases Charlie who crumples to the floor.  Johnresumes eating.Bill enters and reads the duty roster.                         BILL          Okay, here's the duty.  Gieg,          Weathers, Lapchick, Schucart:          scrape and paint.  Corry and          Stricklin have the brass.  Robinson,          you're the Galley slave.  March          you're on chain gang with Barnes.          Johnston, solo on bilge detail.                         TOD          Butler, what'd I ever do to you?                         BILL          You came back, Tod.  You came back.John continues to eat.  When he realizes his name hasn'tbeen called, he looks up to meet Bill's eyes.INT.  HEADPissed, John tries to figure out the head.  Pumps goingin, pumps going out.                         OLDER CHUCK (V.O.)          We were all thirteen individuals.          We'd arrived the sum total of our          limited experiences and the result          of our parents' best, if not narrow,          expectations...John pulls back on the lever, belching "water de letoilet" all over him.EXT.  SHIP - DAYChuck sits in a bowswain's chair over the side, with apaint roller in his hand.  The rust-streaked hull is beingtransformed.                         OLDER CHUCK (V.O.)          ... Some of us were there for          discipline, some for escape.  But I          could see a small piece of myself in          all of them and though I fought the          notion, for me, I knew now, this          would be home.A RADIO crackles in the b.g.                         ANNOUNCER          "President Eisenhower today          acknowledged that a secret American          spy plane was in fact shot down over          the Soviet Union.  The pilot has          been confirmed as Francis Gary          Powers..."Robin, Terry and Mike, are on the deck within earshot ofChuck with chisels and wire brushes chipping away at therust.                         TERRY          Why couldn't it have been a wooden          boat?                         MIKE          Steel boats don't leak.Mike lights up a cigarette.  Robin notices.  Marlboro's.                         ROBIN          Hey, can I have one?Mike sizes up Robin for a moment then tosses him the pack.                         ROBIN          Thanks daddy-o.Robin lights up, grimacing with the first drag.                         TERRY          Well, don't brush too hard.  Looks          to me like the only thing holding          this bucket together is the rust.A voice booms up from the dock.                         FRANCIS (O.S.)          Ahoy there.They turn.  Standing on the dock is FRANCIS BOUTILLIER,self important and overbearing, with his son, PHILIP, wholooks as if this whole ordeal is some kind of punishment.Skipper appears.                         SKIPPER          Good afternoon.Francis boards without being invited.  Philip follows inhis shadow.  He scrutinizes the condition of the boat.                         FRANCIS          Albatross?  Doesn't inspire a lot of          confidence.                         SKIPPER          Oh, on the contrary, the Albatross          is considered a very good omen.  It          is said they embody the spirits of          sailors passed on.  It's very bad          luck if you kill one.  And dolphins          too.The boys chuckle.                         FRANCIS          I'm Francis Boutillier.  This is my          son, Philip.                         SKIPPER          I know.Francis looks the Skipper over, reading him, smiling.                         SKIPPER          You're a day late.  We keep a          schedule aboard ship.  Lives depend          on it.                  (to Philip)          Hello, Philip.                         PHIL          Sir.Skipper's directness bugs Francis.                         FRANCIS          Your cable said you wouldn't be          putting out until mid-October.                         SKIPPER          As you can see, there's a lot to do.                         FRANCIS          Indentured servitude is not what my          son had in mind.                         SKIPPER          This is a working ship.  Promptness          is not a luxury, it's a necessity,          as is the work to maintain her.  Had          we been ready, I can assure you we          would have sailed.Something in this exchange turns the tone of conversation.                         FRANCIS          And I would have expected          compensation for my time and expense          coming all the way down here.                         SKIPPER          Happily, it all worked out... This          time.                  (to Bill)          Bill, take Philip below and help him          find a bunk.Phil follows Bill down the companionway.                         FRANCIS          I'll be frank with you.  This was          his mother's idea.  A romp through          the Caribbean on a sailboat sounds          more like a vacation than an          education if you ask me.                         SKIPPER          It will be more than that, I can          promise you.                         FRANCIS                  (cool)          Take good care of my son.There is threat in his tone.                         SKIPPER          We'll do our best.  You're welcome          to say goodbye.                         FRANCIS          He's a big boy.Francis leaves the boat.  Skipper and the crew watch as heclimbs into his waiting embassy limousine and drives off.                         LAWFORD          Well, that was neighborly.                         SKIPPER          He didn't get to be Under Secretary          of the Air Force by being          neighborly.Lawford shakes his head.  Bill comes up through thecompanionway.                         SKIPPER          Everyone aboard young Bill?                         BILL          Yes, Sir.                         SKIPPER          Good.                  (beat)          Let's go sailing.EXT.  ALBATROSS - OPEN WATER - DAYThe Albatross is under full power.  There is a sense ofexcitement and anticipation.  Charlie, Rick, Robin, andLawford are on the halyard for the mainsail.  Skipper isat the helm with Alice and Bill nearby.  Skipper callsover to Chuck who stands alone at the rail.                         SKIPPER          Come over here and take the wheel.Chuck's eyes light up as he walks over and takes thewheel.                         SKIPPER          Hold her steady into the wind.          Southwest by west.                         CHUCK          Yes sir.                         SKIPPER                  (to all)          Gentleman, when you hear an order,          sing out.  I want to know that          you've heard and understand.                  (quietly to Bill)          Raise the mainsail.                         BILL                  (calling out)          Raise the main!Lawford and his group bellow out.                         TOGETHER          Raise the main!!Lawford coaches the boys, sending two scurrying on top thechart house to loosen the stops which hold the heavyfurled canvas to the main boom.  He guides another to themidships pinrail where the main halyard, which raises thehuge sail, is made fast to a belaying pin.  He loosens thehalyard and hands it to Robin.                         SKIPPER          Take a turn under the pin and lead          it out to the others.  You guys in          the rear take up the slack.  Heave          together now...In a beautiful tenor voice, Bill begins to croon a seachanty, an old whaling song with an Irish lilt.                         BILL                  (singing)          "When the sun came up there was          whisky in the cup..."The more experienced boys echo the line and pull to thebeat.                         BOYS          "When the sun came up there was          whisky in the cup..."                         LAWFORD          Come on the rest of you, sing!  Belt          it out like men!!The newer guys like Chuck, John, Robin and Terry look ateach other like this is the queerest thing they have everheard of.                         BILL                  (singing)          "Not one of us was a sober..."The boys return the verse half heartedly.  Lawford tiesoff his line and stares them down.  Skipper notices thatthe work has stopped.                         SKIPPER          What's wrong Mr. Lawford.                         LAWFORD          It seems we're short on singers.Skipper walks amid ship and addresses the crew.                         SKIPPER          Everyone sings aboard a wind jammer          gentlemen.  It lets everyone know          you're in sync.  It shows unity,          that all thoughts are one.  A crew          that sings together stays together.          Besides, I like it.  So, pipe up and          be sailors.                         JOHN                  (in a whisper)          Everybody swims, everybody sings...          What's next?  Tap dancing?Lawford and Rick leap up onto the line pulling it downwith their body weight.  They sing out the chorus.  Thecrew returns the song, somewhat reluctantly as the greatmainsail starts to rise.                         LAWFORD          Tie it off!!                         SKIPPER                  (to Bill)          Outer.                         BILL          Outer Jib!                         CHARLIE                  (confused)          Outta what?Coached by Tod, another group in the bow, awkwardly hoistthe jib.                         SKIPPER                  (to Bill)          We'll bear off to port and run down          wind.                         BILL          Mr. Lawford, stand by to ease the          mainsheet.  Rick, get on the jib          sheet.  George, John, Philip, Tim          and Dick go aloft to unstop the          forecourse.  George will show you          what to do.  Tod, show your men the          forward pinrail and stand ready on          the buntlines and clewlines.          Forecourse first... work upward.The newcomers watch Bill with new-found respect.  George,John and the others climb to the forecourse, and out ontothe footropes.  It's unsteady work and there's confusioneverywhere.  But through it all, they continue to sing.Lawford moves to the mainsheet on the port side while theothers move into their positions.  When Bill sees theyardarm crew is in place...                         BILL          Unstop the squares!                         YARDARM CREW          Unstop the squares!!                         SKIPPER                  (to Chuck)          Fall off to port.  Ease her around          to a heading of northeast.  Sing out          when you're there.As the tops are released, the giant forecourse drapes intoa scalloped pattern.  As the bow falls off the wind thesnapping main and jib billow.  Stiffening to the wind, theship heels and surges forward.Before her awakening power, everyone changes their stanceand grabs for a handhold.  Lawford slowly pays out themainsheet while the forecourse crew move up the ratlinesreleasing the stops on the other squaresails.                         CHUCK                  (in a whisper)          Ah... Northeast... sir.                         SKIPPER                  (barking)          Speak up boy!Chuck jumps, startled.  He self-consciously calls out.                         CHUCK          Northeast sir!                         SKIPPER          Unfurl the squares!Tod's group first uncleats the clewlines and buntlines andthe great squaresail drops and billows to fullness sendinga shudder through the rig.  The bow's wake sizzles withthe added surge.  As each of the squares fall, Alice andLawford move to their sheets, setting each sail'sposition.Chuck looks up, amazed at the sheer magnitude and beautyof the canvas that the Albatross carries.                         BILL          Raise the inner jib!  Raise the          forestaysail!                         SKIPPER          Watch the tell-tales Chuck.  If we          jibe now we'll have a lot of people          in the water.                         CHUCK          Yes, sir.                         SKIPPER          All stop on the engine.                         BILL          All stop on the engine!Bill rotates the telegraph handle back and forth and movesit to the stop position.                         SKIPPER          Behold gentlemen.  The power of the          wind!As the sails billow the Albatross seems transformed.Everyone stops and looks up.  The vessel heels and with apowerful surge, launches into the waves.  White foamsplashes over the bowsprit as the hull thunders throughthe water.  Chuck's face is full of wonder.  It is amagical moment.  Then the crew begins to cheer.                         SKIPPER          Did we lose anybody?                         ALICE          Not yet.LONG SHOTThe Albatross under full sail is the handsome, powerfulimage of another time.  And yet, here she is.ON DECKEach of the boys is awed by the majesty of this moment.Music builds.                         SKIPPER          Chart us a course for the windward          side.Alice considers his request.                         ALICE          That low passed through last night.          May be a little bumpy out there.                         SKIPPER          It's time these boys saw some real          blue water.EXT.  THE OPEN SEA - LATERThe bow of the Albatross explodes through the top of afifteen foot swell.  The sky is clear but the wind isfierce.  In spite of the seas the ship is trimmed andsailing well.The crew has never seen mountains of water like this.Disaster seems imminent.  Bill has assembled them in frontof the wheel house.  They are all holding on for dearlife.  Even John seems shaken.  Skipper magically standseffortlessly before them on the rolling deck.  He remainsperfectly dry.                         SKIPPER          Well... now that I have your          undivided attention... I'd like to          take this opportunity to make a few          points...                         TERRY                  (aside)          This guy is certifiable...                         PHIL          Suicidal...                         SKIPPER          The first thing is I don't like          people talking when I'm talking so          the two of you, shut up.Caught, Terry and Phil button up.                         SKIPPER          Second, the next one of you who          doesn't jump like a bunny when Mr.          Butler gives an order is gonna spend          the rest of this trip scrubbing          bilges.  He's a better sailor today          than any ten of you will be when          this is all over.Skipper directs the next comment directly at John.                         SKIPPER          And if I catch anybody, ever,          jumping off a yard arm again I will          personally break what bones are left          and send you home in a wheel chair.A wave explodes over the bow.  A wall of water crashesover the deck knocking down several of the boys.  Terrycan't take it anymore and explodes.                         TERRY          We're gonna die!!!  We're all gonna          die!He lunges at Skipper but Lawford one arms him.                         SKIPPER          Excellent point.  As you might have          noticed, being out here pretty much          puts you in the moment.  If you          panic, if you lose your head, you          die.  Maybe you take your mates with          you.  How'd you like to have to bet          on Terry here getting us home today?          Each one of you is responsible for          the rest.  "Where we go one, we go          all".  If your buddy is asleep at          the switch we're all fish food.He's making his point which is lost on no one.                         SKIPPER          The ship beneath you is not a toy          and sailing is not a game.  The          Albatross will take us far          gentlemen, but she demands constant          attention.  Respect her, and we'll          do fine.  Oh, and one more thing.          There is nothing that goes on, on          this boat that I don't know about.          She speaks to me in the night.  So          don't test me.  Not even a little.Skipper walks over and puts an arm around Terry who isfighting sobs.                         SKIPPER          Nothing like experience to put          things in perspective.  Huh son?                  (to Bill)          Alright.  Let's go home.INT.  CHART HOUSE - DAYLawford addresses some of the crew.  Chuck, Robin and Johnare among them.  John glares at Lawford.  The guys giggle.                         LAWFORD          That's not a satisfactory answer.                         JOHN          Look, save it for somebody else will          ya.  This ancient shit doesn't have          anything to do with me.Lawford pauses for a moment and then explodestheatrically.                         LAWFORD          Shit?!!!He slams a text book into John's hands.                         LAWFORD          Read for me please the words of Mr.          Keats at the bottom of the page.John stares back, simmering.  Robin interrupts thepotential confrontation and reaches for the book.                         ROBIN          I'll read it.  I mean I don't mind.                         JOHN          Shut up donut.John pushes Robin's hands away and studies the page for amoment.  He begins reading but struggles with the cadence.                         JOHN                  (reading)          Much have I traveled in realms of          gold/ And many goodly states and          kingdoms seen/ Round many western          islands have I been/ Which bards in          fealty to Apollo hold/ Oft of one          wide expanse had I been told/ That          deep-browed Homer ruled as his          demesne.                         LAWFORD          You know what he is talking about          here?Blank faces.                         LAWFORD                  (ranting)          Awe.  Humility.  He's telling you          that he has traveled the seas as          Homer did.  As Ulysses had before          him as he tried to find his way home          to Ithaca after the Trojan Wars.          "That deep browed Homer"...He points to his head.                         LAWFORD          Brilliant, seasoned, wise, of the          mind; "... ruled as his demesne."          He commands the voyage of the          imagination, like a god.                  (pause)          That is what one of the greatest          literary minds of modern times, Mr.          Boutillier, has to say about Homer.He snatches the book back.                         LAWFORD          You think the Odyssey is dull?  I'll          tell you something, it's about each          one of you -- right now.  Doubt and          expectation.  Friendship, community,          self sacrifice and accountability.He holds up the text.                         LAWFORD          This isn't just a story!!  It's          history made allegory.  It is a          philosophical handbook for life!  It          holds the secret of this very          voyage.                         JOHN          What is it... the secret?Lawford breaks into a huge belly laugh.                         JOHN                  (confused)          What?                         LAWFORD          If it were only that simple, my          young friend.  Read on, gentlemen.          Read on.EXT.  ALBATROSS - ESTABLISHING - DAYAerial shot.  The Albatross is under full sail leavingBermuda for the last time.                         OLDER CHUCK (V.O.)          And so it was the Albatross that          took to the open sea with the wind          in her snapping canvas and a bone of          white foam in her teeth... In each          of us were feelings of anticipation          and hesitation for the man at the          wheel and of the unfamiliar world he          was leading us into.She crashes through the surf -- driving, majestic music,building.DECK - DAYThe crew hauls in the line, raising the mainsail.  Chuckstruggles to coil the rope as fast as it is coming in.ALOFTThe crew take turns racing up the ratlines into therigging.BOWSPRIT NETThe crew pull down the jib trying to furl it.  Most of thesail ends up dragging in the water.ABOVEThe squaresails are dropped simultaneously.WIDEWhite foam boils from the bow of the Albatross as shecrashes through the waves.AT THE WHEELAlice smiles and puts her arms around Skipper's waist.It's coming together.FORETOP - SAMESkipper stands at the rail, looking out.  The seas are upand the masts are pitching widely from side to side.Chuck is high above the deck in the footropes, wrestlingwith one of the squaresails.  The pitching mast catcheshim by surprise and he slips.  He tumbles down, tangled inthe lines.  A rope wraps around his neck, choking him.Robin looks up and sees him hanging helplessly.                         ROBIN          Bill!!  Skipper!!Robin freezes.  Skipper leaps into the rigging like aspider and, in a few seconds, wrestles Chuck free andcarries him down to the deck.  Chuck coughs, catching hisbreath.  The color is gone from Skipper's face.  This wasa close call.                         SKIPPER          You all right?                         CHUCK          It was my fault.  I slipped.Alice examines Chuck, making sure he's okay.  Skipperturns to Robin, who is shaken.  He never raises his voice.                         SKIPPER          Why didn't you go up there?Robin stands silently.                         SKIPPER          Speak up.Still nothing from Robin.                         CHARLIE          He's afraid to climb.                         SKIPPER          What?                  (to Robin)          Is that true?Robin looks away.                         SKIPPER          Why wasn't I made aware of this          Bill?                         BILL          I didn't know sir.                         SKIPPER          It's your job to know.  If something          goes wrong up there, the other          eighteen people aboard can't be          wondering if he's gonna do his job          or not.Skipper returns his gaze to Robin, measuring him.Finally.                         SKIPPER          Swing up, son.                         ROBIN                  (trembling)          What?                         SKIPPER          Up you go.  Right now.Robin reluctantly pulls himself up onto the first rung,then the second.  He stops and steals a peek up.  The mastis swaying.  He freezes, his lip starts to tremble.  Alleyes are on him.  Phil chuckles.                         SKIPPER          Do you have something to say?                         PHIL                  (smug)          No.                         SKIPPER          Then keep your mouth shut.Phil backs off, stunned.  Robin can't move.                         SKIPPER                  (to Robin)          What's it going to be?                         ROBIN          I'm sorry...                         SKIPPER          Sorry won't cut it.Robin holds on frozen.  Skipper turns to the crew.                         SKIPPER          Survival means discipline and          assimilation.  There are no special          cases here.                  (to Robin)          Now, get going.  Get up there.Humiliated, a tear slips down his face.  Excruciating.                         SKIPPER          What are you blubbering about?                         ROBIN          I don't know...Skipper jumps onto the backside of the ratlines.  His faceis but inches from Robin's.                         SKIPPER          One hand in front of the other son.          We'll do it together.Robin reaches for the next rung.  He looks down.  Skippergrowls at him.                         SKIPPER          Don't look down.  Look in my eyes!          Climb!  We'll do it together.                         ROBIN                  (sobbing)          I can't.                         SKIPPER          You climb damn it, or so help me          I'll haul you to the foretop by your          diaper and leave you there!                         ROBIN          Aaauuuhhh!!!Skipper gets right in his face and snarls.                         SKIPPER          Are you hating this?!  Are you!                         ROBIN          I hate you, you son of a bitch!!!                         SKIPPER          No.  Hate the fear inside of you!          Climb like a man mister!  Hate it!          Hate it away.  Hate your way up one          more rung!!  Do it right now!!With every ounce of strength, Robin reaches for one morerung screaming as he reaches.  Skipper climbs and screamswith him.                         TOGETHER          Auuuggghhh!!!!Robin clutches the rung with a death grip.  Then, he looksdown.  His bladder releases.  Hot urine runs down his legsand splashes, steaming, onto the deck.  The crew ishorrified.  Robin weeps.                         ROBIN          Oh, god...Skipper backs off.                         SKIPPER          Don't hate yourself.  Hate your          weakness.  All right.  Get down.Robin climbs to the deck and falls in with the others,mortified.                         SKIPPER          I'm only gonna say this one time.          I'm not here to wipe noses and          asses.  I'm not your mother.  Trust          funds and blue blazers don't get you          a thing out here.  You wanna act          like babies, then get off my boat.Stunned, the crew is speechless.  Chuck instinctively goesto help Robin.  Skipper snaps like a turtle.                         SKIPPER                  (to Chuck)          He can take care of himself.                  (to others)          Any other 'phobias' I need to know          about?Skipper fires a look towards Phil.                         PHIL          No, sir.                         SKIPPER          Excellent.  Bill, find Mr. Weathers          a position to suit his condition.Skipper turns and then stops.                         SKIPPER          Remember something, sooner or          later... we all have to face it.                         CHUCK                  (aside)          Face what?The question hangs in the air like a cloud.INT.  CHART HOUSE - DUSKThe chart house is the communication and navigation centerfor the boat.  It also serves as the officers dining room.Skipper, Alice, Lawford, George, and Bill Butler sitaround the small table sipping coffee.                         SKIPPER          We're awfully quiet tonight.The group remains silent.  Lawford and George exchange aglance.  Skipper catches it.                         SKIPPER          Something on your mind, George?George looks up and wipes his mouth with a napkin.                         GEORGE          I think you were too hard on          Weathers.                         SKIPPER          You do?                         GEORGE          Yes.  I do.Skipper nods.                         SKIPPER          I need to know what I'm working          with; what their boundaries are.          Their lives depend on it, and for          that matter so does yours.  We've          got to bring them together.  Make          them a crew.  We're as strong as our          weakest link and I don't want to          find that out the hard way.  So, I          will challenge them and they will          come together.                         GEORGE                  (sarcastic)          Yes sir.                         SKIPPER          You know the best thing about being          a Skipper is the worst thing.  It's          all my responsibility.  So I'll tell          you what George, you stay off of my          bridge, and I'll stay out of your          galley.  We'll get along that way.Everyone's quiet, but clear.  Skipper and Alice exit.                         GEORGE          Fucking bastard.Lawford lets out a belly laugh.                         LAWFORD          I've seen him snatch the tail of the          tempest and stuff it, screaming,          into a bottle.  The bilges are full          of them.                         GEORGE          What do you mean?                         LAWFORD          He's been beyond the reach.  To the          edge of the abyss and back.  He'll          do well by us all George.  He's a          real salt.  There's no malice in him          and there's nothing more dear to him          than his boys.  So sleep well my          friend.Lawford seductively produces a pair of Havana cigars,passes one to George and winks.INT.  GALLEY - DUSKRobin leans over the sink elbow deep in dishwater watchingthrough the cabin window, as the sun slips below thehorizon.  Chuck stands in the doorway with a plate offood.                         CHUCK          How ya doing?                         ROBIN                  (without turning)          Fine.                         CHUCK          Good.                         ROBIN          Look, I appreciate, you know, the          concern and all, but like he said, I          can take care of myself.                         CHUCK          I just brought you something to eat.Robin turns and notices the plate of food and nods.  Theystand silently.  It's awkward.                         CHUCK          I feel like I got you into this.                         ROBIN          Forget it.                         CHUCK          I'm used to spending a lot of time          alone.  I guess that's what I          thought it would be out here.  But,          it's not is it?                         ROBIN                  (beat)          I'm sorry I left you hanging up          there.                         CHUCK          It doesn't matter.  Really.  I'm          just sorry you got chewed out.Robin nods.  They both stare out at the rising moon.                         ROBIN          My brother and I used to climb to          the top of this old beech tree in          the back yard and watch the moon          come up just like this.  My parents          would fight all the time so we'd          sneak out there where we couldn't          hear 'em and recite scenes from our          favorite movies.Robin grows quiet.                         ROBIN          Would you believe I miss it?  The          middle of paradise and I'm homesick.Chuck smiles and puts a hand on his back.

Show a little          backbone!                  (to Tod)          You believe that?!Tod is fixated on Terry.  Suddenly, without warning, hebreaks for the rail and lets fly.Phil and Charlie are next.  Chris climbs through thecompanionway but doesn't make it to the side.  Spontaneousregurgitation.  Bill and Lawford jump up onto the wheelhousing to avoid being sprayed.  Suddenly everyone isheaving.                         CHRIS          Sorry.

John joins Chuck watching theevents around him.                         JOHN          Well Gieg, I'm glad to see I'm not          the only guy on this boat that can          take a little rock'n roll.  Bunch of          wusses, I swear...!Chuck watches each of his shipmates.  Then, suddenly, outof nowhere -- Projectile vomit all over John.  He looks atChuck, horrified, then he too, cuts loose over the rail.                         JOHN          Son of a bitch!!Chuck looks at John, furious with himself, and begins tolaugh.  But after a moment he starts to laugh too.  It'sinfectious, they crack each other up.  Then, in the middleof belly laughing, they simultaneously retch again overthe side.INT.  SKIPPER'S CABIN - DAYSkipper sits at his desk with some charts spread out infront of him.  There's a knock on the door.                         SKIPPER          Come in.                         BILL          Skipper, uh, the crew is pretty much          doing group boot over the side.                         SKIPPER          Well, that's all part of it.

SKIPPER          Sometimes it gets exciting out here.                         LAWFORD          What do you think?                         SKIPPER          Barometer's dropping.

SKIPPER          You can't run from the wind son.          You trim your sails, face the music          and let the chips fall.

Drop everything but the          inner jib.  I want everybody down          before we get any lightning.Bill bolts forward with Lawford barking orders.  Most ofthe crew are still ill, but climb into the rigging andbegin dropping sail.                         GEORGE          Why's it always happen at night?Skipper regards George, annoyed.                         SKIPPER          George... I want hot food in          everybody.  Get to it.George returns to the galley.  Alice joins Skipper at thewheelhouse handing him foul-weather gear.                         ALICE          Looks like weather.

CHUCK          If it's all the same, I'd like to          stay on deck.Skipper regards Chuck, who looks back with both fear andeagerness.  Suddenly he sees something in this kid.  Maybehimself.

BOW - SAMEThe shredded jib and rigging whip violently in the wind.The block smashes into the gunnel rail, shattering it.  Noone dares go near it.  For a moment, it seems to hangthere seductively.  John, naive of its power, leaps forthe rail and grabs it.                         ALICE          NOOO!!!Suddenly, the wind cracks the sail instantly hurling Johnhigh off the deck and over the side.

The storm lasted sixteen hours and          it set us all on equal footing.  It          was the first time that we shared an          episode on an even plane.  As we          stood our watches we were equally          out of control of our situation,          regardless of our physical abilities          or social backgrounds.

Bring him in close and try to hold          him steady.George leans out over the rail, trying to get the hookinto a gill.  Several of the boys hold onto him as thefish flops around violently.                         GEORGE          Got him!Skipper comes down to inspect the catch.  The shark islonger than Terry is tall and thrashes in the the water,snapping and twisting.  Terry stands shaking, freaked.All of them are.                         RICK          Damn Terr, you're whiter than Sister          Mary Anne's butt.The guys laugh nervously.  Terry just stares at the maneater, but it's infectious.  After a moment he's laughingtoo.

SKIPPER          I guess we know what the next          acquisition for the galley is going          to be...                         GEORGE          What's that?                         SKIPPER          A padlock.On the boys.  Phil is drunkest of them all and does a wildjig as the rest of them sing.                         RICK          So to all you sailors who've fought          wind and whale...                         ALL          Weight!  Hey!  Blow the man down...                         RICK          She said "None the better, you all          go to hell..."                         ALL          Give me some time to Blow the man          down!They all crack up.                         CHRIS          I only have one question.                         JOHN          What's that, Canuck?                         CHRIS          If we're not on the boat, how come          the ground is moving?                         CHUCK          You think George'll miss the bottle?                         TERRY          We'll blame it on Big Daddy.  He's a          lush.                         MIKE          All I know is if that Viking son of          a bitch puts me on smegma duty one          more time I'm gonna have to run him          through.                         TERRY                  (mimicking)          The "Old Man" likes a tight ship!                         CHARLIE          "If it moves, shoot it..."The rest join in.                         CHUCK          "If it doesn't move, throw it          overboard.  If it's too big to throw          overboard, screw it!"More laughing.                         RICK          You think Old Thunder Nuts will          figure out that we're A.W.O.L.Bill drunkenly imitates the Skipper.                         PHIL          "There is nothing that goes on, on          this boat that I don't know about.          She speaks to me in the night.  So          don't test me.  Not even a          little..."The boys laugh.  On the dune, George shakes his head.                         GEORGE          Immortality.                         SKIPPER          Spirits have a way of bringing that          out.                         GEORGE          And being sixteen.                         SKIPPER          They're in a hurry to grow up.  They          don't know about consequences or          responsibility.  That's being          sixteen too.                  (beat)          I promise you one thing...                         GEORGE          What's that?                         SKIPPER          They'll know about it in the          morning.Skipper smiles.EXT.  BEACH - NIGHTThe drunken crew stumble out of the woods onto the beach.As they ready the boat for the trip back Robin looks outto sea...                         ROBIN                  (alarmed)          Jesus H. Christ.Tod looks up.                         TERRY          What now pork chop?                         ROBIN          Look!The guys turn their gaze to the ocean.  The Albatross...is gone!                         TERRY          Holy shit!  Where'd she go?The crew is suddenly stone sober.  Stunned.                         CHARLIE          What the hell is going on?                         MIKE          She's gone!  The boat's gone!!Phil breaks into sort of a blind panic.                         PHIL          Oh Jesus, oh Jesus.  Man I knew we          shouldn't have gone.  I tried to          tell you.  I tried to tell you.  You          guys made me come!  You made me          come!!                         JOHN          Will you shut up?  You sound like my          fucking sister.                         CHUCK          Alright.  Everybody just stay cool.          We'll figure this out.                         MIKE          Who the hell checked the mooring?                         ROBIN          I did.  Why?                         CHARLIE          Maybe she pulled free...                         MIKE          What if they don't know.  If she's          adrift, if they're asleep, she could          run aground.  She could break up on          the reef.                         PHIL                  (to Robin)          Maybe you didn't check it good          enough.                         ROBIN                  (defensive,                   frightened)          I did.  I swear.Oddly, it's Phil who stands up for Robin.                         PHIL          Yeah, well you're really gonna have          some bad dreams if we find out you          didn't.                         JOHN          That's enough.                         PHIL          How the hell are we gonna get outta          here?                         JOHN          We'll think of something.                         PHIL          Oh, praise the lord.                  (announcing)          Relax everybody.  Everything is          under control.  The jug head's going          to think of something.Without warning.  John lunges at Phil.  Phil screams,trying to defend himself.  The guys all dive in.  Suddenlyit's an all out brawl.John out of control pounding Phil's head against the seatof the boat.Suddenly, from behind, comes a blistering "THWACK!!" asChuck breaks an oar over the back of John's head.Stunned, John lets go of Phil and turns, blood drippingfrom the back of his head.                         JOHN          Nobody calls me an idiot.He weaves, then passes out, falling face down in the sand.The guys stagger to their feet, trying to recover.                         PHIL          God damn it man.  I think he broke          my nose!                         CHUCK          Shut up, Phil.Chuck tosses the broken oar handle, kneels over andvomits.                         TERRY          Well that's just great.  Now what          are we supposed to do?Chuck and Robin hoist John up and drag him under a palmtree, propping him up.  The others huddle to stay warm.EXT.  BEACH - MORNINGThe crew's asleep in the tropical heat of day.  Bloodiedand sun burned.  A fly buzzes around Rick's face, wakinghim.  He sits up sunburned and sore trying to focus.  Hegazes across the water, stupefied.                         RICK          Oh-my-god...The others stir and follow his gaze.  The Albatross sitsin exactly the spot where they left her.                         ROBIN          I'm not sure if this is really good          or really bad.EXT.  ALBATROSS - DAYThe sound of a rod and reel spinning wildly.  George triesto maintain control as the rod nearly jumps out of hishands.                         GEORGE          I got a live one!Skipper, Alice and Bill watch the shoreline as the boyslaunch the long boat into the surf.  George is struggling.A beautiful tarpon leaps out of the water, but Skippernever takes his eyes off of his boys.                         SKIPPER          The thing about fishing George, is          you need to let 'em run some.  Give          'em just enough slack so they don't          break the line.  But at the same          time you've gotta keep enough          tension to wear 'em down, bring 'em          in slowly so they don't really know          they're hooked.Suddenly George's line goes slack.  He nearly falls overbackwards.                         GEORGE          I'll try and remember that.EXT.  DECK - DAYHound dog and hung over, bloodied and burned, the boysstand before Skipper and the others.  Skipper looks darkand angry.                         SKIPPER          You know what a loose cannon is?          'Bout the worst thing that could          happen to a wooden ship.  All it          took was one, crashing around the          deck in a storm... It'd smash          everything in its way, maybe take          out a mast or punch a hole right          through the hull.  Think about it,          just one cannon not tied down, not          anchored, could take a whole 'Man of          War' straight to the bottom.                         MIKE                  (aside)          But we don't have any cannons?Chris jabs him in the ribs.                         CHRIS                  (hushed)          Shut up!Skipper turns and faces them.                         SKIPPER          Now, if the Skipper were smart, if          he could see a storm building, why          he'd cut loose every gun on his          boat.  Even though it would leave          him at a disadvantage in battle,          he'd push 'em into the sea.  Better          chance running for port than risk          the entire ship, his crew.He takes a pause making sure he has their attention forthis part.                         SKIPPER          People are like that sometimes.          They cut loose and before you know          it, they're knocking holes in          everything.  So you gotta ask          yourself if it might not be better          to just put 'em off before they sink          the whole thing.  I mean after all,          you can always get new cannons.He walks back to his place at the rail.                         SKIPPER                  (beat)          I want a tight ship, everybody          shaved and in clean clothes when we          make Curacao.  If it goes well, if          your mid terms are acceptable, I may          reconsider my decision about the          rest of the trip.  That's all.Dejected, the crew goes below.EXT.  DECK - DAYUnder sail.  Skipper stands at the wheel overseeing thecrew taking exams.  Each writes furiously as Alicescribbles problems on the blackboard which hangs from thechart house door.As the boys scratch out the problems, John seemsparalyzed.  He looks over at Phil and copies down hisanswer.  He checks crib notes hidden in his shorts.  Chuckand Robin both see this and exchange looks.INT.  AFT CABIN - DAYJohn makes his way down the narrow corridor towards thehead.  Robin follows.  Chuck drops down the aftcompanionway, intercepting John.                         CHUCK          Where you going?                         JOHN          To take a piss.                         ROBIN          Really?John turns around, surprised, sandwiched.                         JOHN          Yeah, that's right.  You wanna come          in and shake it for me?                         CHUCK          If you're gonna cheat, you might as          well copy off somebody who's gonna          get the answer right.                         JOHN          You've gotta be kidding.  Get the          fuck outta my way!Chuck throws open the Engine Room door and they shove Johninside.                         JOHN          What the hell!!!Chuck manages to pin John.  Robin checks his pockets andcomes up with the crib notes.  Chuck lets go.  Johnsnatches them, ashamed.                         CHUCK          Takin' a piss?John turns away.                         ROBIN          Why, man?                         JOHN          I don't have to listen to this.                         CHUCK          Yes you do, stupid.  Because if you          don't, I'm gonna go right up there          and have a heart to heart with          Skipper and you'll be on the first          plane back to idiotville.John lunges at Chuck, sending them both sprawling.  Robinleaps on top of John.                         ROBIN          Cut it out man!!  Stop it!!!  What's          the matter with you?  If Phil had          caught you he'd have ratted you out          in a second.  You get caught          cheating, you'll get kicked off the          boat.John explodes, tears flowing.                         JOHN          I cheated to get on the boat!!!  All          right?!                         CHUCK          What?He lets go of Chuck and stands up trying to hide hisemotions.                         JOHN          I doctored my grades so I'd make the          cut.  I'm a moron, okay?  You          satisfied?!                         CHUCK          You're not a moron.                         JOHN          Wanna bet?  Takes me half a day to          get through one chapter of Lawford          and I still don't have any idea what          the hell he's talkin' about.  You          know why it takes me so long to          write papers?  because I can't          spell.  While everybody else is          sleeping, I'm in the rack with a          flashlight and a dictionary.John chokes back a sob.                         JOHN          Hell, they even kicked me outa vo-          tech 'cause I couldn't read a slide          rule.                         PHIL          I can show you how to use a slide          rule.The three turn around, startled.                         ROBIN          How long you been standing there?                         PHIL          Long enough.John looks down, resigned.                         JOHN          They were gonna put me into special-          ed this year.  I stole a copy of my          transcript, changed all the grades.          Shit, who am I kidding.  I'll never          pass the boards.                         CHUCK          Listen, you don't cheat, and we'll          make sure you get the grades.  We'll          start a private study group.  Nobody          knows.  You'll ace that test.                         ROBIN          I'm in.They turn and look to Phil, who still shows the tell-tailsigns of their fight.                         PHIL          Me, too.                         JOHN          Why would you do that?                         CHUCK          Because we believe in you.                  (beat)          Because we're your friends.EXT.  CURACAO - HARBOR - DUSKAs a blazing sun sizzles into the western sea, theAlbatross rounds a point and heads towards the docksseveral hundred yards away.  On the dock, the students ofthe school wait.  As soon as the ship is in view, theystart to cheer.  Chuck squints.                         CHUCK          What are they doing?                         ROBIN          I can't make it out?Robin calls up to Phil, who is at the wheelhouse.                         ROBIN          Hey, Phil... Swing up the 'binocs'          and tell us what you see.Phil picks up the binoculars and focuses.                         PHIL                  (puzzled)          They're waving... handkerchiefs or          something.                         RICK          What?                         CHARLIE          Maybe they're surrendering.                         PHIL          Wait a second...Phil lowers the binoculars and turns to Skipper.                         PHIL          They're girls!  They're all girls!Skipper shares a knowing look with Alice.                         TOD          Gimme those.Tod snatches the binoculars.                         TOD          WHHOOOOAAAAA!!!!!!  WOMEN!!!Everyone on board rushes to the port side.  Every singleperson on the dock is a young girl waving a whitehandkerchief.  Spontaneous cheers from the boys.As the 'Big A' pulls to the dock, John and Tod run for thegunnel door and swing it open.  The girls flood the deck.                         BILL          Good morning, ladies.They chatter in Dutch and hurry aboard.  Like wallflowers, Robin, Phil and Chuck stand on top of the charthouse watching utopia unfold before them.                         ROBIN          What are we supposed to talk about?                         PHIL          You've gotta be kidding?                         ROBIN          But, they don't speak English.                         PHIL          There are some things that everybody          does in the same language.

With a running start heswings out over the water...                         PHIL          Yeeee Haaaaa!!He careens back onto the deck and lands in front of twostartled, but impressed girls.  Robin and Chuck applaud.Phil takes a bow.  All hell is breaking loose.Skipper and Alice welcome aboard the headmaster, MS.BOYDE, 50's, dumpy but tough.

CREW TOGETHER          When the sun came up there was          whisky in the cup/ and not one of us          was sober/ Kerry thought she saw a          picture, but it really was the sun/          then we knew the party was over...The weather was perfect, brisk and steady under the tradewind swells.  The voices trail away as the ship moves off.                         OLDER CHUCK (V.O.)          Curacao seemed out of a dream,          somehow make-believe.  But, as Ohio          drew further and further away, it          was home that began to seem unreal,          drifting somewhere in the foggy          reaches of our memories.  And I knew          that each of us was falling in love.          But not only with these wonderful          women or the swaying palms and          porcelain beaches... We were falling          in love with the experience we were          sharing, and with who we were          becoming.INT.  MAIN CABIN - NIGHTThe crew is getting ready for a farewell party.

TOD          Don't mind him, Chucky.  You're          talking to a guy whose idea of big          romance is a palm full of Vaseline.                         TERRY          Screw you, Valentino.  I haven't          seen you swapping spit with anybody.Tod smiles as he slowly pulls something from his pocket.It's a pair of girls' cotton underwear.                         TOD          That's because I'm discrete, moron.The guys try to wrestle the underwear away from him.  Justthen Skipper descends the companionway.

Because I'll see him in a rowboat...                         PHIL          It has nothing to do with him.                         FRANCIS          Well, what does it have to do with?          Us?                         PHIL          No.  Look, it's me okay?  Can't it          just be about me?  For once?Phil pulls free and exits.  He can feel eyes all over him.EXT.

GEORGE          If I didn't know better I'd say the          old man was acting almost halfway          human.                         LAWFORD          He is halfway human.One by one the couples clear for the Skipper and hisbride.  They glide, lost in each others arms.  They dancea dance for the ages.

CHUCK          I can't remember feeling like this          about myself, a place, someone like          you.  We've come such a long way,          seen so much.  But nothing like this.Bregitta smiles and takes Chuck's hand.  He's nervous.                         CHUCK          I'm not the best at expressing          myself.  Maybe the only reason I can          now is because I know you don't          understand me.                  (beat)          I like you so much.  Too much.  But          how could I?  I mean, if we can't          even communicate, how could I know          you?  It's confusing.  We sail in an          hour and I'll never see you again.Bregitta takes Chuck's face gently and kisses himtenderly.  Then, in perfect English...

There are one of twothumps of her tail and, it's over.Skipper tosses the bloody mallet into the locker andapproaches Phil, his face flushed with anger.  He grabsthe spear gun, and snaps it across his knee and throws thepieces into the sea.

Then the impulse passes.                         SKIPPER          That's what I thought.                  (beat)          You're done.  You're going home.Skipper turns.

CHUCK          I mean he has all these expectations          and he doesn't even know who his own          kid is.  What right did then have to          show up here?                         SKIPPER          They have every right Chuck.

SKIPPER          Let me tell you something about          Phil's father, and your's too.  How          do you think you got here?  You          think this is all free, that they          owe you something?  You think they          enjoy riding subways and commuter          trains, driving buses or pulling          lobster traps?  Work fifty weeks a          year to keep you in tennis shoes and          private school?  Look around at how          the rest of the world lives Chuck.          We're the luckiest people alive,          every one of us.  They gave it up          for you and Phil, and me too my          friend.Chuck chews on it.                         SKIPPER          There are ground rules in families          just like on this boat.  If you and          Phil don't like it, I'm sorry.          Someday you'll understand that, and          if you're lucky, you'll come home          and find your best friend has been          there all along waiting for you to          forgive him for being a father.          It'll be the way it used to be,          when you were ten and your dad was a          giant.Now it's Skipper who is talking about himself.

ALICE          We were idealists.                         SKIPPER          Because we believed we could make an          impact out here.

And in the days that          followed the low morale was matched          only by a sense of arrogance that          perhaps the master should step down          and let his students take over.AERIAL SHOTRobin, the Albatross and the drama unfolding below spinslowly away as we climb, turning, higher and higher.EXT.

The Commander signals to one ofhis men who disappears into the Chart House.                         COMMANDER          Perhaps in appreciation for our          country's pursuit of peace, you          might offer us some, token of          gratitude.Skipper doesn't really have a choice.

OLDER CHUCK (V.O.)          We had journeyed over six thousand          miles to the very edge of the earth.          Like Darwin before us, we would          witness the bliss of nature in the          absence of man.  And it was as if          the Albatross had forded time,          leaving it behind.  In the heat of          those equatorial days, on the virgin          onyx beaches and shifting coral          dunes, one could expect to find          sunning iguanas, nesting frigates          and perchance... the footprints of          God.EXT.

Thegoat's eyes are full of a terror it has never known.The beach is broad and long with no cover.  The huntersare gaining on the goat.  Splashing feet pound closer...Suddenly they are upon the goat.  But, instead ofattacking it, they just run through it, passing it.

Taught and powerful,the glistening bodies of young men.Blue sparks leap from striking flint against stone.  Aflame is born.  Voices howl in guttural triumph.As the flames leap and singe the darkness, silhouettes ofmen pound the sand and cry out in a ritualistic dance.The goat watches from the shadows, bemused, as the dancebuilds to a frenzy.  The night sky is filled with thebuilding sound of raging fire, pounding surf and chantingvoices.EXT.

Lawford is trapped in an tiny air pocket.Debris float around.  He begins to panic as the wateraround him rises.                         LAWFORD          My God!!  Oh God I'm dying!!!He takes a deep breath and the water consumes him.  Thensuddenly, the ceiling above him explodes from the pressurewithin.ON THE SURFACELawford is catapulted from the grip of death, to thesurface.EXT.  SURFACE - SAMEChuck continues to frantically dive on the chart housedoor as the ship takes the 'Deep Six'.  Suddenly the shiprolls 180 degrees, her screws exposed and keel jutting uplike a huge dorsal fin.EXT.  UNDERWATER - SAMEChuck feels the ship coming down on top of him but stillfinds Robin's arm.  They clasp tightly, but Chuck justcan't budge the door.  Then, strangely, Robin releasesChuck's arm and pulls it back through the door.  Chucklooks up, startled.  The small round window in the door isilluminated from the cabin lights on the inside.Through the glass, Chuck meets Robin's frightened eyes.He fights to stay in a shrinking air pocket.  Robin takesa last gulp of air then, a calm comes over him.He meets Chuck's eyes again but this time with a strangeacceptance.  They both know what's happening.  But Robinhas refused to take his friend to the bottom with him.  Hepresses his hand to the glass.  Chuck does the same.  Thenwith a smile, Robin pushes himself away from the door,disappearing into the darkness and eternity.EXT.  SURFACE - SAMEChuck breaks the surface, gasping for air.  He looksaround, frantic.  He sees nothing but the sea swells anddebris.  All that remains is the sound of the wind andrain on the water.Suddenly, beneath him, a massive rumbling and explosion offoam.  Then, the tops of twin masts rise out of the waterlike shattered lances as the ship rights herselfunderwater.  She holds herself steady for a moment as ifin a final attempt at resurrection, the Albatross beginsto rise.  Faster and faster, until her entire lengthexplodes out of the water in a mountain of foam and wave.ON THE DECKLike Ahab before him, John appears, lashed in a web oftangled line still slashing to free the remaining longboat.And for a moment, it looks as if she might stay there, asif this were just a final surreal lesson of the sea.  Someof the boys begin to cheer prematurely.  But Skipper knowsbetter.  She's filled to the gills with sea water.She shutters.  Then, like a stone, she just drops, suckedto the center of the earth, John's hands still slashing,as she finally goes.PULL BACK TO REVEALSurvivors hanging onto the debris that floats in thewatery tempest.  Strangely, the wind subsides.  The seabecomes calm and a stunned silence falls over those in thewater.                         CHUCK          OH GOD!!!!!His scream echoes, for the grief of all.ON THE SURFACEThere is an explosion of bubbles, and then she slipsbeneath the waves like a stone.  The stunned crew can onlywatch.Then, as if by magic, the second life boat erupts to thesurface.Skipper fights off his emotions.  He knows what it means.John died cutting it free.Terry and Bill hang onto a life ring.  Blood runs fromBill's head.  Charlie, Mike and several others hold ontothe side of the other freed life boat which has beenswamped.  Lawford floats on his back, unconscious, butalive.  Several of the boys help pull him towards theboat.Skipper swims to the second boat, desperately looking forthose not accounted for.  But, they are gone.Among the wreckage, the roof of the chart house.  The onlysound left is the ominous tolling of the ship's bell,Robin's bell, still secure in it's fitting.EXT.  LIFE BOAT - DAYThe boats have been floated and tied together.  Skipper isin one, Lawford in the other.  One of the two boats hasbeen rigged with sail.

BILL          Maybe we could wait around a little          longer, sir...There is a long pause before Skipper answers.                         SKIPPER                  (quietly)          She's gone... She's gone.There is something remarkably touching about this youngman trying to take care of him.  He puts a hand onSkipper's shoulder.  It almost makes him crack.  He patsBill's hand gently.                         SKIPPER          Carry on.                         BILL          Yes sir.                         SKIPPER          North, north-east.                  (beat)          And Dick, please make a note of our          final position.Lawford nods sullenly.  Chuck looks out at the floatingwreckage around them, silent, lost.Suddenly, there is a 'thump' on the hull of the boat.  Thesurvivors share a confused look.  Then it comes again.Chuck looks out at the surface of the water.  It'ssuddenly alive... With sharks.                         LAWFORD          Hands and feet inside the boats.They come by the dozens.  Ramming the boats and rummagingthrough the debris.  They swarm around the boats until itseems as if the water is boiling.  Chuck picks up an oarand starts beating wildly at the sharks.                         CHUCK          AAAAHHHH!!!!The others take up the cause and in a moment they are allscreaming and cursing the sharks.  It's a frenzy of griefand anger.                         OLDER CHUCK (V.O.)          We slashed at the sharks as if          striking out at the finger of God.          And we all begged silently for the          ability to understand what had          happened.  But, if there was a God          that day, his answer came only in          the moaning wind and our questions          were left to drift unanswered, in          the titanic ocean of our deepest          grief.Exhausted, Chuck stops slashing and stares out.  lost.

TERRY          Then whose?Tod looks up along with Bill and Charlie, all confused.                         TERRY          After the lightning strike, we tried          to go aloft to drop sail.  We'd done          it a thousand times.  We didn't have          to wait for an order.  But Skipper          called us down.                         CHARLIE          If the foremast had taken a strike,          everyone in the rigging would've          been fried.  What would you have          done?                         TERRY          We would have scalloped the squares          from the deck.  Right Bill?Bill turns and stares into the water, troubled.                         TOD          That's right, that's right!  Bleed          the sails from the deck and she          could've taken a hurricane!It's a strong argument.  Even Charlie is troubled by theimplication.  There is a long moment of silence betweenthem.                         CHUCK          This is crazy.  Nothing could have          prevented what happened.                         MIKE          You guys are missing the point.          This is all because of Phil.  Phil          and his dear old dad.                         BILL          What?                         MIKE          How do you think they got this          together so fast?  He's been laying          for Skipper since the first day.                         CHARLIE          Come on.  Like he's got a vendetta          or some such shit?                         MIKE          You got it.                  (to Chuck)          I told you he was a turn coat the          day we kicked him off the boat.Chuck frowns, troubled.                         CHUCK          No.  You're wrong.                         MIKE          I'm telling you, the only way to          change this is to get Phil to call          off his old man.  And that ain't          gonna happen.  So the way I see it,          it's Skipper or us.The guys react.  It's a no win situation.EXT.  MOTEL - NIGHTChuck knocks quietly on the door.  Phil answers the door.                         CHUCK          Can we talk?                         PHIL          I guess.                         FRANCIS (O.S.)          Who is it Philip?                         PHIL          It's okay.  I'll be in, in a minute.                  (to Chuck)          Look, what do you want?                         CHUCK          Everybody's saying this whole          tribunal is happening because of          your father.  Because of you.                         PHIL          Well that's just typical isn't it?                         CHUCK          Is it true Phil?                         PHIL          I gotta go.                         CHUCK          You weren't there, you don't know          what happened.                         PHIL                  (defensive)          I know enough.Chuck puts a hand out to stop him.                         CHUCK          Phil, please.  It won't change          anything.  Tell him to call it off.                         FRANCIS (O.S.)          Who are you talking to out there          Philip.  Come back in here.Phil meets Chuck's eyes, then looks away.                         PHIL          I'm sorry.He turns again and reaches for the door.                         CHUCK          Wait.Chuck hands him something.  Phil looks down, disbelieving.It's the ship's bell.  Robin's bell.  Their symbol ofunity, of putting loyalty above fear.                         CHUCK          We figured he'd have wanted you to          have it.                  (beat)          You do what you've gotta do Phil.He leaves Phil standing alone on the porch, full ofemotion, trying to grasp it all.INT.  HEARING ROOM - DAYA small courtroom.  The room is filled with the crewmembers and their families, including the parents of thevictims, as well as the media.  Phil sits with his fatherand dodges Chuck's eyes.  Coast Guard Officers Tyler,DOWNING and SANDERS head the proceedings.                         TYLER          The United States Coast Guard has          been asked to conduct this maritime          hearing to consider the revocation          of Captain Richard Sheldrake's U.S.          Master Seaman's Certificate.INT.  HEARING ROOM - LATERBill sits at the table with his parents as questions areleveled at him.  Chief petty officers Sanders and Downingask most of the questions as Tyler oversees theproceedings.                         SANDERS          Why didn't you drop any sail?                         BILL          Skipper called us out of the          rigging.                         SANDERS          But your instinct was to lose sail?                         BILL          My instinct was to not get          electrocuted.                         SANDERS          How old are you, son?                         BILL                  (hesitating)          Fifteen.                         SANDERS          Thank you.LATERPhil is at the table with Francis.  Sanders asks thequestions.                         SANDERS          Philip, why were you discharged from          the Albatross?Phil doesn't look up and speaks in whispers.                         PHIL          Skipper thought I was a challenge to          authority.                         SANDERS          Were you?                         PHIL          I don't know.LATER                         FRANCIS          Captain Sheldrake exhibited an          arrogant, controlling attitude in my          presence on more than one occasion.          I believe he had a personality          conflict with my son from the start.                         SANDERS          Well, if you don't mind my asking,          sir, why did you let your son stay?Francis is stumped for a moment but recovers quickly.                         FRANCIS          It was his dream to go.  I could          hardly stand in the way of that,          could I?Phil rubs his temples as if he is going to explode.INT.  HEARING ROOM - LATERIt is Skipper's turn at the table.                         SANDERS          Is it true that you forced Robin          Weathers to climb the mast when it          was clear that he was acrophobic.                         SKIPPER          He climbed when he was ready.                         SANDERS          Were you aware that his brother was          killed in a fall.Chuck and the others look up astonished.  Mike shoots alook towards Phil.                         MIKE          He did it man.  He sang like a bird.Skipper hesitates.                         SKIPPER          Yes, I was.Whispers fill the room.                         SANDERS          Sir, were you aware at any time of          the use of alcohol among the crew.                         SKIPPER          Yes, I was.                         TYLER          And you didn't do anything about it?                         SKIPPER                  (beat)          No.  I didn't.Again the crew members are struck.  Charlie turns toChuck.                         CHARLIE          They're twisting it all around.  Why          doesn't he say something?                         SANDERS          Had you ever seen a "White Squall"          before this incident?                         SKIPPER          No.                         SANDERS          What makes you so sure it was one?                         SKIPPER          I can't be sure.                         SANDERS          You really felt that your crew were          up for the conditions.                         SKIPPER          We'd come twelve thousand miles          together, through every kind of seas          imaginable...                         SANDERS          Except, a "White Squall".                  (beat)          With all due respect Captain          Sheldrake, they're only boys...                         SKIPPER          They are much more than that, sir.                         SANDERS          Is it true that the reason you          expelled Philip Boutillier...                         SKIPPER                  (cutting him off)          For killing a dolphin.                         SANDERS          ... and that you invited him to          strike you?  To fight it out on the          deck of your ship?!Skipper looks over at Francis.  Phil stares at the floor.Skipper manages an ironic smile.                         SKIPPER          Yes, that's true.                         SANDERS          Do you think this is funny?  Some          kind of joke?  You lost six people          out there.                         SKIPPER                  (white hot)          I don't think one second of this is          funny, sir.Skipper stares down Sanders.  He turns to Tyler.                         SANDERS          I have no more questions at this          time.He turns to sit down, then stops.                         SANDERS          Oh, one last thing... Isn't true          that your father was a sea Captain?Skipper bristles.                         SKIPPER          Yes.                         SANDERS          Isn't also true that his vessel went          down off of Nantucket?  Lost          everyone on board.  In fair weather          no less.Skipper's silence is suddenly filled with rage.  Tylersees it and tries to intercept.                         TYLER          What does this have to do with          anything Mr. Sanders?                         SANDERS                  (smug)          Oh, nothing.  I was just curious.                         SKIPPER          My father, was more seaman, more of          a man, than you might ever hope to          be.Sanders returns to his seat, rattled.  Tyler pounds hisgavel.                         TYLER          We'll take a brief recess.EXT.  BUILDING - DAYThe crew huddle in the parking lot.  Fractured, confused.Chuck, Tod, Charlie and Bill, stand off by themselves.                         TOD          There's still a way.                         BILL          What do you mean?                         TOD          It's me, don't you see.  Terry's          right, I'm the escape hatch.  I          disobeyed order.                         CHUCK          You taking the order wouldn't have          changed anything.                         TOD          They don't know that.                  (beat)          We were the only one's on deck.          Look, there's nothing they can do to          me right?  I'm a kid.                         CHUCK          But that's not the point...                         TOD          That is the point... And Skipper'll          slip off the hook.LATERTod is on the stand.                         DOWNING          Why didn't you turn hard to port as          the wind hit?                         TOD          I thought we'd have a better chance          if I headed into the wind so we          could spill air from our sails.Tyler removes his glasses.                         DOWNING          But the Captain ordered you hard to          starboard.                         TOD          Twice.                         DOWNING          Is that what you were trained to do?                         TOD          No.                         DOWNING          Then what do you think he was trying          to do.                         TOD          Let the blow drive the boat down          wind.  Neutralize our canvas.Skipper is becoming uneasy.  He sees what is coming.                         DOWNING          So when the captain gave you an          order contrary to your training, you          thought he was making a mistake?                         TOD          No.                         TYLER          Then why son, why didn't you follow          his order?Tod meets Skipper's eyes.                         TOD          Because -- I panicked.The room is suddenly buzzing.  Tod's Father stands up.                         TOD'S FATHER          That's not true Tod.                         TERRY                  (to Mike)          What the hell?  What is he doing.                         MIKE          Son of a gun.  He just sent Skipper          a life boat.Tyler turns to Skipper.                         TYLER          If this young man had responded          instantly to your command, do you          believe the ship might have been          spared?                         SKIPPER          I don't know that anything could          have prevented what happened.                         TYLER          Then what are you trying to say          then?Skipper stands.                         SKIPPER          Maybe you can't see what's happening          here, but it's clear to me.                  (to Tod)          I appreciate what you're trying to          do Tod.  Maybe you could live with          it, but I couldn't.                  (to tribunal)          If you think I'm going to let a          sixteen year old take          responsibility, then you          underestimate me.  The Albatross was          my ship.  The Ocean Academy was my          school.  Her loss is mine and mine          alone.                  (to others)          I can't bring your sons back.  If          you want my ticket, if that will          ease your loss, it's the least I          can do.  This...Skipper pulls out his wallet and takes out his license.                         SKIPPER          This is easy.  Living with it,          that'll be hard.Skipper turns and lays his license down in front of Tyler.Then he turns and begins walking towards the back of theroom.The room erupts.  Crew members and their families hurlaccusations and blame.  Cameras flash.  Tyler tries toregain control.  Suddenly Chuck stands, tall.                         CHUCK          No!!!  Don't you walk away!  Not          now.  Not after all of this!!!!Skipper keeps walking.  His head slumps.  Tyler pounds hisgavel.                         TYLER          That enough son!!  Order!!  Please!!Tears begin to stream down Chuck's face.  His father,Charles, slowly stands meeting his sons eyes.  Go for it.                         CHUCK          Tell me Skipper, was it all just a          lie?  "Where we go one, we go all".          We listened to you.  We believed it.          And we're still here!!Skipper keeps moving.                         CHUCK          Shame on you then Skipper.  Shame on          you.Skipper reaches for the door.  Suddenly a sound stops himcold in his tracks.  Phil slowly rises.  Tears streamingdown his face.  Tightly in his hands he grips the shipsbell.  Ding ding.  Ding ding.  Ding ding.  It is theringing of the truth.  The tolling of their unity.                         FRANCIS          Sit down!Phil ignores him.  Skipper slowly walks over, his eyesnever leaving Phil's.  He stops, facing him.  He gentlytakes his hands and silences the bell.  Then he smiles andputs a hand on the back of Phil's head fighting his ownemotions.  He turns to Chuck.                         CHUCK          Tell them the truth.  Make them          understand.The room grows silent.                         SKIPPER                  (smiling)          You tell them Chuck.Chuck suddenly feels the eyes of the room.                         CHUCK          It's simple.  Bad things happen          sometimes.  It wasn't Skipper or          Tod.  It was all of us.  Everyone in          this room.  Because we all knew the          risks.                  (to parents)          You sent us... You paid our tuition,          you allowed us to go.  So to invent          a reason for why this happened, to          pin it on one person, well that          won't change anything.  It'll just          make our experience meaningless.He turns to the tribunal.                         CHUCK          If you want to judge this man, judge          him by his crew.  Judge him by Alice          and George.  Chris and John and          Robin.  In one way or another each          one of them gave their lives saving          one of us.  This may sound crazy but          the Albatross wasn't just a ship, or          even a school.  It was something          that we made, that's inside us.          That's who Skipper is.  That's what          he taught us.  I guess what it          really was about was... the          privilege of sacrifice.Chuck turns to Skipper.                         CHUCK          Isn't that right?Skipper nods.                         SKIPPER          That's right.The room is silent.  Then, a voice.  A golden tenorsinging like the wind.  Everyone turns.  It's Bill.                         BILL          When the sun came up, there was          whisky in the cup, and not a one of          us was sober...One by one the crew members stand and begin to sing.Chuck turns, surprised to see his father rise and standwith him.  Words or not.                         CREW TOGETHER          Jenny thought she saw a picture when          it really was the sun, then we knew          the party was over.They all stand facing Skipper and sing.  The voices build,sweeping over everyone like a wave.                         CREW TOGETHER          Oh my heart is sad, for leaving you          today, but I know we'll meet again,          when the moon is in the valley and          the leafs are on the trees, We will          come to clearly in the glen...Skipper meets Chuck's eyes and those of his mates.  Onlynow is his job finished.  He beams back.  The music swellslike an anthem, building, like a swell lifting a smallwooden boat over a jagged reef, until it rests safely inthe calm waters beyond.The crew come together around Skipper one last time.  Theyembrace.EXT.  MYSTIC SEAPORT - HARBOR - DAYOlder Chuck has returned to the small building where thefuneral services were held earlier.  The people have gonebut the funeral urn remains.EXT.  PIER - DAYChuck walks to the dock.  He has the funeral urn in hishands.  He steps aboard a small sailboat and beginsuntying her.  The HARBOR MASTER notices and steps out ofhis office.                         HARBOR MASTER          What do you think you're doing.He walks over to the dock.                         HARBOR MASTER          All right friend, out of the boat.He tries to board the boat but Chuck greets him with thesharp end of a gaffing hook.                         OLDER CHUCK                  (softly)          Stand away.He looks into Chuck's eyes and sees that he meansbusiness.  He backs off.  Chucks pushes away and raisesthe sail.  The harbor master watches, perplexed as thesmall boat moves off for open water.EXT.  OPEN SEA - SUNSETBathed in the orange glow of the sun, Chuck stands nakedagainst the ivory sail.                         OLDER CHUCK (V.O.)          They didn't take his ticket that          day.  But why he never returned to          the sea, I'd never know.  Perhaps he          hadn't been able to free himself          from the anchor of grief that had          driven him to his knees aboard the          Gran Rio, or that he no longer cared          for the solitude and isolation of          command without his Alice.  Or maybe          it was just that the waves that had          spoken to him for so long, had grown          silent.  Whatever it was, that          thing, it had always troubled me.          Because, fate offers up no reasons.          And maybe that's what I have          traveled these thirty four years to          say.  Maybe that is all I really          know... And, that one man cared.Chuck turns to the sea and speaks.                         OLDER CHUCK          Rest easy old salt.  For together          again, we'll sail.With a powerful heave, he hurls the Skipper's remains atthe sinking sun and into the arms of Neptune.                                            DISSOLVE TO:EXT.  BEACH - SUNSETThe same sunset, but from another time.  Four young menwalk along a deserted beach.  A small boat has beached androcks gently in the shallows.  The boys run up and look atit.  On the stern are painted the words:  BRIGANTINEALBATROSS.SLOWLY PULL BACK to reveal endless white sand, blue water,the young men and the boat.                         OLDER CHUCK (V.O.)          Some time later we learned that one          of our long boats had been          recovered.  Several young men found          it washed up on a nameless beach          somewhere on the island of          Hispaniola.  No one seemed to know          who they were or where they came          from, but they seemed to know of the          Albatross.                  (pause)          Sometimes in my dreams those          faceless young men reveal themselves          as my lost companions, and on the          twilight coral sands of forever,          between my slumber and conscious          state, we race naked again, so open          and in love with those precious          moments, running, ever laughing,          ever young, ever free.
