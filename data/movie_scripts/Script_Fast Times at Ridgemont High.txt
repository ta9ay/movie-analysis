STACY Thanks for getting rid of those flowers. BRAD Don't worry about it. Who sent the flowers? STACY It's just some guy I met at Swenson's. You don't know him. BRAD I don't care it you tell me or not. I got problems of my own.He begins pacing. STACY Is everything okay at work? BRAD Are you kidding? Work is great. I kill at work.

What is it that gets inside your heads?Mr. Hand begins to pace the aisles as he speaks.Occasionally, for emphasis, he bends down tolecture directly into the students' faces. MR. HAND (CONT'D) There are other teachers in this school who look the other way at truants. (points to attendance clip on the doorway) It's a little game that you both play. They pretend they don't see you, you pretend you don't ditch. Who pays the price later? You.Desmond returns to the room with a red-eyed JeffSpicoli. SPICOLI Hey! Wait a minute! There's no birthday party for me here! MR. HAND Thank you, Desmond. (to Spicoli) What's the reason for your truancy? SPICOLI I couldn't make it in time. MR. HAND (in top form) You mean, you couldn't? Or you wouldn't? SPICOLI I don't know, mon. The food lines took forever. MR. HAND Food will be eaten on your time! (pause) Why are you continuously late for this class, Mr. Spicoli?

He writes in long, largeletters as he slams the chalk into the green board.He writes: "I DON'T KNOW". MR. HAND I like that.He stands back and admires it. He turns randomly toStacy. MR. HAND (CONT'D) Don't you like that, Miss Hamilton? STACY Yes, sir. MR. HAND I really like that too. 'I don't know'... that's nice. 'Mr. Hand, will I pass this class?' 'Gee, Mr. Spicoli, I don't know'. I like that. I think I'm going to leave your words on this board for all my classes to enjoy. Giving you full credit, of course, Mr. Spicoli.We hear the blare of the dismissal bell. Stacy andthe other students get up to leave. Spicoli staysin place. He has just figured out a truly bitchin'comeback... and his mouth is forming the firstword, when Mr. Hand cuts him off. MR. HAND (CONT'D) You can go now.Hand turns back to his desk. The rest of thestudents have already left. Spicoli's audience isgone. He shrugs and lopes out the door.INT.

STACY Will you unzip me?ANGLE ON THE RAT'S FACEas the wheels inside his mind start to spin. Thiscan't be what it seems. He unzips Stacy, past herbra, down to the small of her back. It's the firsttime he's ever done anything like that. STACY (CONT'D) Thanks!She walks down the hall to her room, easing out ofher dress as she walks. She leaves the door to herroom open.

STACY Do you want to see some pictures? I kept a lot of scrapbooks and pictures and stuff from junior high. How stupid, right? THE RAT Sure.Stacy goes to her closet, reaches up to grab thebooks from the top shelf. The Rat watches her robeslip up her legs. Then she sits down next to him.Her knee grazes his. It is almost too much for TheRat. Go for it. We see The Rat struggle with theaction of putting his arm around her. He almostdoes, but then reacts as she says suddenly... STACY This is me in the eighth grade. Did you have Mr. Deegan? THE RAT (looking pained) Oh, yeah. I had Mr. Deegan.Her knee grazes him again. Does she expectsomething? THE RAT (CONT'D) Look, Stacy, I want you to know that...The Rat struggles. Try as he might, he can't seemto cross the line. He can't make his move. He iswoeful as he completes the sentence. THE RAT (CONT'D) ... I've got to go home. STACY Do you really have to go? THE RAT Well... it's getting kind of late.Suddenly, The Rat is seized with ambition. Hereaches one hand around her right shoulder andplants the other hand directly on her left breast.It looks something like a wrestling hold. The Ratlooks at Stacy. Stacy looks back at The Rat. TheRat is absolutely frozen. STACY I guess it is getting late, Mark.She shrugs him off, walks him to the door.EXT. THE HAMILTON HOME - NIGHTWe see The Rat's forlorn face as he trudges towardshis car.

SPICOLI (CONT'D) With a genuine Mustang steering wheel, you can negotiate a hairpin turn with ease, my man.EXT./INT. MUSTANGon the word "ease", Spicoli curls his finger intoone of the Mustang steering wheel bubbles and whipsit clockwise. The idea is to turn off onto a sidestreet and head back to the party. But instead, atthe moment of the hairpin turn, L.C. is attemptingto switch the radio station. Spicoli crooks hisfinger farther into the bubble than he expected.The car swings in a complete circle, a circle thatincludes a bright yellow fire hydrant. The hydrantrips the side of the car open like a can of tuna.There is a silent moment of terror. SPICOLI Are you okay?There is silence. Outside the smashed car, theGranada Jocks pass Spicoli and L.C.

They are listening to themusic of Tom Petty's "Breakdown" playing on theliving room stereo. Linda luxuriously appliessuntan lotion to her chest and legs, in long andwrithing strokes. Stacy reads a book. It's calledTotal Orgasm. Several beats pass. LINDA I sent a letter to Doug today. I'll be so glad when he gets out here. STACY (engrossed in book) You really ought to look at this, Linda. There's a drawing on every page... and all these quizzes. It's like school. LINDA Why don't you put your mother's secret book back?Linda continues regally applying lotion. STACY Listen to this... 'What are your mate's three most erogenous zones?' LINDA (automatic) Okay, penis, that's one, balls... STACY Wouldn't penis and balls be the same category? LINDA You're right. Probably penis, mouth and neck. STACY All right! Here's another one. 'The most satisfactory lovemaking occurs when your mate climaxes first, you climax first, you and your mate climax together?' LINDA Climax together. STACY Does that ever happen? LINDA No. But it's a nice idea. STACY Listen to this ... it says 'Most women derive pleasure from sex, but they don't have real orgasms.'Linda stops applying lotion, considers thatthought.

LINDA I think they're both virgins.Stacy smiles, gets up and goes over to the fence. STACY I didn't ask for any help. Did you, Linda?

He is just out ofearshot when they begin talking about him. LINDA God, he hardly even talks anymore. STACY I know. He hates to have to wear uniforms. DAMONE Poor guy.

SCHOOL BUS - DAYThe bus pulls up to the front entrance ofUniversity Hospital. The students file out andcollect next to the front door. Mr. Vargasgleefully addresses the class. This is his favoritefield trip. MR. VARGAS Today we're going to explore how this hospital works to preserve human life. We'll be visiting every floor, every level where these fine doctors and nurses take care of us, in life... and in death.INT. MATERNITY WARDThe class exits from a hospital elevator, ontoanother floor. They are now standing outside thematernity ward. We hear the loud noise of babies. MR. VARGAS Over thirty children are delivered here each day...The class moves on.INT. THE BOTTOM FLOORThe class exits another hospital elevator. MR. VARGAS This is part of your third quarter exam, and I'd advise you to take careful notes on what we're about to see.ANGLE ON DR. MILLERa young intern who has joined the class for thelast part of their tour. MR. VARGAS May I just ask you one last time to conduct yourselves with the utmost maturity...The kids are beginning to get very nervous now asthey are led down the hall to the "Cold Room." Thedoor to the "Cold Room" has only one sign on it. Itreads: CADAVERS -- MEDICAL EXAMINATION ONLY. Mr.Vargas opens the door, and the class seems to gasp.INT. THE COLD ROOMThere are six examination tables in the "ColdRoom". Each of them contains a cadaver covered by awhite sheet. Mr. Vargas has gathered the classaround one table in particular. He fingers the edgeof the white sheet as he talks. MR. VARGAS As you know, all the bodies in this room are recently deceased human bio-structures.A student raises his hand. MR. VARGAS Yes, Randy? RANDY Who are these guys? MR. VARGAS Most of them were derelicts, Randy. They sold the right for medical examination of their bodies for money. Something like thirty dollars, I believe. Isn't that right, Doctor Miller? DR. MILLER Twenty-five dollars.ANGLE ON JEFF SPICOLIwho turns to Stacy. SPICOLI Twenty-five bucks is pretty good. MR. VARGAS Now this gentleman here is named Arthur. Arthur died from heart failure last week and we are fortunate enough to view his body in its pristine state.Mr. Vargas suddenly pulls the white sheet aside andwe see the body of Arthur. The students' eyeswiden. Some gasp. Others cover their mouths. Othersbegin furious notes. Nobody speaks. The body ofArthur is smallish and withered. It is orange,flaky, and not quite real looking. A deep cut hasbeen made in Arthur's chest.Mr. Vargas bends Arthur upright for a betterstudent view. He gestures to the deep cut made inArthur's chest.The tension mounts. MR. VARGAS (CONT'D) This incision allows us to pull aside the skin covering of the chest cavity and really observe the human organs as they exist in their natural state.ANGLE ON ARTHURand his shrunken face, which seems to say pleasedon't. MR. VARGAS (CONT'D) I want all of you to take a look at the chest cavity for just a moment.Mr. Vargas grabs the two sides of Arthur's chestcavity covering, and rips it open. MR. VARGAS (CONT'D) Here we have the human lungs and heart, which you can see is actually located in the center of your chest.With a squish, Mr. Vargas reaches inside Arthur andpulls out the human heart for display.

He's an asshole. I hate him. LINDA But it costs money to have an abortion. Even at the Free Clinic. You tell Damone to pay for it. It's the least he can do. It's the guy's responsibility too.She puts the TV back on and they watch. STACY You know, there's one thing you didn't tell me about guys. LINDA What?
