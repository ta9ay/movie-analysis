Gangs of New York 	Gangs of New York       by Jay Cocks, Steven Zaillian, Kenneth Lonergan.      3rd Draft (1993).      More info about this movie on imdb.comINT. ROOM OLD BREWERY DAY Half in shadow, a man named VALLON, dressed in black, fastens a cleanwhite clerical collar around his thick neck. He raises a jagged razor tohis face, RAKES it across his right cheek, drawing BLOOD. He does notflinch.The sharp SCRAPING of the jagged blade against skin is the first SOUND wehear.VALLON cuts himself similarly on the left cheek, then hands the razorceremoniously to a BOY standing beside him. The boy, no more than twelveyears old, looks at VALLON worshipfully, keen eyes shining with fear andexcitement. He starts to wipe the razor blade on the bottom of his jacket.VALLONNo. Never. The blood stays on the blade, son.He hands the boy a dark red velvet pouch. Very carefully, the boy, knownas AMSTERDAM, wraps the razor up, hands it back to his father.From the shadows, VALLON now raises a long pole with a beautiful goldencrucifix mounted on the end, then holds his free hand out to his son.Amsterdam squeezes tight.VALLON nods toward the door. Amsterdam pulls it open. Outside is a dimhallway. We hear SOUNDS that might be animal or human.MUSIC begins: a steady, driving cadence somewhere between a march and ahymn.CUT TO2 INT. HALLWAYVALLON strides in long measured steps. Amsterdam has trouble keeping upwith him.They are walking down a long corridor that's like a tunnel. Patches ofLIGHT stain the darkness. Sometimes Amsterdam glimpses a FACE peering outfrom the gloom. Once or twice he almost stumbles over a BODY stretchedacross his path.CUT TO3 INT. ROOMAnother room, even smaller. The only decoration is a bizarre rendering ofa Madonna and child painted on the wall.A beefy man picks up a home-made PIKE, its iron tip sharpened to a lethalpoint. He is smiling. The grin is huge, but cockeyed. It occupies onlyhalf of his face. The grotesque, unending grin is the result of facialparalysis, and has given him a nickname: HAPPY JACK MULRANEY.Jack lifts the pike carefully, then takes a candle from the wall and bendsdown over a wooden cage full of rabbits. He slowly moves the candle backand forth across the cage top. Wax falls on the cage, splattering anunlucky rabbit.Jack thrusts the pike between the wooden bars, impaling the rabbit's body.He pulls the pike from the cage and leaves.CUT TO4 INT. HALLWAYJack falls into step beside VALLON and Amsterdam. He holds the pike withthe dead rabbit high, next to VALLON's cross.HAPPY JACKDid you bring the boy for a charm, Priest?VALLONNo, Jack. For a baptism.Now a WOMAN joins them. She's dressed in man's clothes, her pants held upby suspenders. She wears a set of IRON CLAWS.MUSIC builds, growing more insistent and more ominous.Now a figure looms before them. Over his street clothes, this WARRIORwears a rig of home-made armor made from fracgments of steel, lengths ofchain and bits of leather. He carries a battle-axe as lightly as if itwere a twig.RABBIT WARRIORWe'll send a few across the river today, Priest.He joins the procession. Another woman, as tough as the first and halfagain as large, and several more men, all armed with implements ofdestruction, fall in beside him. Their faces are marked with blood, likeVallan's, or covered with ritual markings made with paint and ink.The group grows ever larger and more forbidding. occasionally PEOPLE dartaround them in the tunnel and scamper out of their way like animalsfrightened in a burrow.CUT TO5 INT. ROOMVast and dank, like a cavern. We start CLOSE on...... the body of a dead rat being filled with some pieces of lead.Then a little WIDER to reveal: an eager boy, SHANG DRAPER, about the sameage as Amsterdam. He drops the last few pieces of lead into the mouth ofthe rat, then sews it closed. He hefts the animal by the tail, swinging itas he stands up.He is near a primitive forge where a half-drunk SLACKSMITH hammers crudeweapons into shape and distributes them to OTHER MEN and WOMEN. The flooris covered with bits of lead and steel, which Shang has been using to sewinto his rat.Shang FOLLOWS the crowd of men and women with their weapons. And now wesee this room full. It is huge: the main room of the Old Brewery, crowdedwith families huddled together for warmth and comfort, or out of fear; menand women, together or separately, drunk or passed out. They are like zooanimals in a pit. There are sticks of furniture jammed in corners, or,more often, arranged at angles in the middle of the room to form tinyenclaves where the ancient brewery machinery forms irregular boundaries.Above Shang's head, VALLON and his gang walk across a plank bridge thatspans the room a hundred feet beneath them. Armed men and women from theBrewery are climbing a rope ladder to join them. Shang SCURRIES up afterthem.The men and women from the Brewery fall in behind VALLON and the others inthe lead. Shang SPOTS someone near his own age toward the front:Amsterdam. He presses through the crowd like a hunting dog.SHANGWhat's the fight?AMSTERDAMThe Dead Rabbits against the Native Americans, same as ever. But it'll allbe settled today.SHANGAre you Native or Rabbit?AMSTERDAM(points to rabbit on pike)What do you think?SHANGLooks alright. I'll stand by you, then.CUT TO6 INT. HALLWAYThe group now turns down the last corridor, as dim and long as a tunnel.In the distance, there's a faint glimmer of light and the figure of a MAN(MONK EASTMAN). VALLON stops near the door.VALLONI don't know you.MAN(lightly)I suppose there's to be a fight.VALLON catches the heavy Celtic inflection in the man's voice.VALLONDerry?MANDonnegal. Name's Monk Eastman.VALLONAnd you want to fight, Mr. Eastman?MONKlf there's money in it.VALLONFight for the Natives. They have a proper war chest.MONKWell, I might at that. But I thought I'd ask you first, seeing as how I'mnot quite a Native American myself.VALLONLet's see your skills, and we'll talk of payment later.MONKFine. But if you like what you see, pay me double.Monk turns to the door with the grace of a dancer and delivers aSHATTERING kick, sending it flying off its hinges. Clear white LIGHTstreams in, and we see Monk Eastman plain for the first time: a huge man,in stature and girth, wearing a small DERBY that intentionally makes hishead look even bigger.VALLON(as the door splinters settle)Stand with us then.CUT TO7 EXT. STREET DAY (WINTER)WINTER WIND blows across a scene as strange and bleak as an alien planet.VALLON, carrying his cross high, steps through the doorway. The OTHERSslowly follow VALLON out of the building, which is three stories high andmaybe a block long. A dilapidated sign identifies it as the 5 PaintsBrewery.It is the tallest structure in the midst of low, squalid SHACKS, windingALLEYS as narrow as a snakels back, and DIRT STREETS filled with ruts, mudand filthy snow. A few PIGS wander forlornly about, rooting for garbage.WASH hangs stiff, in the middle of the square, from a peculiar monumenterected to some forgotten war hero.The Brewery occupies one side of a SQUARE surrounded by some storefrontsand a couple of collapsed wooden sidewalks. If this place resemblesanything at all, it's a horrible hybrid of London's Limehouse and apioneer town in the American West whose best days have long passed--ornever came at all.VALLON stands still, staring across the square past the monument. Hisbattalion of irregulars waits for his signal.Now... very, very slowly...from around both sides of the monument comesANOTHER GANG, in size the same as VALLON's, men and women both, armed likeVisigoths with HOMEMADE WEAPONS: knives, pitchforks, building blocks andbricks, boards with sharp nails protruding from the ends. Every member ofthis second group is dressed in a long DUSTER which reaches to the ankles.Several MEN in front of the group sport dusters made of leather.VALLONBill Poole! on whose challenge are we assembled?A MAN in a leather duster (BILL THE BUTCHER) steps forward. He is young,lean and fierce. And then there are his eyes. They do not match. One isreal. The other is a huge, bulging PEARL upon which has been engraved,instead of a pupil, a full-color portrait of the AMERICAN EAGLE.On the side of the square, arranged to get a good view of the impendingcombat, is a group of STREET KIDS, girls and boys, none older than eight.They talk and laugh excitedly among themselves, picking their ownfavorites among the gangs as if the warriors were players on a team.BILL THE BUTCHEROn the challenge of the Native Americans, to settle for good and all whoholds sway.VALLONBene.BILL THE BUTCHERBy the ancient laws of combat, we offer our bodies to the ghosts of thosewarriors who have gone before us. Valor is avid for glory, and glory is inour wounds.VALLONBut this time can you bear to look on the glory when it comes, Bill? Canyou see it clear with your single eye?BILL THE BUTCHERWhoever fights untouched in battle has skill, but the warrior who returnswounded has been touched by God.VALLONIt wasn't God who touched your eye.BILL THE BUTCHERIt was God gave me guidance. Will you be able to look on the death blowlike a gladiator, and not look away? No honorable man turns an eye fromhis death.VALLONI don't expect a death blow from your hand, Butcher. Let's have at it.BILL THE BUTCHERThere is another matter.VALLONSay it out and quick, before spring gets here.BILL THE BUTCHERNo Native American Warrior will dishonor himself with the blood of thehalt and maimed.VALLONSo?BILL THE BUTCHERSo we would like to know whether Squire Jack Mulraney of the Dead Rabbitscan smile out of both sides of his face.A pause of a single second. Then HAPPY JACK takes the dead rabbit off thetip of his pike and hurls it across the square. It lands right at BILL THEBUTCHER's feet.In a flash, BILL THE BUTCHER opens his coat. Inside, on a special belt hecarries a CLEAVER, a CARVING KNIFE and other instruments of the butcherlstrade, all stained with blood and gristle. Now the MAN standing next tohim removes the broad BELT from around his coat. The brass buckle issharpened to a point, the leather studded with glass.The gallery of Street Kids tenses for action: they are thrilled.VALLON reaches up to the CROSS, pulls off the top piece, to disclose,underneath, a gleaming sword point. He folds the arms of the cross down,like the blades of a jackknife.VALLONPrepare to receive the Lord.And the air is full of screams and battle cries as the two gangs hurlacross Paradise Square into BATTLE.VALLON draws first blood. He impales a Native American on the sword end ofhis cross and turns to fight again.Amsterdam and Shang exchange a glance of frightened, worried wonder.Then a Native American rushes at them, shouting for blood. The boys acttogether. Amsterdam dives down in front of the man, sending him sprawling.Shang BLUDGEONS the fallen warrior, using his lead-filled rat like ablackjack as Amsterdam kicks him savagely; the Native collapsesunconscicus at their feet. Before the boys can thank one another, however,they are separaten by the SURGING GANGS all around them.BILL THE BUTCHER leaves his meat CLEAVER imbedded in the middle of a man'sskull, then WADES through the combat as if shielded by a charm.The gallery of Street Kids is thrilled by this display and reacts withCHEERS.VALLON BATTLES three Natives who come at him at once.Monk Eastman grabs a Native in his arms like a groom hugging a bride. Heraises his knee and brings the man crashing down across it, BREAKING hisspine like a Thanksgiving wishbone.The gallery of Street Kids is awed by this display of power from a newstar in the making.The Rabbit Warrior in the home-made armor grins at an intrepid Native andlowers his battle-axe. The Native rushes as theRabbit Warrior swings and SEPARATES the man from his legs.A NATIVE WOMAN lowers her head and charges her Dead Rabbit adversary,delivering a shattering BUTT to his stomach.A NATIVE BOY holds a rusty old pistol, which he uses at pointblank rangeagainst several Rabbits.A RABBIT WOMAN flies into a Native, using her IRON FINGER EXTENSIONS toGOUGE his face.The NATIVE with the deadly belt uses it to TEAR a piece out of a Rabbit'sface.Amsterdam, beginning now to be overwhelmed by the hellish fight, looksaround in growing PANIC for his father.SHANG uses his lead-rat blackjack to clear an escape back toward theBrewery. The Street Kids can tell he's trying to escape, and start BOOINGhim...... as Shang's GRABBED from behind and pulled off his feet by a PEG-LEGGEDNATIVE. He THROWS the boy to the ground and pins him by holding thesword-sharp point of his wooden leg against Shang's throat.SHANG(desperate)I run with you! I'm one of you! Born a Native American from the blood offive generations!PEG-LEGYeah? Then you oughta be a red Indian.He pushes down. Shang starts to bleed. But now PEG LEG is distracted bythe sudden SOUND of bells and whistles. He watches the BOY trembling onthe ground, then moves off him, making for the sound of the bell, leavingthe BOY quaking.The SOUND grows louder as TWO HORSE-DRAWN CARTS full of battle readyPOLICE tear around the curve of a narrow thoroughfare and stop in ParadiseSquare.The BELLS on the carts toll loudly and work magic. The fighting stops.The POLICE, all carrying clubs and wearing leather helmets, LEAP OFF thewagons.There are several moments of ABSOLUTE SILENCE, broken only by the SOUND ofthe wind and the GROANS of the wounded.Then, as one, the Dead Rabbits and the Native Americans RUSH the policetogether, hurtling stones and brandishing weapons. Even the Street Kidsget into the act, kicking and biting and generally having a fine time.The gangs SWARM all over the police, driving them back. Some lucky copsclimb back on the wagons and try to get away. The unlucky police remainbehind, dead on the ground.The GANGS cheer, jeer and continue to throw things at the retreatingPOLICE. When the second wagon disappears from view, the GANGS confronteach other once again.Another brief moment of QUIET. The Street Kids settle back into theirspectator role. Then the GANGS go at each other with fresh intensity.Amsterdam finally SEES his father and starts to PUSH his way toward him.VALLON and BILL THE BUTCHER stand facing each other in the midst of battlelike two titans: then they rush at each other, joining with a terriblefury.Shang, still blindly SWINGING his blackjack, makes his way closer to therelative safety of the Brewery, his face stained with tears of fear. Hehits someone. The MAN turns, swats him down. Shang sprawls on the street,which is a SWAMP of mud and blood and dirty snow, and finds himself faceto face with a departed PEG LEG. Someone has removed his artificial limband driven it through his heart.Across the square, Amsterdam has reached his father in time to see aNATIVE AMERICAN sneaking up behind him. Amsterdam grabs a long TRUNCHEONfrom a fallen warrior and uses it to hit the man a strong blow behind theknees.The MAN falls, howling. AMSTERDAM HITS him again. And again. He ishysterical.VALLON and BILL THE BUTCHER keep fighting. Amsterdam sees, with a singlelook, that his father is in the fight of his life. He looks for a weaponto help...... sees a HATCHET lying by the body of the Rabbit he has just beatensenseless. He grabs it and runs forward, looking for an opening betweenthe Butcher and his father...As the two combatants move, Amsterdam MOVES. Bobbing, weaving, feinting,falling back... looking for his chance...... as Bill deals VALLON a blow that ROCKS him back and throws him offbalance......just as Amsterdam has made his move. He RUSHES forward, sees his fatherFALLING, tries to turn but...... too late. The boy's hatchet SLASHES his father in the leg. VALLONfalls to one knee, gestures frantically to the stunned Amsterdam to getaway...... and Bill is upon VALLON, SINKING his knife into his chest. VALLONscreams and falls on his back, Bill kneeling over him. He looks into hisenemy's eyes ... and VALLON's EYES LOCK ON HIS. For all his suffering,VALLON's eyes HOLD Bill ... he forces himself to look at Bill...it's aterrible struggle... but VALLON will not look away.Amsterdam, hysterical, RUSHES at the Butcher. The Butcher grabs Amsterdamby the arm, making him drop his hatchet.BILL THE BUTCHERYou need a weapon? Use a knife.He puts the struggling boy's hand on the hilt of the knife that theButcher sunk into his father's chest.BILL THE BUTCHERIt makes a deeper cut.And, HIS HAND GUIDING THE BOY'S, he RAMS his knife deep into VALLON'sheart.BILL THE BUTCHERSay a benediction, Priest.VALLON bellows in agony. Amsterdam screams at the very same moment, hiscry mingling with his fatherls tearing through the air.BILL THE BUTCHER(to Amsterdam)Hold this close to mind, boy, should you ever think of going up againstthe Native Americans.Bill the Butcher rises and all around him, as if on some mysterioussignal, the fighting subsides. A DEAD RABBIT sees the fallen Vallon, takesa battered brass HORN from his belt and sounds THREE NOTES, quick andsharp. As the notes fade away, the fighting stops completely.BILL THE BUTCHER(announcing)Ears and noses will be trophies of the day.The Rabbits SCAMPER to collect their dead and wounded before the Nativescan get to them to slice off the battle souvenirs. But there are manycorpses maimed. The Street Kids DISPERSE. The main battle is over, and theNatives have clearly carried the day.The Rabbits file past Vallon, rorming a protective CIRCLE around him.Amsterdam kneels at his side. Vallon tries to speak. Blood bubbles in histhroat.VALLONCan't..can't cross the river... with steel through my heart.Amsterdam looks around. None of the Rabbits makes a move. This is clearlysomething he is meant to do himself.Amsterdam grabs the tortoise handle of the knife, PULLS on it. Vallontries not to cry out. The knife does not move.Amsterdam tries again. He can't budge the knife. Vallon MOANS. Nearlywild, Amsterdam PULLS with all his strength. Vallon SCREAMS in agony.Amsterdam is pulling so hard he raises his father's back four inches offthe ground. Still the knife will not move. Vallon passes out from the pain.Now, finally, someone steps forward: Monk Eastman. He leans over butAmsterdam, berserk with grief, pushes him away, turns back to his father,and, with a last desperate pull, DRAWS the knife from his father's heart.He throws it on the ground. Monk picks it up, wipes the blade on his arm,closes the knife and hands it to Amsterdam.MONKThat's yours, rightfully.Now Monk leans over the lifeless body and reaches inside Vallon's coat,REMOVING some money.MONKAnd this is mine. Only what's owed. Use the rest for funeral.AMSTERDAMNo!He tries to shove Monk away from his father, when the Native Warriorintervenes.HAPPY JACKIt's fair.Amsterdam, wild with shock and grief, turns back to his father as Monktakes what's owed him. Amsterdam bends over to KISS Vallon on both cheeks,then on his left eye.The boy is just about to kiss his fatheros closed right eye when the lidsprings OPEN - Amsterdam jumps back despite himself. Vallon stares at him:a last moment of recognition.VALLONHon ...AMSTERDAMNo, Pa!VALLON... honor me... think of me ... don't never look away.Vallon convulses and DIES. Amsterdam shakes him to revive him.RABBIT WOMANTake the body. Bring the boy.Several RABBITS take a step or two forward, but Amsterdam springs up atthem, like an animal.RABBIT WARRIORCome an, lad. Therels nothing to be done now.AMSTERDAMGet away! Get away!HAPPY JACKLeave him be. He's his to mourn.And the RABBITS turn away, going back to the Old Brewery or vanishing downthe narrow streets.Now a few CITIZENS venture out into Paradise square. A couple ofSCAVENGERS scoot about, looting bodies.Amsterdam stays in the center of the square unmoving, undisturbed, keepingsolitary vigil over his father.A TITLE is superimposed across this scene:NEW YORK CITY 18448 EXT. HARBOR DAY WINTER (MATTE)The same afternoon. As the sun goes down, we have our first full look(MATTE) at the low pale outlines of the city.The harbor is crowded with the high masts of sailing ships. Just north ofthe island tip is the steeple of the city's tallest structure, TrinityChurch. The buildings of Wall Street are masses of concrete and wood, thestreets surrounding them paved with cobblestones. Just above the financialdistrict are the sloping buildings and rutted avenue of the Five Points .The Old Brewery stands tall and forbidding over Paradise Square.Above the Five Points, in the distance, we can glimpse some finer, newerbuildings. One wide street--Broadway--seems to run from the very tip ofthe island clear up into the woods just a few miles north of the harbor.The only SOUNDS are the lapping of the harbor water against the boats, thecreaking of masts in the winter WIND.CUT TO9 EXT. HARBOR DAYA closer view - The TITLE fades off. We see an imposing edifice on theedge of the harbor with a wooden sign identifying: "IMMIGRATIONDEPARTMENT, UNITED STATES OF AMERICA."The sun has nearly set. A boy--about 10 years old--sits on the edge of theCastle Garden dock, gazing down at the frozen Hudson. He can just aboutmake out his reflection in the dull sheen of the ice. His name is JOHNNYSIROCCO, and he watches himself with bewildered seriousness.Abruptly, he reaches down and SMASHES through the ice with his fist. InSLOW MOTION, we watch the ice fragments drift apart in the river current,each bearing away a REFLECTION of Johnnyls face, like pieces of a puzzle.POLICEMANWhere's your family, sonny?Johnny sees a POLICEMAN scrutinizing him.JOHNNY(lilting brogue)My mother's just there.He gestures toward a ship, where MEN are unloading cargo. In a hoist, theyare lowering a thin pine COFFIN to dockside.JOHNNYOn the trip, her insides all broke up. She wasn't dead and there was threeothers fighting for her bed.POLICEMANAnd your father? Where's he, then?JOHNNYI never knew him.POLICEMAN(taking Johnny's hand)We better see to you, then.CUT TO10 EXT. STREET NIGHTThe Policeman leads an awed Johnny through the TEEMING streets of the FivePoints.POLICEMANWhere all those streets come together right ahead is the true Five Points.But most speak of the Five Points and mean anywhere between the Batteryand the Bowery.Although the night's cold, the streets are jammed. WHORES painted likecarnival Gypsies sell themselves to any man sober enough to stand up.SOUNDS of laughter and combat filter out from garish SALOONS like theLittle Naples, the Hell Hole, the Egyptian Hall.In the midst of all this highlife are BEGGARS and the SICKLY, looking forcharity, scrounging garbage in the street. An INDIGENT battles a CRIPPLEfor a meager scrap of faod. A richly dressed WOMAN, riding by in acarriage, hides her eyes by raising a HUGE BOUQUET OF FLOWERS in front ofher face.POLICEMANStreets hereabouts are lively of an evening. The city comes here to sport.But there's places to put up a boy on his own.Three WOMEN, exquisitely costed, burst from the door of the Egyptian Hall.Under the harsh glare of a nearby gas lamp, their faces are no longerstriking. Johnny STARES; there is something not right about these faces.JOHNNYAnd those? What are those?POLICEMANWell, those. Those are, as you might say, a sort of...We SEE one of the women's faces, suddenly harsh under gaslight: underthickly caked make-up is a smiling TRANSVESTITE.POLICEMAN... sort of whatnot.TRANSVESTITESay, policeman. I'll buy your bonny friend.The Policeman fetches the Transvestite a strong WHACK with his nightstick.The Transvestite screams and falls ... and Johnny RUNS.POLICEMANHey!But Johnny's off, already lost in the mad street life.CUT TOINT. MORTUARY NIGHTA funeral chapel.Vallan's body lies in state. He is wearing his gang regalia, and all theDead Rabbits FILE PAST his coffin in solemn tribute. A WOMAN bends downand kisses the body. Happy Jack Mulraney holds Vallon's crucifix, which hehas obviously inherited. As a disreputable looking Minister muttersPRAYERS, Happy Jack whispers to a silent Amsterdam.HAPPY JACKWe passed the plate amongst ourselves. Come up with enough ned to carryall this, and carry you a while, too.He stuffs some money in Amsterdam's pocket.AMSTERDAMWhere will my father rest?HAPPY JACKPotters Field, with everyone else.AMSTERDAMMy father won't be buried with everyone else. He'll lie separate in freshground, facing east.HAPPY JACKWhat difference where he faces?AMSTERDAMHe'll face east for the second coming of Christ.HAPPY JACKFine, son. When Jesus gets to the Battery you show Him the way from there.The Minister finishes the service. MR. CORNELIUS, a funeral director whoresembles one of his own customers, ushers in a WOMAN (MAGGIE) pulling alovely 10 year old GIRL (JENNY EVERDEKNE) by the hand.

The song she SINGS, however, is abawdy saloon song. Maggie cuts her off fast.MAGGIENo, Jen, the other.Jenny starts to sing a HYMN. To avoid looking at the corpse, she lets hereyes rove all around the chapel until she SEES Amsterdam. She locksstraight at him until the hymn is over. And he does not take his eyes offher.CUT TO12 INT. MORTUARY HALLWAY NIGHTMr. Cornelius is about to escort Maggie and Jenny into another roomcrowded with mourners when a smartly-dressed man (DANIEL KILLORAN)gestures to him from the shadows.KILLORANMr. Tweed would like a word, Mr. Cornelius.(Cornelius hesitates)Tweed of Tammany.At the mention of the name, Cornelius shoos Maggie and Jenny into themourning room and shuts the door behind them. Then he gives Killoran hisfull attention.KILLORANIn your office. At your pleasure, of course.CUT TO13 INT. MORTUARY OFFICEAs the door opens, we see a man gazing out the narrow window onto thespectacle in the next building. He is in his late 20s, already a littlefleshy but dressed with dash: WILLIAM TWEED... "BOSS" TWEED. He shows abemused, almost schalarly interest in the goings-on next door.This mortuary is located next to a bordello, where the windows areuncurtained and the energy and variety of theactivities inside is astounding.Tweed finally TURNS as Killoran opens the door.TWEEDMr. Cornelius. With a view like this I'm surprised the dead can rest inpeace.CORNELIUSIs there anything I can...TWEED(interrupting)Yes. A favor.CORNELIUSHappy to serve, Mr. Tweed.TWEEDExcellent. Lend me something.CORNELIUS(puzzled)Oh, I don't know what I could ...TWEEDI believe in form and appearance, you see. Just like yourself, sir. And Ibelieve in law, and the power of example.

I want you to help me set an example.(smiles)I only need to borrow one of your clients.CUT TO14 INT. MORTUARY NIGHTTwo native Americans open the door where Vallon is laid out and Bill theButcher STRIDES into the room.There is immediate TENSION, like an electric charge, as other Nativesstand in the doorway and crowd the hall stand while Bill walks over to thecoffin. He places a BLACK ROSE in Vallon's folded hands.BILL THE BUTCHERTomorrow your cortege will cross Paradise Square, into territory protectedby the Native Americans. You will be permitted undisputed passage bothways. That is our tribute. After that, any Rabbits wishing to join theNative Americans and willing to swear blood loyalty will be welcomed. Allothers will be dispatched.He starts out of the silent room, but STOPS when he sees Mank Eastmanlooking at him with easy interest. Bill the ButcherSTARES him down, but Monk's gaze never wavers.BILL THE BUTCHERI'll expect you first.MONKMe? Oh, I don't know. All that talk of blood loyalty makes me quake. I'llspill blood when the price is right. But blood for ceremony? I prefer holycommunion.BILL THE BUTCHERYou saw us fight today. You know we can pay any price.MONKNot mine. Not now, and not any time after.BILL THE BUTCHERWe'll see. Independence is a slippery thing. But being a rival ... well,that's dead dangerous.Bill brushes past Monk and leaves, followed by the NATIVES.Now the RABBITS file out, with Monk among them.HAPPY JACKCome on, boyo. I'll put you up tonight.AMSTERDAMI'll do for myself, Jack.HAPPY JACKYou can't.(Amsterdam stares at him)There's no mistaking you're his son.Happy Jack leaves Amsterdam alone in the room.Now, by himself, sure of no one seeing, Amsterdam CRIES.CUT TO15 INT.

There is alarge sign beside the body: "The Dead End of Lawlessness. Tammany AbhorsCrime. Tammany Means Justice."A sizeable CROWD is goggling at the body.

As the Crowd CHEERS,Tweed takes the bucket off the fire plug.TWEEDAlright, boys! To work!The MEN of the Americus Co. give a great SHOUT and start firefighting: ahose is hitched up to the plug, buckets are filled, a primitive pump sendswater spluttering everywhere.But there is not much blaze left to combat and the Men quickly growfrustrated.

Any number at all, come on.Several of the gang make a move toward Jack, but Shang WAVES them back.Jack departs UNHARMED, to general disgust. Jenny walks back across theroom to help the Brash Boy.

Amsterdam waits, WATCHES.Shang takes the RED SILK SCARF he got from Jenny's swag and hands it tothe Second Man. He and Shang SHAKE HANDS, as if they have concluded abusiness deal, and the Second Man walks away.Amsterdam PRESSES himself close to the door as Shang LOOKS AROUND...doesn't see Amsterdam... and walks off in the opposite direction, acrossParadise Square.CUT TO43 INT- RECEPTION ROOM AND TWEED'S OFFICE DAYThe main room is as loud and as prosperous as the stock exchange. Bill theButcher makes his way past Small GROUPS of men engaged in heated politicaldealings of dubious virtue.Bill knocks on the door to Tweed's private office while he's opening it.Inside is Boss Tweed, seated in a large WOODEN BOX like a primitive sauna.Around him are various PETITIONERS, and his assistant Daniel Killoran.TWEEDI dread city stimmers. They bring illness and beget vermin.PETITIONER #l (GLEASON)My plague box fends off all pestilence. Its elixir combats ill humors...KILLORANWe can't have every citizen of the Five Points boxed up like cargo.TWEEDBut the season is vicious, and I must take thought of our constituents.Mr. Gleason, I'd like you to shake hands with Mr. Barnett Baff...Gleason, dubious, shakes hands with PETITIONER #2 as Bill the Butcherlooks on with amusement.TWEEDA friend and owner of an estimable carting service. Work out anarrangement whereby the citizenry can receive the benefit of Mr. Gleason'swondrous elixir outside this excellent box. At a cost, Mr. Gleason, of howmuch the barrel ...GLEASON(figuring rapidly)Oh, perhaps twenty-five dollars.TWEED...and how much, Mr. Baff, for haulage and distribution...BAFFThe same again. At least.TWEEDAt least. That's a price of fifty dollars. And greedy, low piracy at that(Gleason and Baff splutter)But a price that Tammany, in its generosity, will meet. Merely submit abill for a hundred. We'll each have half. And I'll retain this box forfurther experiment. Hello, Bill.Killoran LEADS the astonished Gleason and Baff away as Bill APPROACHES.TWEEDBolt the door.Bill complies. As Tweed speaks and the anti-plague VAPORS SWIRL around hishead, he keeps his eyes closed.TWEEDScotchy Lavelle's gone wrong in his accounts.BILL THE BUTCHERI know. Scotchy's a good man.TWEEDNot good enough to rake thirty percent of our share from Sparrow's and useit for his own.(opens his eyes)You got to give him over, Bill.BILL THE BUTCHERI can't do that. No matter what he steals, I still get more from him thanany two others. As do you.TWEEDAlright then. What about Charles McGloin? He's running a panel game off toone side. Did you know that?(Bill shrugs)I can't get a day's work done for all the good citizens pouring in herecomplaining about crime and corruption all over the Points. They accuseTammany of carelesoness. Some even suspect ... a few practically suggest.(eying Bill significantly) ... our complicity with this rampant criminality. We must show themTammany stands behind the letter of the law. We need to set an example. BILL THE BUTCHER(beat)Charles McGloin will do.TWEEDI'll set the trial for Friday.CUT TO44 EXT- TOMBS DAYCAMERA moves high along the outside wall, past small rectangular slitsthat pass for jail windows. EYES peer out, as if a peep show is underwaydirectly below in the Tombs courtyard. A PRISONER is being readied for thegallows by having a hood tied to his head.The CROWD is in a carnival mood; HOT CORN GIRLS, STREET VENDORS,"HOKEY-POKEY" (i.e., ice cream) MERCHANTS, even BUSKERS, all add to theholiday spirit.Jenny works through the crowd, pushing and smiling her way past groups ofraucous merrymakers. She stops once or twice to have a word with aGENTLEMAN, flirts for a moment, then moves on.Further back in the crowd, Amsterdam NOTICES her. He watches her gothrough the crowd with an admiration that quickly turns to FASCINATION ashe realizes what she's doing: picking pockets. The best bludget in theFive Points. He starts to FOLLOW her.Jenny has worked her way close to the hanging platform, but she's sointent on her job she has not noticed Amsterdam. The closer the platform,the closer the spectacle and richer the pickings: Jenny's concentration isabsolute. On the platform, an ASSISTANT HANGMAN addresses the Crowd.ASSISTANT HANGMANThose interested in the effects of the condemned please come forward.44 CONTINUED:Part of the Crowd PRESSES in toward the platform, temporarily blockingAmsterdam's view of Jenny. He is right against the platform.ASSISTANT HANGMANWhat am I bid for this coat? A coat of some wear but excellent cut...containing a rather remarkable pocket silk...MAN IN CROWDBid a quarter!HANGMANA quarter, thank you. Do I hear fifty cents? Fifty cents?The Hangman is holding up the condemned man's coat which contains the REDSILK SCARF Amsterdam saw Shang give away. Amsterdam flips the HANGMAN aquarter, reaches out and GRABS the handkerchief.AMSTERDAMHere. Just for the silk.He stuffs it into his pocket and starts to PUSH his way through the crowd.On the platform, the WARDEN steps forward holding a primitive megaphone.WARDENDo you have any last remarks, Charles McGloin?McGloin grunts from underneath the hood.MCGLOINNot from under this hood I don't.Crowd near the platform begins to CHANT "No hood, no hood, no hood!" TheWarden puts his hand on the hood, starts to remove it...... and the Crowd CHEERS. Amsterdam turns, SEES: Charles McGloin. Bald,with a deep scar running front to back on his head. The very SAME MAN hesaw in the alley with Shang.McGloin acknowledges the cheers of the crowd. The Warden holds tomegaphone close and McGloin bellows...MCGLOINI never struck a foul blow or turned a card and may God greet me as afriend!The Crowd ROAR approval at these words. Amsterdam PUSHES through thecrowd, looking for Jenny ... SPOTTING her finally...... while up on the platform, the NOOSE is placed around McGLOIN's neck,and he is HOISTED UP in no time. We hear his neck SNAP. His feet kickafter death. The Crowd raises a zighty cheer.CUT TO45 EXT./INT. BROADWAY AND BROADWAY STAGE DAYAmsterdam walks with a crowd toward a waiting Broadway stage, a vehiclethat looks like a horsedrawn train car. The stage will take spectatorsback uptown from the hanging.He is working his way toward Jenny, who is now BOARDING the stage.Amsterdam DASHES through the crowd and SQUEEZES onto the stage, whichmoves forward with a JOLT.Once on board, Amsterdam looks through the jammed car, SEES: Jenny, aboutto sit down - A MAN has offered her his seat. She smiles dazzlingly as shesits...... and arranges her hands genteelly on her lap. The Man looks down on herand she smiles up at him again. He is bequiled.Amsterdam manages to get a little closer.MANI hope you won't think me rude if I speak.JENNYNo, sir. You look a proper Gentleman down to the ground.As this conversation continues, we watch-not only Jenny and The Man inconversation, and Amsterdam watching them; but we begin to notice whatAmsterdam SEES. Although Jenny's hands apparently remain folded on herlap, her RIGHT HAND moves SLOWLY out from her wrap... toward The Man...MANWell, I wouldn't want you to think me forward, you see.... and BRUSHES past his jacket. He does not notice or feel a thing.Jenny's hand GLIDES past his THIGH ... nearly brushing it ... moving upacross his pelvis and around his buttocks...JENNYDoes it matter to you what I think?MANWell, I might like it to.JENNYOh....toward his pocket. The Man is in Jenny's thrall. He feels nothing andcontinues to have no idea what is going on. But Amsterdam KNOWS. Everysilken, surreptitious move of her HAND across The Man's body is like aCARESS that Amsterdam can feel. Jenny's grace is balletic and EROTIC. Asshe picks The Man's pocket, she is, without knowing it, also seducingAmsterdamMANI mean, if you would like.JENNYI might like, sir. But I can't say now.Her hand HOVERS above his pocket, waiting for the SWAY of the stage tomatch and mask her movement....MANWhy?... and she starts to get up as soon as the stage JOSTLES. The entire carfull of passengers LEANS into one another...... and Jenny's hand SLIDES the Man's WALLET from his trousers ashe recovers his balance. Amsterdam watches her withdraw her HAND in aflash and hide it beneath her wrap.JENNYBecause this is my stop.MAN May I walk with you a little, then? JENNY(firmly)That would be too bold.MANBut I'll never see you again.JENNYI come every Thursday to the Tombs to see my father.MANI'll look for you.Jenny fetches him another fine SMILE--it's almost demure--and takes herway off the rear entrance of the stage.lt PULLS AWAY up Broadway and Jenny walks briskly toward an alley.CUT TO46 EXT. ALLEY/BROADWAY DAYJenny looks to make sure she has the alley to herself, then moves her bodya little...... and her arms seem to come off. She has been wearing a set ofARTIFICIAL ARMS, hollow inside, which she can leave folded on her lapmisleadingly while she goes about her pickpocketing.She's folding up the appliance--cotton sewn over a soft form-when a VOICEbehind her makes her turn.AMSTERDAMMay I walk with you a little, then?CUT TO47 EXT. BROADWAY DAYAs Jenny and Amsterdam walk through the noisy bustle of the city's mainthoroughfare.JENNYAre you a spy, then?AMSTERDAMGot no one to spy for.

If you want me, we come to a businessarrangement. lf the terms is right, then I decide how you suit me. Then Ido it or not.AMSTERDAMJust take a minute, I was Just...JENNY I know what you was just. I had years already of what you was just. Youknow how I got so good at thieving? So's I wouldn't have to lay down foreveryone who had the ned. Now I do it when I want to for how much I wantto. Otherwise I don't do it, and don't have to do it, and to hell withanyone's rules but my own. AMSTERDAMWhat about Shang's rules? You pay a lot over to him. The better your day,the better his. It don't seem gute right.JENNY(a little curious now)What's it to you?AMSTERDAMGive him this.He hands her the RED SILK SCARF. She recognizes it instantly as the sameone she gave Shang.AMSTERDAMAnd you can keep a little more of what you earned.JENNYHow'd you come by this?AMSTERDAMI got my own touch.JENNYAre you making me a present, or making an Arrangement?AMSTERDAMIt's your rules, right?

SPAPROW'S CHINESE PAGODA NIGHTA low and lunatic place: a combination of an opium dream out of theArabian Nights and a panel from a Bosch triptych. FAN-TAN games played byOrientals; WOMEN and CHILDREN of various colors suspended in cages fromthe ceiling as MEN and WOMEN in a secondfloor GALLERY point at them andJOKE. On the main floor, a long line waits for a shot at the barrel ofAll-Sorts. Jack charges in the front door, looks around.JACKAll right, step out, you yellow...All the NOISE subsides. Only the Fan-Tan game continues;nothing is so interesting that these Orientals will stop gambling.Now Amsterdam STEPS right in front of him. It's a grandstand play.AMSTERDAMHello, Happy Jack. I'm the one you're looking for.JACKThen you're marked for dead.Jack lunges ahead, swinging his NIGHT STICK. Amsterdam throws a chairacross his path.

SPARROW'S CHINESE PAGODAA Tammany victory celebration. When we last saw this place--as Amsterdamconfronted Happy Jack--the place was busy, alive. It's RIOTOUS now, jammedto bursting with POLITICIANS, CRIMINALS, GANG MEMBERS, MORTS, WHORES,HANGERS-ON, UPTOWN THRILL-SEEKERS, JOURNALISTS and COPS, not all of themoff duty. The SOUND of the place is a cacophony of SHOUTING, SINGING,GAMBLING and STRANGE MUSIC--which we can't identify at first. We STARTCLOSE on a huge ruby ring and we HEAR...BOSS TWEED(V.O.)Read what it says there, alongside the ruby...read it out ...... and WE MOVE OUT as a WELL-WISHER reads the Latin inscription.64 CONTINUED:WELL-WISHER"Fortuna Juvat Ordentes."TWEEDA grand victory gift from the men of Tammany.

We're going to build a new Cityhall, we better have something to put over the front door. And Mayor,you'll make sure the Latin's right?As Wood nods his assent, CAMERA MOVES across room...... past the gilded CAGES suspended ten feet over the floor, where thewomen and children look down at the action just below them with a mixtureof trepidation and resignation. Occasionally a REVELER will jump up to tryand GRAB one of the caged inhabitants. Still MOVING, CAMERA...... passes a stage, where we finally SEE the source of all the strangeMUSIC we've been hearing: the music is provided byCHINESE MUSICIANS, a woman SINGER, a DANCER and some ACROBATS. Theyperform some weird, mangled Five Points version of Chinese opera. Themusic and performance continues as we MOVE PAST...... across a PEWTER FAN-TAN TABLE, where CHINESE GAMBLERS play with fierceanimation and concentration. By comparison, the Occidental types playingbeside them seem like tourists.Everyone SHOUTS and SCRAMBLES to place bets with the FAN-TAN DEALER.Above the Dealer is an oval opening in the ceiling, through which OTHERPLAYERS may watch the action below. These FAN-TAN PLAYERS lean over anelegantly carved rail, peering at the action on the table below, placingtheir bets and collecting their winnings by means of a BASKET attached toWIRES that whirrs constantly overhead. We continue to MOVE PAST...... until we are at the door of the place, where Amsterdam, Johnny and theRabbits are having words with a BOUNCER.BOUNCERI don't know you, you don't enter.AMSTERDAM(enjoying himself)Come on, what are you saying? If you don't know us now, you'll know ustomorrow and you'll be working for us next week.JOHNNY(more temperate)Daniel Killoran knows us.BOUNCEROh he does?JOHNNYWe work for him.AMSTERDAMThe hell we do.JOHNNY(to Amsterdam)Tampen down, will you?BOUNCERWhy don't you all get the hell out of here and go fix on a story? Go on!He SHOVES Johnny, who STUMBLES back into Amsterdam. They're both mad now,and they step forward together toward the Bouncer...... until Killoran intervenes.KILLORAN(to Bouncer)It's all right, Nat. They're saying the truth. They gave a good day's workfor a good wage.Killoran HANDS OVER a paper-wrapped parcel of money, which Amsterdam takesfirmly.KILLORANA fine first showing. But second best.AMSTERDAMSecond, eh? You don't say so.KILLORANIt's no shame to be bested by veterans. The Native Americans always sweepthe field.AMSTERDAMWhat?KILLORANWe count on them sure as mass comes an Sunday.AMSTERDAM(to Johnny, glaring)Did you know this? Is this some scheme of yours?JOHNNYNo, I didn't have no idea ...AMSTERDAMI was working the same side as the Natives? The Natives?KILLORANThat's only right. Bill the Butcher's our ambassador throughout thePoints, as you might say. It's deemed an honor to work with him. Everyoneknows Bill Poole, everyone fears him, everyone ...AMSTERDAMI sure as hell don't fear him. And I sure as hell won't stand with him, orany who calls him one of theirs.KILLORANWell, if it's matter of personal honor, the money can only be a furtherinsult. I have no wish to rile you further, so if you'll allow me...He REACHES to take back the parcel of money, but Amsterdam BATS his handaway.AMSTERDAMWhere is he? Where's Bill the Butcher?KILLORANListen, buck. This is a Tammany night. If you and Bill Poole have mattersto settle, you can do it any other time, any other place, I don't give agood dancing goddamn. But you do it here tonight and all the Five Pointswill be down on you like the righteous wrath of heaven. or you could, asthe Book says, put away childish things. Join the celebration. Personally,I always find the least strenuous solution the most appealing. Don't you?Amsterdam stares at him as we...CUT TO65 INT. SPARROW'S CHINESE PAGODAAs a CHINESE ACROBAT TWIRLS in the air, off the stage, and lands in themiddle of the audience. The crowd is raucously appreciative as the Acrobatdoes GYMNASTIC MOVES among them...... past a table where the Dead Rabbits have settled. it is later in theevening, and everyone has been drinking.Amsterdam, sullen, intense, WATCHES .....Bill the Butcher, across the room. He is like a prince regent. Everyonepays him court, including several uniformed COPS, TAMMANY HANGERS-ON, andNEWSPAPERMEN. Bill receives the attention as his due....... while Amsterdam keeps watching, contempt and hatred gleaming in hiseye. He pays attention to none of the gang around, including Jenny. Johnnytakes advantage of the situation.JOHNNYI got experience. It's the education I lack.JENNYAnd you heard I was a good teacher?JOHNNYI don't listen to talk, I figure for myself. And I figured you'd be goodat everything you did.JENNYThat's right.JOHNNYAnd tonight I got the ned.JENNYAnd now what?JOHNNYNow I'm ready for you. Unless there's an arrangement between you andAmsterdam.JENNY(glancing over at Amsterdam)Not to my thinking.JOHNNY(needs to be sure)Amsterdam... listen up, Amsterdam...Amsterdam glances over at them.JENNY(to Johnny)You going with me or him? It's my thinking matters here. You don't have toask him nothing.AMSTERDAMWhat?JOHNNY(makes his decision)How's the evening passing?AMSTERDAMFine. Why?JOHNNY(puts his arm around Jenny)'Cause it's treating me fine too.She gets up and starts toward the stairs to the second floor, Johnnyfollowing her, holding her hand. As they pass Amsterdam he LEANS towardJenny.AMSTERDAMThis is no game, you and me. Don't go on like it's a game.JENNYI said already, it's not a game. It's business.Johnny pulls her away. As he watches her go through the crowd, Amsterdam'sgaze falls on Bill the Butcher again...... and for the first tine their EYES MEET. Bill's eyes rest on Amsterdam,take him all in... but DON'T REMEMBER him. He looks away as a TAMMANY HACKsteps up to pay court........ and a MASTER OF REVELS, center-floor, SHOUTS ...MASTER OF REVELSGentlemen and gentlewomen, if you please ... we will now... raise thecages and start the bidding!The Crowd CHEERS and KIDS PULL on a series of ropes and pulleys to RAISEthe CAGES further above the floor until they are parallel with thesecond-floor gallery of the Pagoda. WOMEN AND MEN call out BIDS even asthe cages rise through the air. Depending on their age, the Women andchildren inside the cages respond to the auction with grim resignation,trepidation or fear. A few, drugged or drunk on all-sorts, lie insensiblein their impossibly cramped space.Johnny and Jenny make their way along the second floor gallery until shespots a COUPLE LEAVING a room and walks inside. Johnny CLOSES the doorbehind them as a BURST of APPLAUSE...... rises from the main floor, where Bill the Butcher stands in the deadcenter of the room. He slowly removes his coat and hands it to a FLUNKY.He is wearing his battle vest underneath, and it is fully rigged with allhis butcher's implements.The place QUIETS. KIDS swarm silently, like busy ants, all over a hugewooden CHANDELIER, LIGHTING its HUNDREDS of CANDLES. Only the noise fromthe Chinese playing fan-tan in the far corner of the room can be heard now.The Kids finish lighting the candles and the chandelier is RAISED towardthe Pagoda ceiling, casting the whole place into a new riot of LIGHT andSHADOW as The Butcher prepares himself.Now the Chinese Opera DANCER steps forward and stands near Bill. He NODS.The unsprung MUSIC begins. The DANCER starts to move, sinuously......and Bill, with amazing skill, starts THROWING his KNIVES. The knifeMISSES the Dancer by a hairsbreadth, landing in the floor near her foot.She doesn't flinch. She keeps dancing. And Bill keeps THROWING...... the KNIVES, which follow the Dancer around the room in a careful,deadly choreography. They land just inches from where she has just been,or will be: in a wall; a pillar; the apron of the small stage; the bar;the barrel of all-sorts. After each knife LANDS, kids retrieve it. Whenone of the KNIFE KIDS pulls the blade from the all-sorts barrel, DRUNKSknock each other over to drink from the stream that flows from the hole.Native Americans, meanwhile, WORK THROUGH the awed, attentive Crowd. TheyAVOID Cops, Tammany Members and anyone who looks too prosperous or toosober. But when one of the Natives SPOTS a MARGINAL CITIZEN, they GRAB hishand and examine it as if they were telling fortunes.Center floor, Bill pulls TWO KNIVES out, BALANCES one in each hand ...... as a WHORE in the crowd pushes a guy who's groping her toward a coupleof Natives. Hels wearing a large RING. As soon as the Natives SEE the ringthey throw their arms around the GROPER like a long-lost pal and escorthim to Bill ...... who THROWS both knives rapidly at the Dancer. They land on the floor,inches from her dancing feet. She SPINS AWAY to great applause as theNatives bring the Groper to Bill.BILL THE BUTCHEREvening, sir. Are you prepared to be celebrated? Are you ready to befamous?GROPERHow much will it cost?BILL THE BUTCHERJust a moment of your time. My men will assist you.They do quite a bit more than that: they GRAB the Groper and KNOCK him tothe floor. In the crowd, one SPECTATOR turns to his companion.PAGODA SPECTATORWatch this careful. I've never seen the like, not even in Barnum's Museum.The Groper CRIES OUT as the Natives PIN HIM to the floor, SPREADEAGLED.Bill has one weapon left... in a special pocket, inside his vest. It's hisCLEAVER. He takes it out slowly, SAVORING the moment.The Pagoda goes QUIET. Only the gambling continues. The MUSIC dies. Theonly SOUND beside the noises of the Chinese at their fan-tan is theGroper, who HOLLERS for help as soon as he sees the cleaver.Bill HEFTS the cleaver in his hand, feels its weight, calculates timing,figures distance .... and starts THROWING it in the air...... CATCHING it by the handle ... then throwing it again... higher, FASTERand HARDER with every toss.BILL THE BUTCHER(in full control)What's it so quiet for? I don't need quiet.The Chinese opera MUSIC commences with a dissonant CRASH...... and Bill catches the cleaver again. But EVERY TIME he throws it andevery time he catches it by its handle ...... he also MOVES CLOSER to the terrified Groper. Now... standingvery close... he gives the cleaver a mighty toss ...... sending it SPINNING high in the air... up past the cages ... past thesecond-floor gallery, jammed with appreciative spectators ... until itSLOWS ... seems to HANG in the air... then starts its descent...... FALLING FASTER... towards Bill's waiting, STEADY HAND.The Groper SCREAMS in fear. Bill SMILES confidently, holding his hand outuntil ... just as smoothly, just as confidently...... he PULLS his hand AWAY and the cleaver FALLS with terrific impact onthe SPLAYED HAND of the Groper, cleanly SEVERING it at the wrist. TheGroper FAINTS dead away as a TREMENDOUS CHEER greets Bill's amazing feat.One of the Natives TOSSES Bill the severed hand.Bill SLIDES the ring off the finger and TOSSES it to the Chinese Dancer.BILL THE BUTCHERThere's for your beauty and your song.The Dancer puts the ring on her finger and DANCES OFF. Bill TOSSES thehand to the floor and walks back to his table. The Crowd PARTS, murmuringcompliments on his dexterity, and the Knife Kids reverently RETURN theButcher's implements.Now two DOGS from the rat pit in the back room RUN through the crowd andFIGHT FRENZIEDLY over possession of the bloody hand.The Crowd PASSES the Groper overhead and WE SEE from ABOVE: the Groper'sunconscicus BODY being passed from hand to hand. The Crowd looks like awave bearing the body toward the door. The Groper's stump BLEEDS on themas he passes overhead, sprinkling drops of blood and flesh like a moveablesacrament.Bill approaches his table, acknowledging the continuing adulation, and isabout to sit down when a VOICE rises above all others.AMSTERDAMMr. Poole!Bill turns, searching out the voice ...AMSTERDAMBill Poole!And SEES Amsterdam, standing at his own table. His attitude is calm,smiling, respectful. But his eyes are demonic.AMSTERDAMMy compliments on your exhibition, sir.BILL THE BUTCHERThank you, sir.AMSTERDAMIt was like watching a dance.(Bill nods his thanks)Some great grand goddamned dance. (Bill looks at him more closely)You know me, sir.BILL THE BUTCHERDo I? Are you missing a finger?Appreciative laughter from the crowd.AMSTERDAMNo. A father.The laughter turns a little uneasy. Bill the Butcher sizes up the youngerman.BILL THE BUTCHERDo you have a name?AMSTERDAMAmsterdam.BILL THE BUTCHERThat's a New York name.(suddenly smiles)shall we drink to it?AMSTERDAMIndeed.(they drink)And to my other name. Vallon. Will you drink to that?BILL THE BUTCHERPriest Vallon's son?(Amsterdam nods)Of course I'll drink to that. Your father was a worthy man.AMSTERDAMNot worthy of you. Those dogs ain't worthy of you. You ain't worth whatthey feed on, and what they shit's too good for you.DEAD QUIET. Absolute. Breathless. Only the Chinese Gamblers at theirfan-tan ignore this confrontation.BILL THE BUTCHERWhat do you want, boyo?AMSTERDAMI got to give you something, Butcher. Something from my father.Amsterdam PULLS OUT the piratels knife which Bill the Butcher used to killhis father almost 12 years before.BILL THE BUTCHERYou got the sand to draw a blade in front of me? You will make good sport.Come ahead and give it here, you son of a bitch. And Amsterdam THROWS the knife, the bright blade FLASHING OUT of his handlike lightning.And just as quickly the Buitcher PICKS UP his table, sending glassesflying and breaking, using it as a SHIELD...... and the knife THUMPS into it dead center. The Butcher HEAVES the tableat Amsterdam...sending PATRONS yelling and SCATTERING.Amsterdam LEAPS out of the way of the table, then RUNS AT Bill theButcher...... who's already coming for him. As they CLASH and GRAPPLE with eachother...... PATRONS all over the Pagoda crowd around for a good view of the actionand start to MAKE BETS on the outcome. The odds do not favor Amsterdam.And neither does the fight. Amsterdam fights with real blood lust, but hedoesn't have the Butcher's skill, or experience, or dispassion. He breaksthe Butcher's CLINCH... HITS him once in the face... then a second time... and then gets FLOORED by a well placed kick. The Crowd cheers.And, on the second floor, Jenny and Johnny come out of the room. Stillarranging her clothes, Jenny looks over the gallery rail onto the floorbelow, sees the fight... and starts to RUN down the stairs. Johnny WATCHESher go ... looks at the fight again, for a second... then follows Jenny tothe main floor.The Butcher is on top of Amsterdam now. He HITS him upside the head withthe wood and brass handle of his cleaver. Then hits him again. AND AGAIN.In the Crowd now, Jenny finds Sheeny Mike.JENNYThe Butcher'll kill him if we don't do something.SHEENY MIKEIt was Amsterdam's own doing. And it'll be our death too if we try to stopit.JOHNNY(finally catching up)That's the truth.JENNYThe truth is you don't give a damn about him.SHEENY MIKEYeah, well, if he gave a damn about us he wouldn't have called out theButcher in the first place.Jenny looks at him with contempt, then STARTS into the crowd. Johnny grabsher ARM but she pushes him off.On the floor, Bill uses the FLAT SIDE of the cleaver to SMACK the barelyconscious Amsterdam on one side of his face... then on the other...REPEATEDLY... until Amsterdam is barely sensible. Bill grabs him by thehair. Amsterdam's body is slack.BILL THE BUTCHERWhat do you say? Loin or shank? Rib or chop?The Crowd YELLS their choices. Jenny tries to PLUNGE through towardAmsterdam, but a HALF-DOZEN MORTS and WHORES put hands on her and HOLD herback.BILL THE BUTCHERCome on, let me hear you!(the Crowd yells louder)You're all talking at once, I can't hear you!(a near frenzy)I don't hear the choicest cut! The best, the vital!(they quiet a little to listen)The heart. I think I must have the heart!This is greeted with the biggest CHEER of the night. The newlyelectedMayor Wood seems to feel as if he should do something to stop theslaughter, but Boss Tweed calms him with a single dismissive GESTURE. Eventhe Boss himself is excited by the prospect of this ritual sacrifice.BILL THE BUTCHERCome on, look at it! You fancy yourself a gladiator, act a gladiator!(raises his cleaver)Watch the death blow when it comes to you. Go to hell with open eyes!Bill the Butcher readies himself to deliver the blow... and a HAND GRABShis wrist, STOPPING his arm.Who would dare do this to Bill the Butcher? Bill turns, incredulous, tolook into...... the untroubled face of Monk Eastman.MONK EASTMANIt's been a full evening's fun now, Butcher. It's enough.BILL THE BUTCHERYou got nothing to do with this, Monk.MONK EASTMKNWell I'm the game warden, you might say. I'm telling you this buck's tooyoung yet. Wait till he's aged for a proper kill.BILL THE BUTCHERThe hell.With his gigantic strength, Monk actually PULLS the Butcher off Amsterdamand onto his feet.MONK EASTMKNJust settle yourself Bill ...... and he part SHOVES, part THROWS Bill back a good twenty feet.MONK EASTMKN... and let the merrymaking continue.The Dead Rabbits have scampered forward, and they're picking Amsterdam upoff the floor. Monk looks at Jenny and Johnny, who each have Amsterdam byan arm.MONK EASTMANIt was his father took me in first, and it's thanks I'm returning now.BILL THE BUTCHEREastman!MONK EASTMAN(ignoring Bill)This squares any debt. Get him out of here.BILL THE BUTCHERMonk Eastman!As the Rabbits CARRY Amsterdam toward the door, Monk finally turns hisattention back to Bill.BILL THE BUTCHERI'll have you then!MONK EASTMANCome ahead, Bill. Unless you're wanting to shout me to death.And Bill comes forward, BRANDISHING his cleaver. Monk Eastman stands hisground, unmoving, untroubled. Everyone looks on in awe at this contest ...... except Boss Tweed.BOSS TWEED(to Killoran)If these two are going to combat, it aught to be a worthier occasion. Andmore rewarding for all.Tweed SIGNALS to Bill: STOP. The Butcher sees the signal but can't believeit. He SHAKES his head. His blood is up. He won't stop.Tweed SIGNALS AGAIN. Bill KEEPS COMING.Tweed signals Killoran, who STANDS himself. And, when he stands, every COPand TAMMANY LOYALIST in the place--a hundred of them anyway--STAND behindBoss Tweed.As Bill keeps coming, and Monk stands easy, waiting...... the Natives and their ALLIES now stand, facing the Tammany crew. TheTammany backers, dressed flush and fancy, face the scruffier, more savageFive Points bunch: the twin factions of the criminal underworld, sodifferent in style and so similar in purpose, SIZE EACH OTHER UP fromopposite sides of the room.Bill STOPS. The odds are shifting, the stakes are climbing. Even theChinese STOP GAMBLING. For the first time all evening the room isabsolutely STILL. Even the Dead Rabbits have turned, at the door, to seewhat will happen.Tweed and the Butcher LOCK EYES: neither blinks. Then after a moment ... avery long moment ... a calm, bemused Tweed RAISES his glass.BOSS TWEEDI only wanted to thank you, Bill, for the customary good job today... andan equally bright future for us both.Another pause. Bill does not look placated. The whole place seems ready toexplode...... until Boss Tweed RISES to his feet, and RAISES his glass higher.BOSS TWEEDWill you drink with me, Bill, as a friend? An honored friend.Bill weighs the proposition... then looks to his men, NODS his head tocall them off. He GRABS a glass off a table to join Tweed's toast.The MUSIC begins again. The gambling recommences. Patrons take theirseats. The Dead Rabbits help Amsterdam out the door.Monk Eastman sidles up to Bill the Butcher.MONK EASTMANIf there's one thing I can't abide, it's fighting for free.He takes the Butcher's glass from his hand, raises it in salute, DRINKSDEEP and hands it back to him.At the door of the Pagoda, a badly beaten Ansterdam starts FLAILING andfighting by brute instinct. He HITS Jenny, and she goes down. Johnnygrapples with him as Jenny PICKS HERSELF up and struggles to help SUBDUEAmsterdam.JENNYGo easy! Go easy. It's over.JOHNNYHe knew what he was doing, hitting you.JENNYLet's get him up.She grabs Amsterdam's arm and, with Johnny's help, tries to HOIST him backto his feet.JENNY(Looking at Amsterdam's bloody face)Therels too damn little of him left to know anything.They start across Paradise Square, holding him up...... as the rest of the Dead Rabbits join to help them... all growingsmaller in the distance against the primeval nighttime landscape of theFive Points...... and the Bouncer CLOSES the door.DISSOLVE TO66 INT. DON WHISKERANDOS BARBER SHOP DAYAnother DOOR OPENS, and Amsterdam stands on the threshold. A week or sohas passed since the big night at Sparrow's Pagoda, but Amsterdam's facestill shows the marks of Bill's beating.Don Whiskerandos is ministering to Monk Eastman with a straight razor,giving him a close and careful shave. Monk is thoroughly relaxed, doesn'teven glance over when the door opens, hardly reacts when Don Whiskerandossays ....DON WHISKERANDOSSomeone's here for you.MONK EASTMANThat so? What's he look like?DON WHISKERANDOSHe looks pretty damned sorry.MONK EASTMAN(looks at Amsterdam)Indeed.- Can I buy you a shave?AMSTERDAMNo thanks.MONK EASTMANFace is too sore, eh? I understand.AMSTERDAMNo. I'm beholden enough to you as it is. I don't like to be beholden.MONK EASTMANWe're all even, son. There's nothing more between us.AMSTERDAMI'd like it if there was.MONK EASTMANAre you proposing employment?AMSTERDAMA collaboration. The Dead Rabbits got to get strong before we make anothermove. I figure you're the one to make us strong. There's a lot we canlearn from you.MONK EASTMANBoyo, I'm a freebooter and a mercenary, not a teacher. I can't learnnothing from you and I can't earn nothing from you either.AMSTERDAMThe Dead Rabbits is going to be glorious again. We're going to reign overthe Points.MONK EASTMANAnd Bill Poole's Natives? What will they have to say?AMSTERDAMNothing. They won't have tongues left to speak.MONK EASTMANDon't worry about what theylll have in their mouths. You think about whatthey got in their hands.(beat)Listen, son... take a word from a man who was honored to fight beside yourfather. Temper yourself like a sword, and pay attention to balance. Angerspoils an edge.AMSTERDAMThen you say no?Monk SIGHS and points to a huge WAR CLUB which hangs in a place of honorabove the shop mirror. It has deep marks running along its front, likeNOTCHES-MONK EASTMANYou see my instrument there? First notch represents two dollars and fiftycents. That's how much I got for my first kill. There are forty-eight morenotches after it, and my fee has grown with each one. I can accommodateyou alright, but you got to afford me. So do business with me or do it onyour own.AMSTERDAMEverything I got is still to come. So I guess it's on my own, then.MONK EASTMANFair enough. You'll find independence a fine thing, a fierce thing.Although I do hold money preferable to all.(Amsterdam turns to leave)But I'm sure we'll have news of each other.AMSTERDAMBound to.As he shuts the door of the shop, Monk Eastman gestures to DonWhiskerandos for another hot towel.CUT TO67 EXT. STREETS OFF PARADISE SQUARE DAYA large wagon bearing a Tammany banner and carrying dozens of small sacksof coal moves slowly down the narrow street. Boss Tweed sits on the frontseat, next to the driver, as his minions HAND him coal sacks. Tweeddistributes them with a smile to the NEEDY who trot next to the wagon.BOSS TWEED(to the people as they grab the coal)Tammany's here to take the chill off the winter and the weight off yourheart. It's Tammany can make this city a fit place, with the help and voteof all you good people...As he continues, Bill the Butcher JUMPS onto the wagon and sits downbeside him. Boss Tweed hardly gives him a glance.BILL THE BUTCHERYou sent me word.BOSS TWEEDWe could use help here. Grab a sack.BILL THE BUTCHERI keep my hands clean.BOSS TWEED(now he looks at him)So I've observed.BILL THE BUTCHER(tense)Better be on your mark to talk like that to me. It was you stopped me atthe Pagoda. I would have cut Monk inside out.BOSS TWEEDWhat if you hadn't? Think of the embarrassment. And what if you had?Consider the waste. Next time you're in a dust-up like that, think aheadand make proper plans. It'd be a grand source of revenue, whoever prevails.BILL THE BUTCHERIt touches my heart how you always. have our best interests in mind.BOSS TWEEDOur mutual interests. That's why I want you to contact Monk Eastman.(Bill's incredulous)I want you to extend a proposition. I want him to join US.BILL THE BUTCHERWhat?BOSS TWEEDOh, not Tammany, of course not. We could no more have him there than you.But he should throw in with the Native Americans, become aware of ourArrangement and ... well, use his influence, shall we say, to enrich usall.BILL THE BUTCHERYou're saying I can't do everything you need? You don't think the Nativeshas been doing good and right? You think there's something more he can dothat I ...BOSS TWEED(interrupting)It's none of that, Bill. None of that. His independence is like a rebuketo Tammany. And an insult to you.BILL THE BUTCHERThen you should have let me have him at Sparrow's.BOSS TWEEDI should. If I'd been confident-absolutely certain--that you would haveprevailed. Monk is an unpredictable power, and a figure of size. He needsto be reckoned with.BILL THE BUTCHERHe needs to be killed.BOSS TWEEDNo. He's an elemental force. Them you don't destroy. But you can containthem and use them for the good they give off.He hands Bill a sack of coal.BOSS TWEEDCoal?Bill doesn't answer. He HOPS DOWN off the moving wagon, and the Needy giveway quickly before him, then regroup and SWARM after Tweed and his coal.The Boss continues with his Tammany spiel-enjoying all the attention--asthe Butcher watches, disdainful of Tweed but filled with angryfrustration. From his face we ...DISSOLVE TO68 INT. DON WHISKERA.NDOS BARBER SHOP DAY... the incredulous face of Monk Eastman, as he looks at Bill the Butcher.MONK EASTMANAnd this is your offer?BILL THE BUTCHERIt's Boss Tweedls offer.MONK EASTMANHow do you think we'd sit as allies, Bill?BILL THE BUTCHERThe only way we could tolerate being near each other would be stretchedout dead.MONK EASTMANMy thoughts exactly. Then why are you here? Because you were asked to be.You were ordered to be. And who would order me among the Natives? You? Andwould you follow my orders, even if they was being relayed from WilliamMarcy Tweed himself?He EASES himself out of the barber chair. The Butcher TENSES as Monk comestoward him.MONK EASTMANDubious and doubtful, my friend. But your offer--pardon, the offer youbring--is the most generous that's ever been extended. I favor the terms,if not the personalities. So let us decide the way any Native Americanwould appreciate. We'll do it the democratic way.He throws open the door of the barber shop and stands there, beside Billthe Butcher, his arm thrown carelessly around him. PASSERSBY stop inwonderment as Monk ADDRESSES them.MONK EASTMANCitizens of the Five Points! It seems the Native Americans have come totrouble. They have grown so weak that now they seek my help. They can payany wage I ask. But I ask you now. Even for money, should I carouse andconspire alongside a boyo like this with gristle on his knife and spittleon his chin every time his cock gets hard?Monk is beaming, the Butcher is appalled. His body tenses like a snakeready to spring. But the people in the street just STARE- They can'tbelieve what they've just heard.MONK EASTMAN(to Bill)There. You see. I'm afraid the people have spoken.BILL THE BUTCHERI'll see you again, you bog Irish bastard.MONK EASTMANWell, if it's a fight you want now, Bill, remember to come back with abankroll.Monk returns to the shop and the comfort of his chair. Bill GLARES at thepeople in the street. One lock from him starts them moving fast. But theydo not look away from him quite so fast, or at him, either, with quite thesame fear.CUT TO69 INT. MISSION (FORMERLY OLD BREWERY) NIGHTThe vast main room has been changed into a dance floor and decorated forthe evening. An altar has been hung with bunting; SHIP'S LANTERNS andCANDLES illuminate the place. The REVEREND SHADRACH RALEIGH GREETSeveryone. The room, already crowded with CELEBRANTS of all ages, growsquiet as the Dead Rabbits, done up in their party best, show up for therevelry.REVEREND RALEIGHAh, the Native Americans, is it now?AMSTERDAMAre they coming?JENNYWe don't want a ruckus, minister.REVEREND RALEIGHNor do I. I intended no disrespect. I'd heard the Native Americans werefigures of the greatest prominence here.AMSTERDAMIndeed they are, just for the moment. Let them come. Happy to have them.Everyone's welcome in a house of God, isn't that right, Reverend?REVEREND RALEIGHAs all are welcome in heaven.SHEENY MIKEIld like to go to heaven. Ild like to go to heaven and bite off Gabriellsear.REVEREND RALEIGHYou're still welcome, even with such peculiar appetites.AMSTERDAMBut if the Natives do come, Father...REVEREND RALEIGHI'm not a priest, son ...AMSTERDAM... there's no accounting for what may follow.REVEREND RALEIGHI'm sure God's hand will guide us in that. Just as He guided you here atthe right perfect time, with a right perfect regent. The young lady withthe sunset hair. Miss ...JENNYEverdeane. Jenny Everdeane.REVEREND RALEIGHMiss Everdeane. Step forward, please.Radiant and curious, Jenny joins the Reverend Raleigh in the center of theroom.REVEREND RALEIGHAnd the evening's regent chooses her evening's partner.There is much MUTTERING about this from everyone. Someone makes a wet,farting SOUND.REVERAND RALEIGH(unfazed)Here we make only joyful noises to the Lord.Under the instruction of the bustling Reverend and his HELPERS, the Womenskeptically stand away from the Men, who allow themselves to be arrangedinto a LINE. The Reverend Raleigh escorts the delighted Jenny to a chairthat has been placed, by itself, in the center of the room. Jenny sitsdown, facing away from the rest of the guests. She holds a MIRROR in herhand.REVEREND RALEIGHNow. The men, please. One by one.The first volunteer Reverend Raleigh brings forward is a reluctant SheenyMike. There are RUDE COMMENTS as he leads Mike slowly to the center of theroom, coming up behind Jenny until she can see Mikels face reflected inthe mirror. She SHAKES her head.REVEREND RALEIGHNext Gentleman, please.More laughing. The BOYS push out one CANDIDATE. Rejected.Now ANOTHER CANDIDATE comes forward. And STILL ANOTHER- Jenny rejects eachwith the composure of a princess.Now it is Johnny's turn. He WALKS slowly across the big room, and standsbehind Jenny, trying to look confident. The moment is long, the room'stense... until--just once but very decisively-Jenny SHAKES her head.Jenny watches Johnny's face in the mirror. She stays still. Finally, hewalks back to the GANG.Now Amsterdam starts toward the center of the room. He keeps his eyesfixed on Jenny.Jenny catches Amsterdam's reflection in the mirror. He STOPS. She NODS herhead. Yes. Him.A small BAND strikes up a barely recognizable version of "A MightyFortress Is Our God," arranged in waltz time. Jenny rises and holds outher arms to Amsterdam. They start to DANCE, a little clumsily, as otherCOUPLES join them.AMSTERDAMSo you accept?JENNYWhat?AMSTERDAMYou accept to be my mort and no one else's.JENNY(teasing)No, it's just that I didn't recognize you in the mirror. You still gotsome of the face the Butcher gave you.AMSTERDAM(going along with the joke)It's not the Butcher, it's the dancing. It shifts my face all around.JENNYMaybe you'll look better later.The Reverend Raleigh and his Helpers DASH among the dancers, distributingLIGHTED CANDLES, which the COUPLES take and hold as they move around thefloor.AMSTERDAMI will if we're together later.(she smiles)And what about after that? After tonight?JENNYI chose you just for tonight. If that's not good enough I'll go withsomeone else.She takes a candle from the Reverend and holds it so the light FLICKERS onAmsterdam's face.AMSTERDAMI'll have tonight. But after this don't come to me no more till you'reready. No more.His eyes, in the candlelight, show both his love and his Resolution. JennyNODS and they DANCE AWAY ...... losing themselves now among the dancers, all moving and holdingcandles. As they dance, their movement becomes SPLIT, SEQUENTIAL, a studyin motion like an old Gjon Mili photograph. Their bodies create a RUSH OFYELLOW LIGHT ACROSS the screen like the tail of a comet.CUT TO70 INT- DEAD RABBITS HOUSE NIGHTIn the hallway. JOHNNY stands pressed against a door.JOHNNY(whispering)Amsterdam.(louder; hissing)Amsterdam!AMSTERDAM (V.O.)Who is it?JOHNNYMe.AMSTERDAMCome on in.JOHNNYI don't want to come in! You come out.AMSTERDAMJust a damn minute.AMSTERDAM comes to the door, half-dressed and sleepy. We see Jenny asleepon the floor inside.AMSTERDAMWhat do you want?CUT TO71 EXT. PIER/DEAD RABBITS HOUSE NIGHTJust before dawn. The streets are empty, the river is quiet. AMSTERDAMfollows JOHNNY out of the house.JOHNNYI'm going to fight you.AMSTERDAMOh, Jesus, Johnny, I'm tired. How about sometime else?JOHNNYNow.AMSTERDAMYou want to tell me what this fight's over? Is it The Butcher? Jenny?(Johnny turns, determined)Alright, alright. Then tell me why like this?JOHNNYSo when I lose no one will see.And he SLUGS him. Hard. Harder even than he thought he could. AMSTERDAMstumbles, stunned, then pulls himself up. And CHARGES at Johnny, knockinghim down.The two friends PUNCH, WRESTLE, BITE and PUMMEL EACH OTHER with suchextravagant energy that they soon...... ROLL OFF the pier...CUT TO72 EXT. PIER DAWN... onto the muddy ground underneath the pier. They LAND with a shudderingSPLASH in the soggy earth, but they keep fighting ....... as a PACK OF ORPHANS, eyes glinting like night animals, scatter likewild beasts disturbed in their burrow.Amsterdam has the physical advantage, and more skill.

Seated along both sides of the table isan array of the city's POWER BROKERS, with whom Tweed and his TammanyMINIONS mix easily. Their attitude toward the Power Brokers is a mixtureof ribald fawning and fine condescension; the Power Brokers, in turn,enjoy the food, and the MUSIC from a small BAND, and the DANCING GIRLS whoflirt and entertain them, while exuding the unmistakable impression ofamateur anthropologists exploring a decaying civilization.Tweed is courting and joking with a bewhiskered HORACE GREELEY, editor ofthe influential Tribune.GREELEYI may enjoy the bounty of your table and the pleasures of your company,Mr. Tweed ...BOSS TWEEDAnd the pleasures of the company provided you, Mr. Greeley.GREELEY...without the Tribune endorsing your politics.BOSS TWEEDI suppose you can at that.

Come ahead.Now that I met your mother, you should come and meet my father.As Jenny starts to WALK towards the grave, we see for the first time ...... that we are in the country, a graveyard in an open field with anastonishing PANORAMA of New York and the East River. (MATTE) The cemeteryis atop a hill, and the East River, busy with ferries and vessels oftrade, glistens in the near distance. Just beyond it is Manhattan Island:low buildings, winding narrow streets, houses surrounded by open land. ABREEZE off the river rustles Jenny's dress and blows her hair as she stepsup to the grave site, looks at the headstone and sees ...... it is blank. No name, no date. Clean stane.JENNYYou should finish the stone.AMSTERDAMIt'll be finished when everything's finished. That's when helll rest. Thehand that killed him is the hand that will bury him in peace.He holds up his open hand, covered in dirt.JENNYIt was Bill killed him, not you.AMSTERDAMWith my hand on the knife.JENNYAnd his hand on yours!AMSTERDAMAnd me feeling the life go out of my father! He looked at me ... he lookedat me and he swore me with his eyes. I could feel his spirit... I say Icould feel it rising... flowing through the knife like blood into my ownheart.JENNYYou talk like he lives in you.AMSTERDAMI don't want him to live, I want him dead! I kill Bill and I'm free ofthem both!JENNYYou think you can be free that easy? You need your way so clear, andyou''' use anything to clear it. Anyone, too. Me, everybody, we're alljust a way for you to settle your damned ghosts.AMSTERDAMYou're part of me now, like the gang is part of me and my father both. IfI can bring us to glory, then my father... like The Book says...my fathercan enter his house justified.As Amsterdam continues to talk we ...DISSOLVE TO91 MONTAGEThe growth of the Dead Rabbits, as we continue to HEAR Amsterdam speakpassionately to Jenny. We first see the Rabbits surrounding andOVERTURNING a fire wagon; this starts as a live action scene but soonBLEEDS into SEPIA, then freezes like an old magazine illustration.AMSTERDAM (V.O.)All of us is set on the same road together. The gang can have everythingthey ever wanted and get me what I want while they're doing it. We're notinterfering with each other, we're helping each other. It's all the same,we're all one together.We CONTINUE with sepia illustrations: of Dead Rabbit morts picking pocketsand purses along a crowded Broadway; climbing onto a wagon distributingnewspapers and tossing off the occupants, taking over the routethemselves; swarming all over a merchant ship in the harbor as the captaindoles out protection money to have his cargo unloaded.AMSTERDAM (V.O.)We'll all have a share of the profit like we'll all have a portion of thefame. If we come to be notorious, that only means we're strong, and ifwe're strong that means we're ready.A sepia illustration of a fire wagon rounding a corner, refurbished andmanned by Rabbits, all wearing striking uniforms with short capes calledTAMLAS. (N.B.: they will be seen wearing the tanlas from these uniformsduring all gang activity throuqhout the rest of the film. Only Johnny,Amsterdam and Jenny do not wear them.)The sepia illustration turns to live action as the fire wagon TEARS aroundParadise Square, SCATTERING everyone in its path, the Dead Rabbitslaughing, their tamlas FLYING behind them.AMSTERDAM (V.O.)And I'll know that time, know it right off when it comes. Just like I knewyou.The live action DISSOLVES TO...... the last image in the montage: an ILLUSTRATION of Amsterdam, ahalf-decade older, turned out in fancy clothes, but with all hisfierceness intact. This is a magazine illustration, and there is a datedheadline over his picture: "Fresh Scourge of the Five Points."

Amsterdam, as he is in the picture, but in live action, SPRINGING tohis feet and YELLING at a couple of PRIZEFIGHTERS doing battle in a ring.AMSTERDAMNow! Finish him now!Far up the sparkling Hudson, a RAFT floats slowly upstream. It's a hugething (perhaps half a city block in size) crowded with SPORTSMEN. Theyform a LARGE RING around two mammoth PRIZEFIGHTERS who are brawling withbare knuckles. Amsterdam and Johnny are among the spectators.JOHNNYOur man will take him in another five. What puts you in such a hurry?FIGHTER 1 fetches FIGHTER 2 a powerful roundhouse punch that sends himCRASHING to the deck. As soon as he hits the floor, a CARD GIRL appearscarrying a sign announcing "Round 37.11 SECONDS drag the stupefied Fighter2 to his corner, while two BOYS minister to Fighter 1, SUCKING THE BLOODoff his knuckles.A GONG sounds to announce the appearance, in the center of the ring, ofthe fight promoter, a florid and fulsome P.T. Barnum .BARNUMI want to extend thanks and admiration not only to our two combatantstoday, but to their sponsors, the Dead Rabbits ...(indicates one side of the ring)... and the Native Americans.He FLINGS an expansive arm toward the opposite side of the ring, whereBill the Butcher sits with Daniel Killoran and a large group of Natives.Amsterdam and the Butcher eye each other with all the old animosity: it'salmost ceremonial now, part of the Tradition.BARNUMTheir generous support allows me to bring you this splendid exhibition.With their indulgence I'd like to remind you also of the further wondersthat await you at my new Museum, located on Broadway...There are BOOS from the crowd at such untoward commercialism.BARNUM... P.T Barnum's gallery of wonders from worlds natural and unnatural,from nature and from myth!(continued boos)And to encourage you also in the view that new Albany ordinancesforbidding sportive violence on land shouldn't dampen your enthusiasm forwagering. Bets down, entlegen, and you gents..(indicated fighters)... fists up!The Fighters come to center ring, circle each other, then start slugging.A flurry of punches, and Fighter 2 GOES DOWN again. As he hits the deck,the round automatically ends and the between-rounds ritual takes placeagain.JOHNNYDobbs will take him this round. That'll be something. The Natives hasnever lost before.AMSTERDAMBecause there's never been a Dead Rabbit fighting before.JOHNNYThat'll shame them thorough.AMSTERDAMThere'll be worse than shaming. We only got the Natives in range.It's time to squeeze the trigger, John.The next round begins and the Fighters set to, MAULING each otherfuriously.JOHNNYDon't push the Natives too far, Amsterdam. Otherwise it'll be Tammanypushing back.AMSTERDAMThat don't matter any more.JOHNNYIt does matter, and it's going to matter even more. Tammany's the heartand future of this city. If the Rabbits is going to keep growing, we'regoing to have to throw in with Tammany some way.The action in the ring is FURIOUS. The Crowd cheers. Fighter 1 seems aboutto go down, but recovers and starts returning punishment to Fighter 2.JOHNNYThey got that Conscription Act from Washington keeping them busy, but theywon't leave us alone forever. And the Natives is strong as they ever been!In the ring, Fighter 1 drives Fighter 2 to the deck again, and this timeKNOCKS HIM COLD.AMSTERDAM(indicates Fighter 1)You call that strong, John?In the ring, a couple of agitated NATIVE AMERICANS are trying to get atthe Rabbit-sponsored winner. RABBITS start to RUSH the ring but AmsterdamWAVES them back.AMSTERDAM(to Johnny)This is our time now!BARNUM(trying to make official announcement)The winner... gentlemen, please! ... the winner in the 39th round is theDead Rabbits champion, High Water Dobbs ... please, gentlemen!The unofficial ring COMBAT continues, knocking Barnum about, as the newchamp throws marauding Natives around like empty flower sacks. Amsterdamiumps into the fray, PUSHES some Natives away. They start for him but thechamp stands them off while Amsterdam WHISPERS to Barnum.BARNUMJust a moment, please, gentlemen! There's a word for us all. Amsterdampromises ...(Amsterdam whispers to him briefly)... something large, something grand, something epic. The greatest theseare my own words, of course the greatest righting of the gravest wrongever done in the Five Points.The crowd quiets, their sporting blood still up, curiosity engaged. OnlyJohnny seems glum, concerned.This is to be a duel not for money, but for honor! A fight to the death...AMSTERDAM(interrupting, emphasizing)To the death. If he can stand up to it.BARNUM... on which money, I hasten to add, may certainly be wagered. The namesof the two champions are Amsterdam Vallon, here beside me, and ... and Mr.William Poole, known to all as ...BILL THE BUTCHER(leaping up)They know me by any name, you son of a bitch!The crowd ERUPTS: this is a death match between Olympians. Only Johnnydoes not rejoice. He looks at Amsterdam's face, flush with the belief thatthe right moment has finally come, and he has to turn away. He walks awayfrom the ring as Killoran tries unsuccessfully to PULL the Butcher downand cool him off.BILL THE BUTCHER(yelling)I'll have him stretched on a spit!Killoran is beside him now, whispering urgently. Bill the Butcher shakeshis head vehemently.BILL THE BUTCHER(to Killoran)You got no more to say about this now.92 CONTINUED:AMSTERDAMCome on, Bill! Let go of your Tammany wet nurse!

Day after elections, we'll meet with secondson neutral ground to work out time and terms. It will be done and done.He walks to the ring, holds his HAND out to Amsterdam.BILL THE BUTCHERYou know this hand.

And it's Tammanyand the gangs who'll stop it. Isn't that so, Bill?BILL THE BUTCHER(nods at Johnny)I won't say nothin' in front of him. Who knows what business he's here on?BOSS TWEEDHe's here on our business and my invitation. He's already been of greathelp. What's the opposition strength, John?To answer, Johnny yanks back a CURTAIN drawn across a high window. Theview, looking downtown, is one of almost continual ILLUMINATION-- everyplace the eye falls, CANDLES burn in sympathy for the rioters.JOHNNYEach candle is against you, gents.MAYOR"Against you," sir? Don't you mean "us".JOHNNY(diplomatic)Some of us come from those people, Mayor. I'll not deny they still claimpart of me.MAYORWhich part? Perhaps your heart.BOSS TWEEDGentlemen, I'm sorry you find it necessary to question the loyalty of myfriend here, and by extension, my own judgement. So as proof ... John,where will the mob go? What will the gangs do?(Johnny is uneasy about answering)Go on, tell them what you told me.JOHNNYThere's no telling about the mob. Or the small gangs. But the Dead Rabbits... if I was Amsterdam...BOSS TWEED(interrupting)As indeed you nearly was. Were.JOHNNY... if I was ... I'd figure to take the Rabbits to the Armory.BOSS TWEEDWould you agree with that, Bill? Wouldn't you do the same? If you werefighting against the militia instead of beside them?BILL THE BUTCHERBeside them? What are you talking... ?BOSS TWEED(interrupting)You will have to fight beside them to take the Armory. It cannot fall intounfriendly hands.BILL THE BUTCHERI can't stand with the militia against the people. I could never work thePoints no more if I did.BOSS TWEEDWe're all of us swept up in a great tide of events, Bill. Have you learnedto swim?From Bill's face, struggling to make sense of this, knowing Tweed's rightbut not wanting to believe it, we ...DISSOLVE TO109 INT. MAIN ROOM/TAMMANY HALL NIGHT... Johnny's face, as Tweed talks to him. It is later, and the Butcher hasleft. The activity is still frantic all around, but Tweed speaks inunhurried tones.BOSS TWEEDI'm sure that Bill will do his usual splendid job. But after that ...well, I'm afraid he's grown away from us.(Johnny looks puzzled)He shows distressing signs of... shall we say, free-thinking. Crimeflourishes in chaos, and these riots could encourage Bill to overstephimself. He no longer inspires in me the same trust... well, that youmight. If you can prove yourself further.109 CONTINUED:JOHNNYYou already said in front of everyone you trusted me.BOSS TWEEDIn vital things. Would I be talking to you now otherwise? Vital things,but small things. Are you equal to greater responsibility and opportunity?JOHNNYSuch as what?BOSS TWEEDRidding me of Bill the Butcher.(Johnny is startled)He may question your loyalty to me, but Bill would never believe you hadthe sand to go against him. He'd never expect it. Do you have the sand?From Johnny's face, struggling to make the right answer, we...DISSOLVE TO110 INT. JACOB'S LADDER... Ansterdam's face, as he looks up from preparing a brace of pistols forthe next day's scheme.AMSTERDAMLet him in.Johnny enters the common room of Jaccb's Ladder, where the Dead Rabbitshave gathered to ready themselves. As they work over their weapons andprepare battle dress, Johnny walks through their midst. They do notacknowledge him... except for Jenny.JENNYDid you miss us, John?JOHNNYNot a bit.AMSTERDAM(rising to meet him)Are you here to spy?JOHNNYI don't have to spy.Amsterdam leads Johnny off to a shadowy corner of the room where they cantalk privately.JOHNNY(as they walk)I know what you're doing. I told Tweed what you're doing.AMSTERDAMYou don't know what I'm doing.JOHNNYYou're going after the Armory.AMSTERDAMAm I now? Why do you think that?JOHNNY'Cause that's what I would do, and you and I think alike.AMSTERDAMNo more. And it don't seem worth a visit to tell me something you alreadythink I'm doing.JOHNNYThere's something else alright. Tweed's arranged to kill Bill the Butcher.AMSTERDAM(disbelieving)Who could Tweed get to do that?JOHNNYOne of his own.AMSTERDAMThere's no one around him...JOHNNY(interrupting)Listen, it don't matter who, it's going to be done, that's all! Tweedain't going to wait aroundfor you and Bill to settle yourselves. I'm telling you so you have achance.AMSTERDAMChance of what?JOHNNYA chance... a chance to do what you want. Bury the Butcher, draw whatblood you got to. But you better make speed. The Natives will move on theArmory too.AMSTERDAMAnd what's any of it mean to you?JOHNNYIt means whatever's left of friendship, I don't know. There's still partof me here. I don'twant to see you lose everything in your life at once.AMSTERDAMI'm going to lose nothing.(beat)If you believe me, you can stay.JOHNNYI got to go.He turns so Amsterdam can't see his face and LEAVES-JENNYSo Tammany's going to kill the Butcher. That puts you and Tweed on thesame side. Does that make the path clear enough to suit you?From Amsterdam's face, trying to work out all the new angles, we...DISSOLVE TO111 INT. NATIVE AMERICAN HIDEOUT... Amsterdam's face, full of resolve, staring unblinking as ...... the barrels of two dozen RIFLES SURROUND the edges the screen, boxingAmsterdam in, as if his head were in a frame.And Bill the Butcher gazes at him with astonishment. We are, for the firsttime, in the Natives' lair, a house hung with American flags of all shapesand vintages, some of them torn by battle, others by years of weather anduse. Some of them go back to the early days of the republic. There is notan inch of wood or wall space to be seen for all the stars and stripes.BILL THE BUTCHERMurder Me? No one's going to murder me.AMSTERDAMThen you better learn to fight locking over your shoulder, Bill, becausethat's the only way you'll ever see it coming.BILL THE BUTCHERI don't believe it, and I don't believe it's you telling me. You got noreason to care about any danger to me.AMSTERDAMOne reason. You're my kill, Butcher. No one else is going to have you, notTweed, not Tammany, not those pigs in the street. No one--not even you,Bill--will ever take the pleasure of your death away from me. I'd doanything to keep you for my own, even if I have to protect you.BILL THE BUTCHERYou protect me? Get out of here and go to hell.AMSTERDAMFine, so long as I pass you on my way.BILL THE BUTCHERMaybe I'd believe you more if I knew who was talking to you.AMSTERDAMSomeone I credit.BILL THE BUTCHERThat means nothing to me. None of this means nothing to me because I amTammany. Without me and my Natives they're nothing but a bunch of oldhorses at a trough.AMSTERDAMYou join with me and we fight against Tammany, fight them back and out ofthe Points. Then you and me can settle. But if you don't join with me,then there won't be no settlement because you'll be murdered in the streetand the whole Points will be mine.BILL THE BUTCHERI relish the thought... just the thought... of cutting you up and openingyou wide. So if just thinking about it gives me such pleasure, imagine howI'm going to enjoy doing it.AMSTERDAMWhy don't I make it easy for you, then.He TURNS his back on the Butcher and starts to walk out, through theentire gang of Natives.AMSTERDAMSame as you're making it easy for Tweed.He keeps walking... through the Natives ... dozens of ancient enemiesglowering at him.BILL THE BUTCHERAmsterdam!(Amsterdam looks around)Don't be like your father. Don't make it too easy.Amsterdam struggles to keep his temper. But he turns and keeps walkingthrough the enemy camp as we...DISSOLVE TO112 INT. JACOB'S LADDER....Amsterdam walking. But this time, he is WALKING among his gang. Allthe Dead Rabbits are assembled, weapons ready. Jenny is beside him. ThenJimmy Spoils. Then a few others.As the group passes, others STAND and walk with them...... until the whole gang is rallied...... and bound for the passageway in the corner of the room that leadsunder the building.DISSOLVE TO113 INT. BASEMENTAs Amsterdam and the gang heads through the catacomb-like basement, pastthe graves, into a tunnel. Torchlight GUTTERS all around. Their steps echolike repeated rifle shots.DISSOLVE TO114 INT. TUNNELThe whole gang MARCHES down a tunnel under the Old Brewery. Except forAmsterdam and Jenny, they all wear their tamlas. Many have marks and ganginsignia on their faces. All of them have weapons. A lot of weapons.Frightened FACES--people seeking shelter and safety from the riots--appearin the darkness, then vanish like ghosts.As the Rabbits walk, they summon memories of the first fight, that samemarch through the tunnels when Amsterdam marched beside his father.Amsterdam's face gives little away. But perhaps he is remembering that daytoo.DISSOLVE TO115 INT. TUNNELThe last tunnel.. Shreds of light from a door in the distance. Amsterdamwalks up to the door and--just as Monk Eastman did years before--KICKS itdown. Dim dawn LIGHT FLOODS the tunnel as the Dead Rabbits step out.CUT TO116 EXT. CANAL STREET DAWNThe first thing we see is an ELEPHANT, who trumpets fearfully at thesudden sound of the sattere door. The gang stops, wary of this hugerefugee from Barnum's Museum, but the animal is more frightened of them.It hurries on down the street...... revealing behind it a group of several dozen RIOTERS who carry a hugeAmerican flag and a long wooden plank bearing the legend "No Draft." Theystare at the Rabbits with something near reverence.AMSTERDAMWhere's the Native Americans?RIOTERAin't seen them. Ain't here.AMSTERDAMAnd the militia?RIOTERThere's a detachment coming on from two streets over. The rest is stillnorth of here. What are you after?Amsterdam POINTS to a formidable building a block away: the Armory. Itlooks like a fortress.RIOTERThe Devil himself couldn't take that place.AMSTERDAMThat's why he sent us.CUT TO117 EXT. STREET NEAR ARMORY/ DAYThe DETACHMENT of militia proceeds warily towards the Armory. They are ayoung, uncertain-looking outfit; their COMMANDER looks like an upstatefarm kid. He tenses and his eyes widen as he sees Jenny walking towardhim, carrying a BOY in her arms.JENNY(crying)Help me. Oh please help me. He's shot, we need a doctor, please help.DETACHMENT COMMANDERMiss, we ain't a medical outfit. The main unit's ten minutes behind us,they'll have...He doesn't get the chance to finish. Jenny DROPS the Boy from her arms andshoots the Detachment Commander once, cleanly...... as the Boy roles into a prone position and FIRES two shots into thestunned Detachment...... while the Dead Rabbits SWARM from every doorway along the street,FIRING GUNS and brandishing weapons.It's over in seconds. The Detachment has hardly gotten off a shot. Everyone of them lies dead or wounded in the street...... as the Rabbits CROUCH over their bodies.CUT TO118 EXT. ARMORY DAYA rifle emplacement manned by a dozen GUARDS- They stand anxious post infront of the Armory. Each window is barred and fortified, and the frontdoor is massive. But the tension in the Guards' faces eases a little whenthey see ...... the Detachment of militia heading towards them down the street. Someof the Detachment are wearing bloody uniform jackets; several are beingcarried. The Detachment, unrecognized by the Guards, is made up entirelyof Dead Rabbits.AMSTERDAMHelp us, we got wounded!GUARD 1We can't leave the post.AMSTERDAMOpen the damn doors then! We're bad hurt!GUARD 1Where's the others?AMSTERDAMJust behind us! But I got our major here wounded so bad half his guts isout!Guard 1 SIGNALS for the doors to be opened to the Armory as the Detachmentdraws close to the emplacement.GUARD 1God, it's good to see you!AMSTERDAMLikewise.Ainsterdam SHOOTS him where he stands as the Rabbits OVERWHELM theemplacement.AMSTERDAM(shouting)Move fast! We got to get out with everything we can before the militiagets here!As the Armory Guards return fire, the Boy Jenny carried in the previousscene RUNS for the telegraph pole and starts to CLIMB. A SHOT makes thewood fly inches from his face...... as the Rabbits storm into the Armory, FIRING wildly.The Boy reaches the top of the telegraph pole and CUTS the wire. Heshinnies back down the pole as the wire SWINGS ineffectually in the airand we ...DISSOLVE TOINT. Y HALL/MAIN ROOM 119..a telegram, held in Killoran's hand. He passes it to Tweed.KILLORANIt's from the Armory Guards. That's the last before the wire went dead.BOSS TWEED(reading, furious)If the Rabbits are already at the Armory, where the hell is Bill and themilitia?He THROWS the telegram onto the floor, where it joins a whole SEA ofyellow telegraph forms. They are shin-high; there must be thousands ofthem.KILLORANThey got to be near.JOHNNYSo long as they're near, it's alright. The Rabbits can take the Armory,but they can't hold it. If Bill can get into position, he can make surethey don't get out.BOSS TWEEDAlright then, John, you pray to any God you choose that's the fact of it.If Bill thinks he can best the Natives, that is your opportunity. That isyour moment.(Johnny hesitates)Are you a Bible man? The Book says in Revelations, "I saw a new heaven anda new earth." If the hand of God's not on you to fulfill that prophecy,then the hand of Tweed will be. Go on and God bless.Johnny looks like he is about to say something, but he stops; looks atTweed a moment longer; then nods acknowledgment and leaves.GOVERNORI don't believe he can do it, Tweed.BOSS TWEEDOh, I think he can. Whether it's one man against another or a mob againstthe city, the mathematics remain the same. You never enjoyed theenlightenment of poverty, did you, Governor? If you had, you'd know youcan always hire half the poor to kill the other half.CUT TO120 EXT. ARMORY DAYA TREMENDOUS VOLLEY of GUNFIRE, as if to illustrate the Tweed theory ofclass warfare. Bodies fall in the street. Bodies fall from the Armory. Thebuilding is under siege by the main unit of the MILITIA and by Bill theButcher and the Natives. The Dead Rabbits are trapped.Johnny SNAKES through the Native American lines, over dead bodies, movingtowards Bill, who he sees a hundred yards away...... running over corpses of comrades and enemies toward the MILITIACOMMADER. As SHOT WIDENS, the carnage is revealed. Bodies of Natives, intheir uniform dusters, and Rabbits, in their tamlas, lie side by side inthe street.120 CONTINUED:FIRING continues from both sides as the Butcher shouts at the MilitiaCommander.BILL THE BUTCHERWe move now and we can drive them out! We press them and they'll break!MILITIA COMMANDERI can't spare the men or stand the risk! We stay fast and smoke lem out!BILL THE BUTCHERTweed put me in charge of this! I say we move, and by the crucified Christwe will move!(turns to his men)Native Americans, come with me! Any militia that wants to live uprightinstead of die hunkered down, come with us!Bill STALKS through the lines, rallying the men. And Johnny starts toFOLLOW.BILL THE BUTCHERWe'll show you gladiators' greatness! Come on!The men start to JOIN the Butcher; even some militia fall in. Johnny SLIPSthrough the men gathering near the Butcher. He's closer to Bill than ever.Bill starts to mount their BARRICADE. There is MOVEMENT and commotion allaround him as Natives and militia fall into rough formation. It threatensto obscure Bill from Johnny's view. Shield him.He has to make his move. NOW. He DRAWS a revolver as militia and Nativespass in front of him... he AIMS ... he's anxious, confused ... his HANDshakes ... he fires... too soon! ...... and HITS a Native, who falls dead. Right near Bill.The Butcher turns in the direction of the shot, SEES Johnny. Their eyeslock. Johnny FIRES again ... WINGS Bill ...... and Bill SHOOTS him. Johnny FALLS with the first shot. Bill's abovehim now, looking down at him.BILL THE BUTCHERWas it Tweed or your friend put you to this?JOHNNYTweed.Bill SHOOTS him again, point blank. Johnny screams.BILL THE BUTCHERYou'd lie to save your friend.JOHNNY(in terrible pain)No. There's no friends for me.BILL THE BUTCHERMe the same. Pity us both.He EMPTIES his revolver into Johnny.BILL THE BUTCHER(to his men)Hold your fire!(toward the Armory)In there! Hey in there! I want to talk to Amsterdam!The Militia Commander is aghast at this proposition and starts forward,gun in hand. But a Native STOPS him.Amsterdam's face APPEARS in a front window of the Armory.AMSTERDAMGo on, then, talk.BILL THE BUTCHERYou and me.AMSTERDAM(beat)Come ahead then. And bring my friend's body.Bill the Butcher SLINGS Johnny's body over his shoulder as easily as if itwere an empty sack of flour...... and starts walking thraugh the lines toward the Armory. The Militiawatches in disbelief, the Natives in confusion. The Dead Rabbits keep theButcher in their sights. But no one fires. No one moves.And Bill the Butcher enters the front doors of the Armory.CUT TO121 INT. ARMORY DAYAs the Butcher is admitted through the huge doors which clang SHUT quicklybehind him. It's a scene of devastation inside-dozens of dead and woundedeverywhere. And enough rifles and munitions to sink Manhattan island.Bill the Butcher stands dead center in the middle of the Armory floor asAmsterdam walks toward him. The Butcher DROPS Johnny's body in a heap athis feet.BILL THE BUTCHERYour friend made different friends lately.AMSTERDAMTammany's put us all in the same place. You want to get out alive?BILL THE BUTCHERIt don't matter to me. I got enemies outside, enemies in here. The militiacan move on me anytime. You could drop me before I get to the door.AMSTERDAMI don't want to lose you so easy. You'll never get past the militia unlessyou come with the Dead Rabbits.BILL THE BUTCHERYou'd lay aside what's between us?AMSTERDAMI'm not forgetting where I put it.BILL THE BUTCHERIf you do, I'll remind you.(he turns, leaves)AMSTERDAMWhat's your call, Bill?BILL THE BUTCHERI'm considering where's my better chance.He walks to the doors. The Rabbits guarding it don't make a move. He OPENSit himself and strides out into the street.CUT TO122 EXT./INT. ARMORY DAYBill walks alone toward the Native/militia lines.From inside... from every window ... the Dead Rabbits watch him.The sun is high, but the street is eerily quiet. There are FARAWAY SOUNDSof battle, but here there is only the sound of distant, unheardconversation between Bill, the Militia Commander and some Natives.Amsterdam WATCHES intently.The Butcher and the Militia Commander argue, but we still can't hear whatthey're saying. There is still no sound...... until, SUDDENLY, we see the Militia Commander's face. Huge. EYES WIDEwith surprise as we HEAR the thunderclap of a SHOT.Bill the Butcher has just gutshot the Militia Commander.As if the shot were a signal, the Natives TURN on the militia. It'shellish, close-quarter combat. Guns fired inches from enemies who had justbeen allies. Knives, swords, bludgeons, kids with dead-rat blackjacks,women with hob-nailed wooden planks, attacking better-armed but totallystunned soldiers.Bill the Butcher falls back toward the Armory, the Natives following him.Inside the Armory, Amsterdam turns to his own greatly diminished gang.AMSTERDAMGo ahead them, give them cover! Give them some damn cover!The Rabbits are so stunned to be fighting on the same side as their swornenemies that, even with Amsterdam's order, no one makes a move. It'sAmsterdam who FIRES the first shots. And that unleashes a great VOLLEYfrom the Armory...... toward the militia.The Butcher and the Natives are closer to the Armory now... and the Armorydoors start to open...... when a MILITIA LIEUTENANT SIGNALS ...... and MILITIA on the surrounding roofs, waiting for this moment,suddenly open fire...on the Natives below and on the Rabbits on the roofof the armory. Many drop in the street and fall from the Armory roof...... as the Armory doors SWING WIDE to admit the Natives. As they run orstagger inside, the Rabbits start to close the doors. Some Rabbits are cutdown by the fire from the rooftops. Other Natives never make it to thedoors. And a few are shot...... when the doors close before they can get through.CUT TO123 INT./EXT. ARMORY DAYThe Dead Rabbits keep firing, but they have sustained grave losses. TheButcher looks around at the Natives who have made it inside with him: hehas perhaps one-quarter of his original strength.BILL THE BUTCHERWell, it seems like between us we got two mobs that might make a gang.AMSTERDAMWhose gang might it be?BILL THE BUTCHERNot William Tweed's.Jimmy Spoils and a crew of Natives PUSH a cannon toward the rear of theArmory.AMSTERDAMWhich way you pointing that?JIMMY SPOILSAny way you say. One direction could let us out, the other will let themin.BILL THE BUTCHERThey got to come in if we're going to fight them.AMSTERDAMWho do you want to fight, Bill?Amsterdam MOTIONS toward the rear wall and Jimmy swings the cannon around.Everything surrounding them is MOVEMENT and COMMOTION as the remainingmembers of both gangs TAKE whatever weapons they can carry from the Armorystockpile...... and Jenny steps forward with a torch, LIGHTING the fuse of thecannon...... which ROARS and BLOWS a huge hole in the rear wall of the Armory.AMSTERDAM(to Bill the Butcher)See you in the street.The gang members RUSH for the opening, carrying whatever they can manage.Outside, the MILITIA LIEUTENANT hears the cannon blast... sees no damageto the front of the building... and SIGNALS for a frontal ASSAULT on theArmory.HIGH ANGLE FROM ABOVE, CAMERA MOVING as the militia CHARGES ... followingthem forward, then moving ahead to the Armory... SHOOTING straight down inside (no roof or ceiling) as the Gangs HURTLEthrough the still-smoldering hole in the wall ...... and drop twenty feet to an alley below...... where militia on the roof try to pick them off. As the militia pressescloser from the front, gang defenses start to fall back inside the Armory.Everyone wants to get through that hole.Amsterdam, Jenny, Jimmy Spoils and some of the other gang nembers arecarrying TORCHES. Jenny HANDS a torch to the Butcher. Amsterdam MOTIONSthem all toward the back of the Armory.But he stays behind. Just for a moment. He BENDS over the crumpled body ofJohnny Sirocco, ARRANGES it, folding JOHNNY'S HANDS across his chest.AMSTERDAMYou'll have a warrior's funeral anyway, John.He STANDS and RUNS for the hole in the wall, where Jenny and the othersstand waiting.He TURNS, takes a last look inside the Armory. The militia is BATTERINGDOWN the front doors. Then he raises his TORCH over his head... and HURLSit through the air. Jenny and the others do the same.His single torch BLAZES a path of light across the screen. The others,JOINING it, make a fiery CONSTELLATION.CUT TO124 EXT. REAR OF ARMORY/STREETS BEHIND ARMORY DAYAs Jenny, Jimmy Spoils, Bill the Butcher and Amsterdam HURTLE through thehole into the alley below...... and start to run through the withering GUNFIRE of the militia on theroof...... getting away... just barely away.As Jenny runs, her swag drops and FALLS from under her clothes. She TURNSto pick it up but Amsterdam PULLS her on....... and just away from the titanic EXPLOSION of the Armory. The CONCUSSIONthrows some of the militia from their perches on the roof. It sends afountain of FLAME and RUBBLE high into the sky. It is VOLCANIC in itsbrilliance and intensity. The sky turns BLACK with powder, BLAZING ORANGEwith flame.In the small streets BEHIND THE ARMORY, many gang members are CRUSHED bydebris or burned by FIREBALLS breaking off from the central flame.The Armory is gone. Much of the surrounding area is gone with it.On the ground, everything is smoke, flame, dirt, death, confusion, Corpseseverywhere. Gang members and kids running all over, desperate. It lookslike the last day of mankind on earth.Bill the Butcher HELPS a couple of fallen Natives, then SEES through thesmoke and flame and storm of ash ... Amsterdam.Coming towards him.BILL THE BUTCHERWe're finished, all of us.AMSTERDAMBut you and me ain't settled.BILL THE BUTCHERWe got the same now, a full share of nothing. There's nothing to settle.There's nothing left.Amsterdam takes a weapon from his pocket, OPENS it for the Butcher to see:it is the pirate's knife which the Butcher used to kill Priest Vallon.AMSTERDAMThen let's start over.Bill the Butcher looks tired, sorrowful. He BURIES his face wearily in hisarms. And for a moment we think he has given everything up. AmsterdamMOVES toward him, throu
