I've          a few bottles of the Old Winyard left,          1296...a very good year, almost as old as          I am. It was laid down by my father. What          say we open one, eh?Bilbo disappears into the kitchen as Gandalf looksaround..enjoying the familiarity of Bag End...he turns,knocking his head on the light and then walking into thewooden beam. He groans.                    BILBO (O.S.) (CONT'D)          I was expecting you some time last week.

BILBO (CONT'D)          Er, we've got raspberry jam and apple          tart...got some custard somewhere. Not          much for Afters, I'm afraid. Oh          no...we're alright...I've just found some          sponge cake. Nice little snack. Hope          it's enough.

BILBO (CONT'D)          I've got to get away from these          confounded relatives, hanging on the bell          all day, never giving me a moment's          peace. I want to see mountains          again...mountains, Gandalf... and then          find somewhere quiet where I can finish          my book...Oh, Tea!

He'd probably come with me if I          asked him. I think, in his heart,          Frodo's still in love with the Shire, the          woods and the fields... little rivers.
