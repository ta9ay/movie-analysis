                         SPARTAN                     a screenplay by                       David Mametcopyright (c) 2002by David MametFADE IN:EXT. WOODED HILLSIDE. DAY.We see the drawn face of a young woman. Camera tracks withher as she runs through the thick woods. She is exertingherself heavily as she moves up a steep hillside. She looksbehind her quickly, and continues.ANGLE, we see a young man, and then another, running throughthe woods, out of breath. They are dressed in filthy BDU's,and show several days growth of beard. The leader stops fora moment, and looks around. The two men separate.ANGLE, the  young woman, who has come to a small ledge, overa ravine.  She stops, panting, and bends over, to attempt tocatch her  breath. She looks around, and looks back, her backto a steep  wall, a steep drop before her.ANGLE, the first young man, having come up to the spotvacated by the young woman. In the BG we see his colleague.He looks down, and sees movement in the brush below him, inthe ravine. He starts to descend, and then looks up.ANGLE, the young woman, pulling herself up the steeprockface. The young man regains the ledge and looks up.Camera takes him around a bend in the ledge.Standing here we discover ROBERT SCOTT. He is somewhat olderthan the two men, he is very fit, also dressed in filthyBDU's. He is making a note in a small notebook, which hecloses. Now, the two men look across the ravine at the youngwoman, seen disappearing over a ridge.                       SCOTT                  (quietly)             ...you better catch her...The man looks around, and begins climbing up the rockfacebehind him, pulling himself up, hand over hand by the rootsof trees. Several feet up, he falls on his back. He tries towork himself to his knees and winces in pain. He looks toScott for help.                       SCOTT             ...your Dad's napping on the             sofa, your Mom's watching Let's             Make A Deal, and God is Dead.             What do you expect me to do...?                       YOUNG MAN                  (very weakly)             ...I'm tired, Sir...Sir, there's             no way...                                                              2.                      SCOTT            There's always a way...Don't You            tell me there's no way...A pause, as the man tries again to get to his feet. Scottlooks up at the young woman on top of the ridge and givesher a "hold" gesture. She stops, at his command. Scott nods,as if to himself, and then kicks the young man in the ribs.The man starts, his eyes grow, and he gets to his feet.                      SCOTT            How 'bout that? That's called            'Adrenaline'. You said you Wanted            In.He moves into the now-standing young man, and hits him, notheavily, but convincingly, several times.                      SCOTT            This is where you get in. The            mugger don't care. The shooter            don't care...get up...Or I will            beat you to death on this fucken            hill...Now: you better Catch her...He motions with his head. In the BG we see the young womannod, and begin running again. We see her, for a moment,breast a hill, and disappear again...ANGLE, on the young man, as he looks at Scott, empty, now,of self-pity, as if he just realized something.                      SCOTT                 (responding to his look.                 As if to say "That's right.")            There's nothing but the mission...The young man begins to climb the rockface.HOLD on Scott for a moment.INT. TRAINING FACILITY. DAY.A large, hand-painted sign hangs on the cinderblock wall ofthe rough building. It reads:                    These are the precincts of pain.                    A goddess lives here.                    Her name is Victory.In front of the sign walks the young woman we saw earlier.She is exhausted, she has a towel wrapped around her neck.Camera takes her to Scott, who is holding a cup of coffee,and making notes in the small notebook we saw earlier.                                                             3.She stands, waiting, as she finishes his note.                         SCOTT            Well done.                      YOUNG WOMAN (JACKIE BLACK)            A signal honor to work with you,            sir.                      SCOTT            Thank you, Sergeant.He starts away from her, and she raises her hand slightly,to indicate she has something more to say. He turns back to her.                      JACKIE BLACK            Sir: Day or Night. Black or White.            You reach out for me. "Black,            Jaqueline A. US 24191489."                      SCOTT            I'll remember, Sergeant.She nods, and walks off. Scott walks toward a mess tent. Heis joined by George Blane, a very military-looking figure ofan older man. He wears an informal fatigue outfit, mismatchedjacket and trousers, without insignia. Scott is greeted byhim, as they walk toward the mess tent. Scott shows thenotebook to Blane, and Blane refers from the notebook towhat we see are a group of eighty young men, in the messtent, two of them the men we saw on the hill. Blane takesthe notebook and walks off, as Scott enters the mess tent.ANGLE HIS POV, Scott enters the tent. Several of the youngmen react to him. He nods to them. Among them, we see theyoung man Scott berated on the hill, who rises and comesover to Scott.ANGLE, on Scott, who sits, as a uniformed man brings him atinfoil tray with some food on it. Scott takes out astiletto from his pocket, presses a button and the bladeemerges. He begins to use it to cut up his meat. The youngman from the hill, Anton, stands sheepishly near Scott, tillScott turns, acknowledging him.Anton takes a card out of his pocket, the size of a creditcard, old, creased cardboard: It reads, "Rogers Rangers,Rules for Engagement. 1782". There is a line drawing of aman with a musket, and we read, on the card, beneath it,boldtype rules for fighting guerilla style. Written on thecard, in old faded ink, "SGT. Anton, M. US. 3149584, UnitedStates Special Forces." The young man (Anton) shows the cardto Scott.                                                           4.                      SCOTT                 (of the card)            What's this then?                      ANTON            It was my father's, sir.                      SCOTT            He carry it Over There?As they speak, we see, in an insert, the printed rules -"Dated 1759". "Rule 4: Tell the truth about what you see andwhat you do - there is an army depending on us for correctinformation. You can lie all you please when you tell otherfolks about the Rangers, but don't never lie to a Ranger oran Officer".                        ANTON            Yes, sir.                      SCOTT            He come back?                      ANTON            Yes, sir. He did.                      SCOTT                 (nods. Pause)            Well, so.Scott pauses again. As he looks at the young man, who isobviously unable to express his gratitude, and sense ofoccasion.                      SCOTT            You carry that card, son. It            might save your life.                 (Anton nods)            ...You could use it to light a            fire, or something...Blane's Aide calls the men to order.                      BLANE'S AIDE            The Candidate Cadre will fall in            on the White Line...The men start to come to their feet, and leave the mess tent.                      ANTON            I just wanted to say, sir...That,            to meet you...                                                              5.                      SCOTT                 (rising, as he gives                 the Ranger card back                 to Anton)            You never met me. You've been up            for a week. You're seeing Snakes...The exhausted men come to their feet, and into a line. Theyare happy, and joking with one another. In the BG we seethose who failed the course, sitting apart, file onto a buswhich has just pulled up.ANGLE on a young man, who looks out of the window.ANGLE HIS POV. Twenty or so similarly exhausted men, withdufflebags, are being shuffled onto the bus.ANGLE, on the young man, Anton, as he exits the tent, whostands next to Scott, outside the tent. Scott stands next toan old, but pristine Mustang Cobra. He withdraws a smalldufflebag from the front seat, and looks up to see Antonstanding next to him.                       ANTON                 (looking after the                 departing, failed men)            ...I can't imagine how they live            with it...ANGLE on Scott. As he thinks a very brief moment, as ifreluctant to become philosophical, and then turns back to Anton.                      SCOTT            Make sure you can't imagine it,            cause, if you can, it's just one            step to doing it.Anton shakes his head, sadly, at the spectacle of the failedmen.                      SCOTT                 (pause)            ...they'll be back where they            came from by Morning, and all            this is just a Bad Dream.                      ANTON            My name is...                                                             6.                      SCOTT            Do I need to know?                 (pause)            If I want Camaraderie, I'll join            the Masons.                 (pause. Then, summing                 it all up:)            There's just the mission.Beat. Anton steps away.                      BLANE'S AIDE                 (as he glances down at                 his clipboard)            Congratulations on completion of            this evolution. I know you would            probably like some sleep, but I            do not think you'd mind sparing            ten minutes for Induction.The camera pans over the smiling faces of the eight veryproud young men.ANGLE on Blane and Scott, off to the side.Beyond them, we see the bus holding the failed candidates,filling up.                      BLANE            Thank you, Bobby.                      SCOTT            Not at all, Sir...                      BLANE            ...You going home?

We see various housefronts,and storefronts, and targets. A long table along one wallholds a coffee urn. Blane draws two cups of coffee.Through the open door we see Anton and Grossler, smiling,entering the building. Anton comes into the room, and smilesat Scott.We see Scott look away, sadly. He shares a look with Blane,drains his coffee cup, crumples it, throws it away. Blanegestures to Scott, meaning, "Shall we begin?" Scotthesitates for a moment, and then nods.FOCUS.ANGLE, on Scott, in the BG, as Blane steps forward toaddress the two candidates.

It is an altered shot showing the young girl withshort, spikey platinum hair.ANGLE on Scott, dressed in a clean shirt, a tie, as he takesa photo from the box.

Scott takes outseveral more bills and passes them to the Bartender.                                                               33.He hesitates a second, as if to say   "You wouldn't fuck me,would you...?" The Bartender signs,   "I am your man", theBartender takes the bills and leans   close and whispers toScott, indicating someone over in a   dark corner.In this corner, as the lights are flicked up, we see ayoungish man in very expensive casual clothes, an American,dressed like Eurotrash, sitting talking with the man we sawearlier was the Manager. As Scott approaches, we see theManager, knowingly, drift off. Beat. The young man (ZIMMER)rises from the booth, and tugs himself into neatness, andstops, as if bemused by Scott.                      ZIMMER            'Howdy, Pard'.                       SCOTT            Hello. I wonder if you could            help me...

SCOTT                 (gestures at the Bartender)            ...my friend says that            you're...you're sort of a            'matchmaker'...                      ZIMMER            Izzat what he says...?Camera takes the two out of the front of   the club, whereZimmer tips the bouncer, who his putting   on his coat,preparatory to going away for the night.   Zimmer beginswalking into a parking lot, where we see   several run-downemployee's cars, and his, Zimmer's prime   Mercedes. Scotttags along.                      BOUNCER                 (as he walks away, to                 Zimmer, of Zimmer's car)            I put her back in your space...

SCOTT            My, my, my, my, my, my question            was: why would a young girl want            to go out with an older man like            me? And, if you could "answer"            that...He takes out money from his pocket. Zimmer begins to speakslightingly, dismissively to the 'hick'.                      ZIMMER            Look, Bub...Zimmer starts to open his car door. He turns back to Scott,and we see, Zimmer's POV, Anton, standing behind Scott, atthe doorway to an alleyway. Obviously backing Scott up.ANGLE CU, Zimmer reacts infinitesimally, to the sight of Anton.ANGLE XCU, Scott, sees him, and slams him against the sideof the car. Zimmer reaches through the half-open door, andcomes out with an automatic pistol in his hand. Scott kickshim in the stomach, Zimmer tries to raise the hand with thegun, and Scott throws him to the ground, the pistol falls onthe concrete.ANGLE on Scott as Anton emerges from the alley. Scottdirects him to drag Zimmer into the alleyway, near adumpster. Anton thrusts his hand into the car and starts toreach for the dropped pistol.

She is struggling mightily. Scott has hishand over her mouth.ANGLE. We see their feet moving through a pool of oil on theconcrete floor - we see she loses her footing. We see Scotttighten his grip on her, and is furiously trying to calm her.                       SCOTT            Shussh, baby... shussh...            shussh... it's going to be            alright...We see him work a small hypodermic kit from the pocket ofhis jacket. We see Laura see it, and her eyes grow wide.                      SCOTT            This's going to make Everything            Allright...Laura reacts to the hypodermic, which Scott is bringingtoward her. And screams.                        LAURA            No!EXT. THE HANGAR AREA.We see Stoddard, and his men, about to get into their Jeep,stop, and turn at the sound.ANGLE INT. The Hangar Area. Signs all over marked in Arabicand English - "Petrol - No Smoking!!"As Scott lunges after Laura, the door, behind her burstsopen, and Stoddard and an accomplice enter, placing Laura,in the midst of the hangar, between Stoddard and Scott. Whostands in front of a large tanker labelled "Aviation Gasoline".                                                            129.                      STODDARD            Leave her Alone.                 (to his men)            Don't shoot him, don't shoot,            you'll blow the thing sky high...                         SCOTT            Laura...                      STODDARD            Thank God we Found you. You know            me. I work for Mister Burch.            I've met you...ANGLE on Laura, standing between the two men. She iscompletely confused. She looks from one to another.                      LAURA                 (drugged and groggy)            He said that he came to get me...                 (she shakes her head                 in disbelief. Then she                 starts to walk a step                 toward Scott, then                 turns, and proceeds                 toward Stoddard.)                      STODDARD            That's right, Laura...Walk away            from him. Walk to the Plane...He            can't hurt you now. Walk to the            plane...He points at his bizjet, outside, on the tarmac. Laura walks,unsteadily, in the direction pointed, and we see a femaleattendant, in a vaguely military getup, get out of the plane,and begin to walk toward Laura.                         SCOTT                    (screams)            No...He starts toward Laura. And Stoddard and his two meninterpose themselves between Scott and Laura, who isapproaching the plane. Stoddard's two men approach Scott.One draws a knife.ANGLE on Scott, who hangs his head, wearily. He looks downat his empty hands.ANGLE on the man with the knife, approaching him.                                                           130.ANGLE on Scott, straightening himself, as if submitting tothe inevitable, as the man with the knife draws closer. Hemakes a thrust, and covers. Scott steps toward him and spitsat him, full in the face. The man with the knife recoils fora moment, and Scott disarms him, throws him viciously to theconcrete floor, and stomps on him. Scott bends to pick upthe knife the man has dropped, and turns to face the otherman. As he does so, he slips on what we see is a large poolof oil on the floor. He goes down heavily. And the secondman steps into him as he falls, drawing his pistol.                      STODDARD            DON'T SHOOT, DON'T SHOOT, DON'T            SHOOT HIM IN HERE...The man uses the pistol to cuff Scott, who is attempting torise to his knees, behind the ear. Scott falls.                      STODDARD            Cuff 'im...The man handcuffs Scott behind his back.ANGLE on Scott shaking his head to clear it, as he nowstruggles to his knees.ANGLE, his POV.

SCOTT                 (as he speaks he moves,                 slightly, continuously,                 to get a better view                 of the girl)            ...why can't the Girl Go Home?                      STODDARD (CU)            Because she's dead.                 (pause)            You had to know the Secret            Knowledge. Didn't you?                                                         131.                      SCOTT            What is the Secret Knowledge?                      STODDARD            The Secret Knowledge is: There            Is No Secret Knowledge.

And the Gods Are Angry.ANGLE. On the tarmac. Laura, walking toward the plane, thepetroleum storage hangar behind her. We see a vaguelymilitary uniformed woman fall into step beside her and takeher arm. Laura looks at her. We see Laura full face, andjust the shoulder of the woman escorting her. Beyond them wehear the engine of the bizjet start up.                      LAURA            ...I'm so tired.                      WOMAN            ...I'm going to ask you to do            Just the One More Thing...Laura looks at her questioningly.                      WOMAN            I'm going to ask you, now, to            walk away from this plane, and            come with me.ANGLE, to show that the stewardess, who descended from thebizjet (the vaguely military clad young woman we saw earlier)is still on station outside of the bizjet, and that thewoman who is walking and talking with Laura is Jackie Black,the young female sergeant we met earlier. Laura looks at heruncomprehendingly. Laura begins shaking her head pathetically,and protesting, drawing away from Jackie Black.                      LAURA            No...leave me alone. No - I don't            know you...ANGLE, INT. The Petroleum Hangar. Day.                                                            132.
