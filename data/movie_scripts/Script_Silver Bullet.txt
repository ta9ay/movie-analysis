ARNIE Stuck tighter'n dogshit in a deep freeze!He takes the bottle of beer from his back pocket and fishesa churchkey from one of the front ones. He pops the cap anddrinks deeply. He burps. Then he screws the half-emptybottle of beer into the cinders so it won't fall over. Thenhe picks up his crowbar.CREDITS CONTINUE.EXT. THE RAIL-RIDER NIGHTThere's a SOUND of bushes shaking. Something comes out -something huge. It leaps limberly onto the rail-rider. It isa werewolf with greenish-yellow eyes. Tatters of clothesstill hang from it.What kind of monster, exactly? It is humanoid as well aswolfish... and when we learn who it is in its human form, weshould be able to spot the resemblance at once...and kickourselves for not knowing earlier.It crouches there, huge and bushy and fanged and deadly, onthe whole rail-rider.CREDITS CONCLUDE.EXT.

TARKER'S MILLS NIGHT - MOONLIGHTWe're looking at Main Street of a small country town - mightbe New England, might be mid-South. Might be 1984, might be1981. This is Tarker's Mills, and in places like this, timemoves more slowly. Cars - not too many - move back andforth. No one is in a hurry.We see the Methodist church (and the parsonage next door);Andy's Sporting Goods; Owen's Pub, with its Narragansettneon sign. We see a barber shop with a striped pole; we seethe Holy Family Catholic Church and the rectory next door.We see the Gem Theater, which is showing a revival of SophiaLoren in "Two Women."It's Our Town, U.S.A. JANE (voice-over) This place is Tarker's Mills, where I grew up... and this is how it was when I was fourteen - a place where people cared about each other as much as they cared about themselves. This is how my town looked as, all unknowing, it approached the rim of the nightmare. The killing had begun.SOUND: The HOWL of the WEREWOLF - distant, a bit dreamy.EXT./INT. TARKER'S MILLS MONTAGE NIGHTa.) VIRGIL CUTTS, owner of Virgil's Texaco, is filling up acar. We hear the HOWl... and VIRGIL looks up uneasily.b.) In the barber shop, BILLY McCLAREN, the barber, is justtaking the apron off the Methodist minister, REV. O'BANION.They both look around.c.) Folks are coming out of the Gem Theater. They pause atthe sound of that HOWL and look toward the edge of town.EXT. THE SETTING MOON, CU NIGHTAs JANE speaks, we see the moon sink below the horizon. JANE (v-o) The killing had begun, but at first no one knew it. Arnie Westrum was a chronic drunk, and what happened seemed like an accident.EXT. THE RAIL-RIDER AND ARNIE'S HEADLESS BODY NIGHTSlowly the view improves, grows lighter, as we TIME-LAPSE TODAWN.SOUND: A train is approaching. We hear its horn.CAMERA MOVES IN. Here is a shattered Rheingold bottle. Thereis a litter of ARNIE'S tools. And here, on the cheek ofARNIE'S severed head, a few ants are checking things out.SOUND: The train's horn, MUCH CLOSER. JANE (v-o) The county coroner concluded that Arnie passed out on the tracks. There wasn't enough evidence to conclude anything else.And suddenly the train comes smashing into the frame, hornblaring. The rail-rider goes flying. ARNIE'S body disappearsunderneath. We see something flopping and moving underthere. It could be a bundle of rags. Could be... but isn't. DISSOLVE TO:EXT. TARKER'S MILLS TOWN COMMON DAYThe common is more or less in the center of town, eithersurrounded by Main Street commerce or backed by it. THECAMERA MOVES SLOWLY IN on a big tent that's been erected onthe Common - looks like a revival meeting tent, almost, butthe banner draped over the entrance reads: SUPPORT THETARKER'S MILLS MEDCU DRIVE!Behind or to the side, on the grass, picnic tables have beenset out end-to-end. Women are putting salads and home-bakedbreads on these - just about the whole town is going to sitdown to a meal when the meeting's over. Further off, men aretending barbecues, roasting corn, etc. JOE HALLER (amplified voice) I'd like to give you Father Lester Lowe, of Holy Family Catholic Church!Enthusiastic applause greets this.INT. THE CROWD DAYMost of the town is here, seated on folding chairs. We'relooking particularly at three people - NAN COSLAW, herhusband BOB, and their fourteen-year-old daughter, JANE. Itis JANE - a slightly older JANE - who we have heardspeaking. She is now a bit bored with the meeting, which hasbeen going on for some time. As the APPLAUSE CONTINUES, sheleans toward her mother. JANE I'm going out for a while, 'kay? NAN All right. Stay close. And make sure your brother's all right.As JANE gets up, the applause starts to fade a bit.NOTE: JANE is wearing a silver crucifix, and will continueto wear it through the whole movie.INT. THE PODIUM DAYTo one side is a big black-and-white photograph on an easel.It shows a van which has been customized into an emergencymedical unit.Behind the podium are four chairs. REV. TOM O'BANION sits inone of them. ANDY FAIRTON sits in another, red-faced andbeaming. JOE HALLER, the town constable, is just returningto his; LESTER LOWE is just approaching the mike as theapplause dies. LOWE'S face shines with love and goodwill. LOWE For the last ten years...No amplification. He taps the mike.INT. JANEShe is making her way down the row to the aisle (the peopleshould be seated in folding chairs). She passes a GIRL ofabout her own age who has overheard NAN'S parting shot. GIRL (mocking) "Make sure your brother's all right." JANE (low) Marty's a booger.She reaches the aisle and starts out.INT. THE PODIUM, FEATURING FATHER LOWEHe taps the mike again.INT. THE CROWD, FEATURING BOB AND NAN COSLAW BOB (good-natured) Just pretend you're in your own church askin' for money, father! It'll work fine!Good-natured laughter greets this.INT. LOWE AT THE PODIUMA bit flustered, he taps the mike and is rewarded by a BRIEFSCREAM OF FEEDBACK. LOWE For the last ten years, I have had a dream. A dream of a time when modern medical care would come to this small community, which sometimes seems so far from Durham, with her lifesaving hospitals. I hope that this meeting, at which I see so many of my friends gathered, will be the start of making my dream come true.SOUND: Enthusiastic applause.EXT. A SNAKE IN THE GRASS, CUIt's a blacksnake... harmless, but big. It goes wrigglingthrough the grass toward a stream. In the b.g. - SOUND OFAPPLAUSE. MARTY (voice) Holy...! Brady, are you sure they're not poisonous? BRADY (voice) Little old blacksnake? Hell, no!Hands - the rather grimy hands of a boy bent on mischief -grab the blacksnake.EXT. MARTY AND BRADY, CUBRADY holds the snake up. Both boys gaze at it withrespectful wonder.NOTE: MARTY is wearing a silver St. Cristopher's medallion,and will through the whole movie. MARTY Lemme hold him!BRADY hands it over. As MARTY looks at the snake, BRADYsees:EXT. JANE, COMING OUT OF THE TENT DAY JANE (v-o) I was almost fifteen that summer. My brother Marty was eleven. Marty and his friend Brady Kincaid were the crosses I had to bear. Brady was actually the worse of the two, but I was rarely disposed to see that. Not when my younger brother was so constantly thrown in my face by my parents. LOWE (v-o from the tent) $32,000 is a lot of money. But when you think of the lives this unit might save, it seems very inexpensive indeed.Applause greets this.EXT. MARTY AND BRADYAgain we are fairly tight on the boys - we see them fromwaist or chest height. BRADY snatches back the snake. BRADY I got an idea. MARTY What?BRADY looks toward JANE. MARTY follows his gaze. His eyeswiden. MARTY You wouldn't.BRADY grins. MARTY assesses the grin. MARTY You would.INT. THE PODIUM, WITH LOWE LOWE An endeavor like this seems to me to be the very definition of community - all of us pulling together as one, farmers and merchants... Protestants and Catholics...EXT. JANEShe is walking slowly toward the picnic area, and is passingunder a tree. There's more applause from the tent. BRADY (teasing voice) Jane... Jane...She looks up. The blacksnake dangles down toward her, almosttouching her upturned face.JANE shrieks and bolts. She gets a little way, trips overher own feet and falls down hard. She's wearing what was anice jumper and nylons. Now the jumper is torn and the hoseshredded at the knees.EXT. THE TREE, WITH BRADYHe's lying over a limb with the snake in his hand, laughingwildly.EXT. JANEShe gets up, looks at her clothes, her bloody knees. She'snear tears.EXT. MARTY, AT ONE SIDE OF THE TREE, FAIRLY TIGHTThe shot's from the chest up. He looks sorry he was a partof this little stunt, as he ought to be. MARTY It was just a blacksnake, Jane-EXT. JANEShe looks around at him in a fury of embarrassment andsomething very close to hate. JANE Look at my knees! Look at my dress! I hate you!EXT. BRADY, UP IN THE TREE BRADY Did wittle Janie make wee-wee in her teddies?EXT. MARTY MARTY Stop it, Brady.EXT. BRADY, UP IN THE TREEHe throws the snake.EXT. JANEShe dodges the snake with a little scream. She's beginningto cry, but she flips BRADY the bird just the same.EXT. BRADY, IN THE TREE BRADY Ooooh, naughty!EXT. MARTYHe moves toward JANE - there is something queerly unnaturalin this movement, and in a moment we'll understand, but forthe time being we must be puzzled. MARTY Jane, I'm sorry. It was just a joke. We didn't mean-He's reached her. JANE is sobbing now, hysterical. JANE Oh, no! You never mean to! I hate you, you booger!She runs away.EXT. THE TREE, WITH BRADYHe swings down and comes over to MARTY. BRADY (with satisfaction) Really got her goat that time.EXT. MARTYHe's in a wheelchair, looking glumly after JANE. MARTY Oh, shut up, Brady. You're warped.EXT. NEAR THE BANDSTAND, FEATURING JANE DAYShe's walking slowly along, still crying a little. Now shesteps behind some bushes, looks around, hikes up the skirtof her jumper, and wriggles out of the wrecked panty hose. STELLA RANDOLPH (voice) Wait! Don't go!Startled, JANE looks around, instinctively yanking her dressdown. No one in sight. MAN (voice; rough) Just leave me alone!Now she looks toward:EXT. THE BANDSTAND, JANE'S POVA man who looks like he might be a traveling salesman whohas just stepped whole and breathing from a dirty joke aboutthe farmer's daughter comes striding down from thebandstand.STELLA RANDOLPH, a plump but sweetly pretty girl, comes tothe stairs but does not descend them.

ON THE BANDSTANDSTELLA has retreated to one of the benches, where she isbawling into a handful of Kleenex. Pudgy and twenty-two, sheis both funny and terribly sad. She looks around at thesound of JANE's voice. STELLA (alarmed) Who - ? JANE (approaching closer) It's Jane, Stella. Jane Coslaw.STELLA sees it is, and turns away from her, still weeping.JANE stands, uncertain what to do next. After a moment sheapproaches closer and touches STELLA'S turned back timidly.

NAN I want you two to bury the hatchet. You're being very silly, Jane. JANE (hot) Did you see my knees? MARTY Jane, I- NAN I think you're being mean as well as silly. Your brother has never had a scraped knee in his whole life.Well, here it is - the chief source of JANE'S animus againsther brother and the source of most of the tension in theCOSLAW family.MARTY winces and turns away a little, embarrassed - thisalways happens. He doesn't like it, but he doesn't know howto make his parents - his mother in particular - quit it. JANE You always take his side because he's a cripple! Well, it's not my fault that he's a cripple!

Uncle Al gave it to me- JANE (scorn) That drunk! MARTY -but I want you to have it.He gives her a warm, melting smile. When your little brotheris being good to you it's time to watch out - but JANE hasbeen lulled. She starts to open it, then looks questioninglyat him. MARTY Yeah, go ahead.She opens it.

THE DEN, WITH NAN AND UNCLE AL NIGHTUNCLE AL is clearing up in a kind of drunken stupor- and Imean he is really drunk. He's smoking one cigarette; anotheris smoldering away in the heaping ashtray. He drops a pileof baseball cards on the floor and bonks his head on thetable bending down to pick them up. NAN I don't want you drinking around Marty. That's too much. If you can't stop it, you better stay away.AL straightens up. There is a sort of command force in thisman, and here he is partly able to rise above his abysmaldrunkenness so we can see it. UNCLE AL I come here because Marty needs a friend. NAN Yes... you've always been that to him. But if you can't leave your booze in whatever dump you call home, you better just stay away.She leaves the room, almost crying. UNCLE AL looks afterher, and then his attention is drawn to the smolderingashtray. He pours beer over the mess, putting out the firebut creating something that looks even worse.

And it ain't animals that try to confues the law; it's people do that. ANDY FAIRTON Law around here don't need much confusing.PETE looks around at this. Being the deputy constable andineffectual by nature, he's pretty sensitive. ANDY (deep disgust) Joe Haller couldn't find his own ass if someone rammed it full of radium and gave him a Geiger counter.

Engraved on it in Old English letters is theword "rotgut." He spins the cap and takes a quick knock. Hepauses and glances at MARTY, who looks deeply stunned. JANE (v-o continues) ...they didn't at all mind drafting him. As to the sort of comfort Uncle Al may have been able to offer him...UNCLE AL hands the flask to MARTY.

LOWE If there are times when we feel alone and afraid, only small creatures in the dark, then these are the times when we must turn to one another for our comfort and our hope. To our neighbors. To our community. To our love for each other. I alone cannot ease the pain for Herb and Naomi Kincaid, nor can I ease your pain, nor you ease mine. But if I believe anything it's this: we can comfort each other. We can heal each other. We can go on together.INT. THE CONGREGATION, WITH MARTY AND TAMMYThe kids are crying. MARTY puts an arm around TAMMY and sheputs her head on his shoulder.INT. FATHER LOWE LOWE The Bible tells us not to fear the terror that creepeth by night or that which flieth by noonday, and yet we do... we do. Because there is much we don't know, and we feel very small. But we must not be alone. We must not allow ourselves to be alone, for there is the wide gate to the hell of terror. Turn to each other. Join hands in your sorrow and try to remember that the face of the beast always becomes known. (Pause) The time of the beast always passes. (Pause) Let us pray.EXT.

Her father was killed that night.UNCLE AL looks at him doubtfully for a moment, as if almostbelieving. Then he shakes his head. UNCLE AL Marty, you have to get this idea out of your head. Psychotics are more active when the moon is full, and this guy is a psycho. He's going to turn out to be as human as you or me. (Pause) In a manner of speaking.

JOEHALLER is in extremely bad shape. He hasn't come back muchfrom the murder of BRADY. I believe he is having some sortof spiritual crisis, and while it is not our purpose toexplore what it might be- this is, after all, a horror movieand not a John Cassavetes film- we can see that it hasseriously weakened his authority. ANDY (continuing) Moonrise at 8:52 p.m.Some nervous laughter greets this. Meanwhile, HALLER andPETE are working their way to the front, where they end upnext to a grim-faced HERB KINCAID.

HALLER I can't remember deputizing a single one of you!INT. ANDY FAIRTON ANDY That's right, Joe- the only deputy you got is that fat shitbag beside you, and neither one of you has done a damn thing about solving this case.There is a mutter of agreement.INT. A SLIGHTLY WIDER SHOT, FEATURING ANDY AND HALLERANDY hops off the bar to face HALLER directly. In the b.g.we see HERB KINCAID (KINCAID, by the way, should be wearinga black armband- he's come directly from his son's funeral). HALLER (without much force) We'll catch him. ANDY You couldn't catch a cold.HALLER looks at him for a moment, then turns to look at thecrowd. They look rather like a lynch mob; on their faces wesee an uneasy mix of shame and eager determination. HALLERspeaks with a kind of haggard, fading desperation. HALLER The law has a name for what you men are planning. It's private justice, and private justice is about a step and a half away from lynch mobs and hang ropes. I'm no J. Edgar Hoover, but I am the law in Tarker's Mills, and I want you men to go home.They shuffle their feet uneasily; many look down. He isgetting to them. ANDY Don't let this guy scare you! What's he done since this thing started but hang his face out?It's not working. Many of the men look disgusted with bothANDY and themselves. ANDY (louder) He ain't got so much as a fingerprint! OWEN KNOPFLER Ah, shut up, Andy. ANDY Don't tell me to-HERB KINCAID steps forward. HERB Yes. Correct. Shut up.ANDY, surprised and bewildered, does. HERB turns and looksgrimly at JOE HALLER, who can barely meet his gaze. HERB (quietly) I just came from my boy's funeral. HALLER Herb...I know how upset- how grief-stricken you must be...but- HERB (quietly) He was torn apart.Utter silence in OWEN'S place now. The others are staring,rapt. HALLER Yes. Yes, but- HERB (still quiet) Upset, you say. Grief-stricken, you say. Constable, you don't know what those words mean. My son was torn to pieces. To pieces!HERB turns to the others in the pub. Tears stream down hisface. HERB My son was torn to pieces! (turning back to HALLER) You come in here and talk to these men about private justice. You dare to do that. Constable Haller, why don't you go out to Harmony Hill and dig up what's left of Brady and explain to him about private justice. Would you want to do that?HALLER makes no reply. He looks down at his feet. HERB No. I thought not. (to the others) You folks stay here if you want. I wouldn't ask anyone to do anything that runs counter to his conscience. As for me... I'm going out and hunt up a little private justice.ANDY FAIRTON has swelled up again. He grins poisonously atthe slumped HALLER. He pushes off after HERB KINCAID. Othermen start to follow.EXT. OWEN'S PUBMen are streaming out, getting into station wagons andpickup trucks. Engines roar into life. They begin backingout even as more men come out of the pub. We even hear somehigh-spirited yells; they are on their way and their bloodis up.INT. OWEN'S PUBLESTER LOWE, looking more distressed than ever, pushes hisway through the men toward the door, and THE CAMERA FOLLOWS.He grabs BILLY McCLAREN. LOWE Billy... Billy, this is a bad idea. Joe can... BILLY (not looking at LOWE) Joe's had his chance, Father. Leave me be.He pushes outside. LOWE looks around wildly; his face sayshe can't believe this is happening. He grabs PORTERZINNEMAN, then, as PORTER shoves by him, at a couple ofothers with mounting desperation.HALLER makes his way to LOWE through the thinning crowd anddraws him aside. HALLER Let them go. LOWE But- HALLER This is that spirit of community you were talking about. Grand, ain't it? Maybe they'll shoot a hitchhiker or something and Andy can mount the head and raffle it off. To benefit the Medcu van, of course.HALLER laughs. LOWE But can't we do anything?OWEN KNOPFLER hurries past them; he has a rifle over oneshoulder in a sling. In his left hand he carries thepeacemaker bat. HALLER Sure. We can pray to Christ that none of them get killed.EXT. OUTSIDE OWEN'SMore cars and trucks pull away. There's a big old Ford"woody" wagon still there, with ANDY FAIRTON standingimpatiently by the driver's side door. BILLY McCLAREN andBOBBY ROBERTSON are with him, and a big, solid-looking womannamed MAGGIE ANDREWS.OWEN comes out and crosses to the woody. ANDY Well, it's about frigging time! They'll have his hide tacked to somebody's barn door before we get out there!They pile into the car, ANDY behind the wheel. He throws itinto gear and backs out onto Main Street.EXT. MAIN STREET, A NEW ANGLEWe see a parade of cars and pickup trucks headed out oftown.EXT. FATHER LESTER LOWEHe's standing on the curb and watching them leave town inprocession, some honking their horns, others yellingcheerfully. The expression on his face is dark and brooding.EXT.

The seat of his pants is badly snagged.The brothers are on the verge of a wooded area. We can seeground mist creeping around the bottoms of the trees. ELMER Help me Porter, goddammit!PORTER grabs ELMER'S right arm and pulls. There's a RIPPINGSOUND. ELMER screams. ELMER Don't pull me! You want to rip the right cheek of my ass right off? PORTER Well, Elmer, there are folks that'd say you've been half-assed most of your- ELMER Are you going to unhook me or be a wise guy?PORTER begins to pick the barbed wire out of ELMER'S pants.EXT. IN THE WOODS, WITH REV.

The bottom isfilled with a still ground mist. A few bushes poke out ofit. There are woods on the far side. ANDY (pointing across) It came from over there. BOBBY ROBERTSON As far as I could tell, it could have come from anywhere. ANDY We'll spread out in a skirmish line. If the bastard tries to go around us, we'll hear him. BOBBY I dunno- MAGGIE I think Bobby Robertson here's making lemonade in his pants. That lemonade got ice cubes in it, Bobby?ANDY FAIRTON and EDGAR ROUNDS laugh. ASPINALL and BILLYMcCLAREN smile a little. OWEN (quietly) Let off him, Maggie. I'm scared, too. BOBBY (stoutly) I ain't scared! Let's go! ANDY Okay. Spread out on me. Five feet apart.EXT. ANDY'S GROUP, FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE RAVINEReading from right to left: OWEN KNOPFLER (his gun is stillover his shoulder; it is the peacemaker baseball bat he isholding), BOBBY ROBERTSON, ASPINALL, ANDY FAIRTON, BILLYMcCLAREN, EDGAR ROUNDS and MAGGIE ANDREWS.They come slowly down toward THE CAMERA, alert and ready foranything- at least, they think so.EXT. ANDY'S GROUP, ANGLE SHOTThey reach the bottom of the ravine and begin to make theirway across it. The mist is waist to chest deep. They pushtoward the other side. Now they are about halfway.SOUND: A STEADY, LOW GROWLING, CLOSE.They all stop, scared. BILLY McCLAREN Where's it coming from? Other side? BOBBY No- it's behind us. I told you you couldn't trust- ASPINALL It isn't on either side. ANDY What are you-ASPINALL is looking around, his eyes widening with fear. ASPINALL It's under the fog.

EDGAR ROUNDS, CLOSEHe's the one screaming, and if he reminds us of O'BANION,that's okay, because ROUNDS has also been caught in a trap.He tries to run, stumbles, falls into the ground fog. Hegoes on screaming. We can see his back for a moment, andthen it disappears.SOUNDS OF CRUNCHING AND SCREAMING.ROUNDS SHRIEKS. His hand and arm come up like the hand of adrowning man. Then it's gone.

OWEN (voice) Come on, you bastard!The peacemaker rises out of the mist again. The handsholding it are bloody. Blood runs down the bat. It descends.Bonk! The WEREWOLF roars again.

HOLY FAMILY CATHOLIC CHURCH, PULPIT POV MORNINGIt's an almost exact reprise of #167. Most of the mournersare crying; MRS. BOWIE playing the organ; MARTY'S chairparked at the back. We can see UNCLE AL, MARTY, TAMMY, andMRS. STURMFULLER, exactly as they were at BRADY KINCAID'Sfuneral; in fact, this seems to be an instant reply of thatevent. One difference: we can't see BRADY'S coffin. It'sbelow us. The hymn ends.INT. FATHER LOWE, IN THE PULPIT LOWE Mr. and Mrs. Kincaid have asked that there be no mass said here this afternoon.

Only private justice.INT. LOWE, AT THE PULPITHe's thrown off his stride. Beginning to sweat. He's like anactor trying to remember his lines. LOWE Uh, if there's any word of comfort I can give you, it's just this: the face of the beast always becomes known; the time-He looks down. His eyes widen in fear.INT. THE COFFINS, LOWE'S POVYes, that's coffins- plural. Where BRADY'S coffin wasformerly, there are now six coffins, smothered with flowers.INT.

CONGREGATION Sowing in the morning/sowing seeds of kindness/sowing in the noontide/and the dewy eve...We pan their faces, stopping on JOE HALLER. Now something ishappening to JOE'S face. It is bulging, changing. He looksup from his hymnal and his eyes glare green. The pupils aresplit. He grins, showing big teeth.They are all changing. Among the things we see are:PETE SYLVESTER, who is a church deacon, rushing down theaisle, changing, snarling. He grabs ANDY FAIRTON and the twoof them grapple in the aisle.A YOUNG WOMAN with a baby in her arms turns back the blanketcovering the baby's face and we see it's a wolfling; alreadythe YOUNG WOMAN'S own hands are turning into claws.TAMMY STURMFULLER changing; PELTZER the druggist changing;the ZINNEMAN BROTHERS changing.At the organ, MRS. BOWIE is now a werewolf clad in tattersof a silk bombazine dress; she/it is still wearing a veiledhat on her head, and she is beating the shit out of theorgan keys with her clawed hands. She sounds like Jerry LeeLewis after swallowing about a dozen bennies. And now thetune changes from the remnants of "Bringing In The Sheaves."It changes into the Rheingold jingle. CONGREGATION (snarling chorus) My beer is Rheingold the dry beer... Think of Rheingold whenever you buy beer...INT. LOWEFATHER LOWE goes stumbling backward, dropping his hymnal.The man is in an extremity of terror. REV. LOWE No! No! No!INT.

LOWE, ON THE PODIUMHe's seen all he can stand. He whirls for the back, wherethere is a small door. He pulls it open... and a BRADYKINCAID werewolf, half torn apart but still somehow alive (azombie werewolf, if you can dig it- George Romero would likeit, I think) leaps out and seizes LOWE.BRADY buries his muzzle in LOWE'S NECK.INT. LESTER LOWE, ECUHe sits up into THE CAMERA and SCREAMS. Sweat is runningdown his face. He stares at us for a moment, his eyes buggyand crazed... and then he closes them.

HALLER One minute I had me some guts- as much as the next man, anyhow- and then, poof. Gone.PETE'S looking at him in a kind of terror. PETE Joe... you are going to feel better than this.

Hand me that box, Marty.MARTY hands him a medium-sized carton with the words "SpeedShop" printed on it. MARTY Yeah, okay, the fireworks. Jane thinks that's all I'm mad about, but it's not.

Only in her case I guess it would be Queen Shit of Turd Mountain. Hand me that adjustable.MARTY does. UNCLE AL slides the carb onto the gasket andstarts attaching bolts. UNCLE AL The guy killed your best friend, drove your girl out of town, and stole the second-best holiday in the year. Have I got it right? MARTY (glum) You got it right, Uncle Al.

He reachesin and brings out a handful of assorted fireworks- crackers,Roman candles, twizzers, smoke bombs, etc.An expression of sublime delight fills MARTY'S face as heinventories these goodies. UNCLE AL You're gonna have the Fourth of July in October, Marty. Just don't blow your head off. (Pause) And remember that it isn't just the fireworks. It's because no crazy shithead should be able to stop the good guys, if you can dig that. MARTY (respectfully) I can dig it- thank you, Uncle Al! Thank you! UNCLE AL Stay near the house, for Christ's sake- someone's killing people. I have to be out of my mind to be doing this, you know. MARTY Yeah, I know. It's great! UNCLE AL One of the reasons I love you, Marty, is that you're almost as crazy as I am. Please don't set off anything that goes bang tonight, okay? Just bright colors. Can you tell the difference? MARTY Yeah... sure. UNCLE AL Save this one for last.He brings out a short rocket with stubby vanes on the end. Afat fuse sticks out behind the head. MARTY What is it? UNCLE AL A tracer. You'll like it. MARTY Thanks a million, Uncle Al! UNCLE AL You're welcome a million, Marty. Stick 'em in the bushes for now.MARTY motors over to the side of the garage, where there's aline of bushes, and conceals the bag in them. UNCLE AL getsin his car and starts it up. MARTY comes back.

THE REAR OF THE COSLAW HOUSE NIGHTThere's a downspout outside one of the upstairs windows. Nowthe window goes up and MARTY leans out. He grasps thedownspout and begins working his way down. This should notbe too hard for us to believe; we've already seen how strongMARTY'S arms are.His legs dangle limply, but he's doing just fine. When hereaches the bottom of the drainpipe, they simply crumpleunder him and he uses his arms to pull himself over to theback porch.MARTY hoists himself over the porch rail. Here, under atarp, is the Silver Bullet. MARTY pushes the tarp aside andgets in. He uses his hands on the wheels to get over theporch ramp and rolls silently down it. At the bottom helooks up at:EXT.

THE PATH BETWEEN THE HOUSE AND THE GARAGEMARTY comes slowly up the path. We hear soft grunts ofexertion; he's still hand-turning the wheels for the sake ofsilence, and it's hard work. He stops at the line of bushesand gets the bag of fireworks. He puts it on his lap andstarts moving again.EXT. THE COSLAW DRIVEWAY, FROM THE ROADThe driveway has a slight downslant, and MARTY coasts easilyout to the road. He turns right and begins to roll slowlyalong the verge of the highway, still using his hands. Wecan see that the light is still on upstairs. MARTY turnsback once to verify this himself, then keeps on going. He'snot going to be deprived of his treat.EXT. MARTYHe decides he's far enough away to be safe. He pushes thestarter button. The engine cranks, coughs, and cranks somemore. MARTY frowns, and pulls out a wire- a rudimentarychoke, I suppose. He pushes the starter button again. Itcranks, but doesn't start.MARTY pushes in the wire, looking concerned now, and triesagain. This time, after the engine has cranked over a fewtimes, it starts. MARTY (softly) All right!He puts it in gear and starts off.EXT. THE ROAD, WITH MARTY, EXTREMELY LONGWhat we see is a tiny boy in a tiny wheelchair moving alonga dark, empty ribbon of road under a vast dome of stars.DISTANT SOUND: The Bullet's engine.EXT. A ROADSIDE TURNOUT NIGHTSOUND: Fast-rushing water.The turnout is packed dirt. There's a grove of trees withpicnic tables spotted among them at the back. The sign inthe extreme f.g. reads ROADSIDE REST AREA at the top; AUGERFALLS in the middle; TOWNSHIP OF TARKER'S MILLS at thebottom.SOUND: The Silver Bullet approaching.MARTY turns in and rolls to the back of the rest area. Hestops by one of the picnic tables and dumps the bag offireworks out onto the picnic table and takes his timeselecting the first- he's like a wine fancier with a wholecellar of rare bottles to choose from. At last he chooses atwizzer. He takes matches from the pocket of his pajama topand lights the fuse.When it starts to fizz, MARTY tosses it high into the air. MARTY (soft) Here's one for the good guys!EXT. THE TWIZZERIt flies in an arc over the drop.EXT. THE TWIZZER, FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE CUTTHE CAMERA TRACKS ITS FALL onto some rocks at the edge ofthe waterfall's catch pool.SOUND: Growling.EXT. THE CREEK, WITH THE WEREWOLFIt has been drinking from the creek. It looks more than halfhuman now- we would be able to recognize it for sure, butits face is in shadow.It turns from the creek and gets up on its hind legs.EXT. THE TWIZZER, ON THE ROCKSIt's guttering out. A hand-paw touches it and draws backquickly.SOUND: Hurt, angry growl.EXT. MARTY, IN THE REST AREAHe's getting ready to light one of the fountains. He pausesand looks toward the cut. He's heard something- but thewaterfall muffles it. He lights the fountain's fuse, sets iton the ground, and rolls the Bullet back a few feet.The fountain bursts into a shower of light. MARTY (delighted) All right!EXT. THE SLOPE OF THE CUT, MEDIUM LONGThe waterfall is in the b.g.The WEREWOLF is climbing the rocky slope.EXT. THE FOUNTAIN, CUIt goes out.EXT. MARTYHe rolls over to the picnic table and gets a Roman candle.He plants the stick in the ground and lights the fuse. TheRoman candle shoots into the sky.EXT. THE ROMAN CANDLEBursts into colored light.EXT. THE WEREWOLF, NEAR THE TOP OF THE CUT, MEDIUM LONGIt GROWLS... and shakes its fists at the fading light in thesky.EXT. MARTYHe's holding another fountain in one hand and his matches inthe other. He's looking toward the cut and the waterfall. MARTY Is someone there?EXT. THE WEREWOLF, NEAR THE TOP OF THE CUTIt freezes, GROWLING FAINTLY.EXT. MARTYWith a little shrug, he lights the fuse on the fountain andsets it on the ground, as before.EXT. THE BACK OF THE GROVE, AT THE TOP OF THE CUTClaw-hands settle over the top.EXT. THE FOUNTAIN, CUIt throws off fiery swirls of sparks, then begins to diedown.EXT. MARTYHe's checking out the stuff on the table for his next choicewhen he hears a clear SOUND: A SNAPPING, SPLINTERING BRANCH.EXT. THE GROVE, WITH THE WEREWOLFIt's run into a low-hanging branch. Instead of pushing itaside or ducking under it, it simply rips it off the tree.Although the branch is pretty big, the WEREWOLF does this aseasily as a hungry man might rip a drumstick off aThanksgiving turkey. It throws the branch aside andadvances, hunched over on two legs.EXT. MARTY MARTY (terrified) Who's there?EXT. THE GROVE AT THE BACK OF THE REST AREA, MARTY'S POVThe grove is a darkened shadowland.EXT. MARTYHe punches the Bullet's starter. The motor cranks andcranks. No go, though. MARTY pulls out the choke wire,alternating terrified stares at the grove of trees withterrified stares at his rudimentary dashboard.EXT. THE GROVE, MARTY'S POVHere it comes, out of the shadows, closing in.EXT. MARTYWorking that starter for all it's worth... but the motoronly cranks. Still no start.EXT. CLAWED, FURRY FEETEXT. MARTYHe gives up on the motor. He looks toward the picnic tablewhere the fireworks are. He grabs up the tracer. He gets thematches out of the breast pocket of his p.j.'s and promptlydrops them in his lap. He scrabbles for them.EXT. THE WEREWOLF, MARTY'S POVWe can't see its face in the dark, but it's closer... muchcloser.EXT. MARTYHe tries to hold the tracer and strike a match at the sametime.He can't; to do that he'd need at least one more hand. Heputs the tube of the tracer between his teeth and triesagain.EXT. THE MATCHBOOK AND MARTY'S HANDSHe strikes the match... too hard! It bends, the neck broken. MARTY (voice; moaning) Oh, please...EXT. WEREWOLF CLAWS, OPENING AND CLOSINGEXT. MARTYHe is in an extremity of terror.EXT. THE MATCHBOOK AND MARTY'S HANDS, CUHe pulls a fresh match from the book and strikes it. Itlights.EXT. THE WEREWOLFIt recoils- we still can't see its face except for a vagueshadow.(NOTE: I keep emphasizing the shadowed face, because this isnot a full-moon period. I've been going on the assumptionthat the guy kind of works his way up to full wolfiness,toothiness, hairiness, etc., starting with a partial changeat about the second quarter. It's a process like the tidecoming in. Thus, if we saw MARTY'S attacker clearly at thispoint, I think we would recognize him.)EXT. MARTY, IN THE SILVER BULLETHe takes the tracer from his mouth and applies the match tothe fuse. It splutters alight.EXT. MARTY AND THE WEREWOLF, A WIDER SHOTThe WEREWOLF is less than twenty feet away. The tracerflares alight and shoots out of MARTY'S hand, leaving apink-orange trail of smoke behind it. The missile flies atthe WEREWOLF's head.EXT. THE WEREWOLFThe tracer strikes it in the face, and we see a flash offire. The WEREWOLF screams and blunders away.EXT. MARTY, IN THE SILVER BULLETHe punches the starter again. The motor cranks.EXT. THE MOTOR OF THE SILVER BULLETThe motor coughs and fires; a big blue flame jumps from thefancy carb... and the engine starts to run.EXT. THE WEREWOLFIt's staggering away, ROARING and HOWLING. The tube of thetracer is sticking out of its face- from its left eye, infact- like an Indian's arrow. The WEREWOLF smashes branchesout of its way.EXT. MARTY IN THE SILVER BULLETHe wheels the Bullet around and heads for the road, gaspingand weeping with fear.EXT. THE WEREWOLF, IN THE GROVEIt's blundering through the trees. It pulls the tube fromits face with an ANIMAL SCREAM and drops it.EXT. THE TRACER, CUIt lies smoldering on the ground. The end is slick withblood.EXT. THE ROAD, WITH MARTYThe Bullet is really wheeling. MARTY is panting, out ofbreath, still deeply frightened.EXT. THE WOODS, WITH THE WEREWOLFWe see it blundering along, holding its face; blood bubblesthrough its fingers. WEREWOLF (snarling voice) Bastard Marty! Bastard Marty! Kill you! Reeeal slow!EXT. COSLAW DRIVEWAY, WITH MARTYHe powers up it, and along the path to the back. Perhaps hehas enough speed to cut the engine and coast.INT. MARTY'S BEDROOMHis bed is by the window. His hands appear on thewindowsill, and MARTY pulls himself in. He falls over ontohis bed and lies there, spent and exhausted and trembling.EXT.

MAIN STREET, MEDIUM LONG, WITH JANEJANE is pushing a supermarket shopping cart with a lot ofbeer and soda bottles in it. On the side is a sign readingMEDCU BOTTLE AND CAN DRIVE- plus an outline drawing of theMedcu unit. JANE (voice-over) He told me something that was clearly unbelievable... and yet, somehow I believed most of it.

LESTER LOWE is outfront, digging in his flower garden. He is shirtless, backto JANE and to us; his black shirt with the turned-aroundcollar hangs informally on a bush. JANE (calls) Hi, Father Lowe!

THE BARBER SHOP DAYAs JANE enters, BILLY McCLAREN is giving one man a trim.Another man is tipped back with his face wrapped in a towel.Two or three other townies are waiting on tonsorialbeautification, reading magazines. None, of course, has onlyone eye. JANE checks them all out carefully. BILLY I know what you're after, Jane, and you're out of luck. Little Toby Whittislaw was in yesterday, and I gave 'em all to him. JANE Oh... okay.But her eyes have fixed on the towel over the face of theman in the other barber chair. She walks over to him.INT. JANE AND THE TOWELED MAN, CLOSER ON JANE That you, Mr. Fairton?

JANE (quiet) You don't understand. UNCLE AL (wildly) Oh, I understand plenty! I understand that my niece and nephew are sending the local Catholic priest little love notes suggesting that he gargle with a broken light bulb or eat a rat-poison omelet! MARTY It came for me! I shot it in the eye! Now he's wearing an eye-patch! UNCLE AL I called Peltzer on my way over here, Marty! Father Lowe came into the drugstore two days ago for a bottle of otic solution. That's a fancy way of saying eyewash. He's got a corneal inflammation. MARTY Was it a prescription? UNCLE AL What the hell does that matter? MARTY It wasn't- I'll bet you it wasn't. Because to get a prescription he'd have to see a doctor. UNCLE AL Marty, Marty, you should hear yourself! MARTY Well... was it a prescription? UNCLE AL I don't know. But I know you didn't see any werewolf the other night, Marty. You had a dream, that's all. An extremely realistic nightmare brought on by what's been happening in this town. MARTY What about the baseball bat Jane saw in his shed? You know who used to have a baseball bat like that? Mr. Knopfler! He was so proud of it he used to carry it in the Fourth of July parade! Jane said it looked like the Green Giant used it for a toothpick! UNCLE AL You want to know what I think? MARTY No- we just got you out here so we could admire your pretty face. UNCLE AL Watch it, dear boy. I think it was a hallucination. Probably a broomstick, or something. JANE (indignant) It was not! You want me to show you! Come on! I'm not afraid! I'll show you right now! UNCLE AL No thank you, Jane. I'm a little old for palying the Hardy Boys Meet the Catholic Werewolf.JANE stamps her foot, furious with UNCLE AL. MARTY Never mind, Jane.

JANE If Father Lowe is an innocent little lamb, why hasn't he picked up the telephone and called Constable Haller to tell him Marty's sending poison-pen letters? UNCLE AL I don't accept the idea that he knows who his letter writer is, Jane. Because I don't accept the idea that there was a big bad wolf who saw Marty in his wheelchair.

MARTY I didn't shoot him when he was a man. I shot him when he was- UNCLE AL When he was a werewolf. Yes. Right. Jesus. Jane, you don't really believe this madness, do you? JANE I don't know exactly what I believe. But I know that what I saw was a baseball bat and not a broomstick. I know there was something strange about the way the house smelled that day. It smelled like an animal's den. And I believe in Marty. I mean- there are times when he makes me so mad I could kill him, but I still believe in him. (Pause) You used to believe in him, too, Uncle Al.UNCLE AL looks momentarily ashamed of himself. Then hethrows his hands up in disgust. UNCLE AL Kids!He walks ahead of them.

You see, our religion teaches that suicide is the greatest sin a man or a woman can commit. Stella Randolph was going to commit suicide; if she had done so, she would be burning in hell right now.

UNCLE AL Well... it's a lot easier to swallow without the hair and the foaming jaws. Also, I checked on the otic solution. It was counter brand. No prescription needed. MARTY I told you! UNCLE AL Shut up, dear boy- no gloating allowed. JANE (sits down) Did you talk to the constable? UNCLE AL After Marty called me with his latest Thrilling Tale of Wonder, I did. (Pause) He's had no poison-pen complaints lodged at all. MARTY I told you! JANE Shut up, Marty. UNCLE AL (reluctantly) There's something else. MARTY JANEWhat is it? What other thing? UNCLE AL I probably shouldn't tell you- you're both hysterical on the subject. I'm starting to feel like a guy handing out free Arthur Murray coupons to victims of the dancing sickness. MARTY Uncle Al, if you don't tell me-He makes strangling gestures. UNCLE AL (reluctant) I went out to that rest area. MARTY (triumph) You found the tracer? UNCLE AL No... but I found some blood, smeared on a tree trunk in that grove. MARTY There! You see! UNCLE AL It could have been anything, Marty.

HALLER That's just about the craziest damn story I've ever heard, Al. UNCLE AL I know. I could have edited out all of the completely crazy stuff, but I thought you deserved to hear it with the bark on. HALLER I appreciate that. Now, the next question: Do you believe any of this? You do, don't you? UNCLE AL Let's just say I believe Lester Lowe should be checked out.HALLER rises. HALLER That can be arranged.They shake hands.EXT. THE RECTORY NIGHTA Chevrolet with TARKER'S MILLS CONSTABLE painted on theside in gold leaf pulls up. JOE HALLER gets out, and as hedoes there's a business of pulling his pants legs down overhis boots- nice stitched cowboy boots, not black cop'sshoes. We want the audience to notice these boots, rememberthem- probably HALLER should wear them all through thepicture. He goes up the walk.HALLER rings the doorbell.No one comes.

THE REST AREA AT AUGER FALLS, WITH MARTY, AL, JANEDAYUNCLE AL has taken the Coslaw family station wagon today.The three of them are sitting in the grove of trees. MARTY Mr. Haller said he'd check him out, and guess what? No one sees him again! UNCLE AL And what do you suggest I do about it, dear boy?MARTY slips off his St. Christopher's medallion and hands itto UNCLE AL. MARTY I want you to turn this into a silver bullet. UNCLE AL You're not going to let it go, are you? MARTY I saw what I saw. UNCLE AL Marty, the moon wasn't even full! JANE (quietly) In the made-up stories, the guy who's the werewolf only changes when the moon is full. But maybe he's really that way almost all the time, only as the moon gets fuller... MARTY (finishes) ...the guy gets wolfier. JANE (hands AL her crucifix) Here. Take mine, too. MARTY Jane... you don't have to do that. JANE Don't tell me what I have to do and what I don't, booger-brains. MARTY Will you marry me, Jane? UNCLE AL Would you kids mind telling me how this guy Lowe became a werewolf to begin with? JANE I don't know. Maybe he doesn't know, either. MARTY No one knows how cancer begins, either- or exactly what it is- but people still believe in it. UNCLE AL The kid is eleven years old and already he sounds like a Jesuit. A French Jesuit. MARTY I think he's going to come for me. Not just because I know who he is, but because I hurt him. Only I don't think he'll try again as Lowe. UNCLE AL Dear boy, you have gone right out of your mind. MARTY Will you do it?UNCLE AL only looks at him, confused and unsure.EXT.

SILVER BULLET MONTAGEa.) UNCLE AL pulls up to a city store front with a signreading MAC'S GUNS AND AMMO. He takes out the St.Cristopher's medal, looks at it, and shakes his head, as ifstill ruing his own credulity and stupidity. He goes inside. JANE (voice-over) Uncle Al's friend Mac was more than a gunsmith; he was, Uncle Al said, an old-world craftsman, a sort of wizard of weapons.b.) In the gun shop interior, we see UNCLE AL talking toMAC, who really should look like an elderly white wizard- akind of Gandalf figure. In the b.g. window we see a paperskeleton and paper jack-o'-lanterns: our first clue that AllHallow's Eve is nearing. UNCLE AL is speaking animatedly,using his hands a lot; we don't know exactly what the taleis, but it must be a whopper. In the course of it, he handsthe medal and the crucifix to MAC, who tents the silverchains over his fingers and looks at them. JANE (v-o continues) God knows what sort of story my uncle told him, but I think that for men who have been married as often as Uncle Al, invention on short notice becomes something of a specialty.c.) In his workroom, we see MAC spilling boron over themedal and looking closely at the stain. JANE (v-o continues) The gunsmith confirmed the high-grade silver content of my crucifix and Marty's medallion...d.) In a dim shot which makes MAC look more like a sorcererthan ever, we see him light an acetylene torch and beginmelting the medal and the crucifix in the crucible. THECAMERA MOVES SLOWLY IN as JANE'S contribution and MARTY'Smelt together; they are becoming on and indissoluble. JANE (v-o continues) ...melted them down...e.)

THE BOX, CUMAC'S hands open it, disclosing a single bullet resting ondark velvet plush. It is a .22 short round, and it gleams apure silver. It would be great to hype this bulletoptically- not much, just a little- to make it lookabsolutely magical. Almost holy.INT. MAC AND UNCLE ALUNCLE AL picks up the bullet almost reverently, holds it tothe light. MAC Nicest piece of work I ever did, I think. It's got a low-grain load so it won't tumble. Should be pretty accurate. UNCLE AL It's just a gag, that's all. What would you shoot a silver .22 bullet at, anyway? MAC (joking) How about a werewolf? (Pause) Happy Halloween, Al.EXT. THE FULL MOON, CLOSE NIGHTIt nearly fills the screen, swimming mysteriously in thewarm summer air.

UNCLE AL We won't!The station wagon backs out into the road and NAN pops outagain. NAN You kids go to bed on time! You've got school tomorrow! UNCLE AL If you keep doing that, you're going to bump your head, sissy. Give my love to Mama- tell her I'll see her Thursday. NAN I will- be good, kids. MARTY JANE'Bye, mom! Bye, dad! We will! 'Bye!The station wagon accelerates away. UNCLE AL Can I tell you kids something? JANE Sure, Uncle Al. UNCLE AL When me and sissy were kids, we were just like you two. MARTY Yeah? Really?

Whatever it is, it's wonderful. And they'll be safe with him. I'm sure of it. BOB I know they'll be safe with him... but will he get them both into bed by nine-thirty?
