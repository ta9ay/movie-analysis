It's Snake Plisskenall right, live and in the flesh.  The guards leave.  Snake walks intoHauk's office and sits down in the chair across from Hauk.  He raiseshis cuffed hands to Hauk as if to say "Take these off me, asshole," buthe doesn't actually say anything.  Hauk shakes his head.HAUKI'm not a fool, Plissken.SNAKE(coooooool)Call me Snake.Hauk puts on his glasses and proceeds to read a file.HAUKS.D. Plissken.  American Lieutenant.  Special Forces Unit, Black Flight.Two Purple Hearts, Leningrad and Siberia.  Youngest man to be decoratedby the President.  You robbed the federal reserve depository.  Lifesentence, New York Maximum Security Penitentiary. I'm ready to kick yourass out of the world, War Hero.Snake could not care less.  He reaches forward with his still-cuffedright hand, picks up a cigarette, picks up a match with his left hand,strikes the match and takes a drag from his cigarette.

We heard of you, too, Plissken.SNAKEWhy are we talking?HAUKI have a deal for you.  You'll receive full pardon for every criminalact committed in the United States.Hauk shows Snake the pardon.  Snake's eye lights up.  This is somethinghe wants.  He's interested now, and can't hide it.HAUK(pressing his advantage)There was an accident about an hour ago.  A small jet went down insideNew York City.  The President was on board.SNAKE(re-establishing control over the conversation)President of what?HAUKThat's not funny, Plissken.  (beat)  You go in, find the President andbring him out in 24 hours, and you're a free man.We sense amusement from Snake.  This is not the first time thegovernment has asked him for a favor.  But he's not a soldier or a "WarHero" anymore.  He knows they need him more than he needs their pardon.He's holding the cards now, and he knows it.SNAKETwenty-four hours, huh?HAUKI'm making you an offer.SNAKEBullshit.HAUKStraight just like I said.SNAKEI'll think about it.HAUKNo time.

We need him alive.SNAKEI don't give a fuck about your war... or your president.HAUKIs that your answer?SNAKEI'm thinking about it.HAUKThink hard.Snake pauses to take a draw on his cigarette.  Next question:SNAKEWhy me?HAUKYou flew the Gullfire over Leningrad.  You know how to get in quiet.You're all I've got.SNAKEI guess I go in one way or the other.  Doesn't mean shit to me.  Give methe paper.HAUKWhen you come out.SNAKEBefore.HAUKI told you I wasn't a fool, Plissken.SNAKECall me Snake.INT. WEAPONS ROOM -- NIGHTRehme talks as we PAN ACROSS a table full of weapons.  We see two guns,a belt, grenades, several pouches full of various stuff, a flashlight, aUzi, throwing stars, and more.  Snake surveys them with a coolexpression.REHMESome of them have cars.  They took old junkers that were left behind andconverted them to steam.  We think they may also have a gasoline sourcein there, and power.  Greenhouses, rigged up generators.  Some areashave streetlights. The crazies.  Live in the subways.  Complete controlof the underground.  They're night raiders.Snake's not into this.  He'll figure it out when he gets there.  Hepicks up a bracelet with an eagle on it.HAUKTracer.  Sends a radio signal for fifteen minutes.  You push it, we cantrack you on radar.  Just like Leningrad.  But they added something.  Asafety catch.Snake pushes the safety catch.  Simple enough.  And yes, there's thebutton.  This is familiar.  He smiles.INT. HALL -- NIGHTSnake has his jacket slung over his shoulder now.  He walks down thehall to the medical room with Hauk.  Rehme has disappeared.SNAKEWhere am I landing?HAUKTop of the world trade center.  Only place you can land.  They won't seeit, and you can take off from a free fall.  On the roof there's aservice elevator.  It's still operational.  We use it to infiltrate theprison.  There's a power box.  It'll activate the elevator down tofifty.  From there on downyou walk.Snake shrugs on his jacket.  He knows Hauk is just trying to assert hisauthority, and it's not working very well.HAUKYou can locate the President by his vital signs bracelet, on his wrist.It sends out a sig pulse.

He's nervous.His hackles are up.SNAKEI don't like needles.Hauk straps a timer gauge onto Snake's left hand.  He activates it andthe time blinks on.  It's counting down as we speak.HAUKTwenty-two hours, twenty-nine minutes, fifty-seven seconds...SNAKEWe talked about twenty-four.HAUKIn twenty-two hours the Hartford Summit meeting will be over.  China andthe Soviet Union will go back home.  The president was on his way to thesummit when his plane went down.Snake snorts.HAUKHe has a briefcase attached to his wrist.  The tape recording inside hasto reach Hartford in 22 hours.SNAKEWhat's on it?HAUKYou know anything about nuclear fusion?Snake turns away.  No.  Nuclear fusion is not his area of expertise.HAUKIt's about the survival of the human race, Plissken.  Something youdon't give a shit about.Hauk steps aside.  The medic swabs Snake's neck on both sides.MEDICI'm going to inject you.  It'll sting for a second or two...He raises a couple of hypos and injects Snake with them.  Snake jumps alittle; clearly, this is not one of the world's most pleasant things.HAUKThat's it, Plissken.Snake gets off the table.  The medic turns around.MEDICTell him.SNAKETell me what?Hauk thinks he's got him this time.  Snake doesn't like that.HAUKThat idea you had about turning the Gullfire around 180 degrees andflying off to Canada.Hauk shakes his head.  Snake puts his jacket down and turns to themedic.SNAKEWhat did you do to me, asshole?HAUKMy idea, Plissken.  Something we've been fooling around with.  Twomicroscopic capsules lodged in your arteries.  They're already startingto dissolve.  In twenty-two hours, the cores will completely dissolve.Inside the cores are that heat-sensitive charge.  Not a large explosive.About the size of a pinhead.  Just big enough to --(he gestures)open up both your arteries.  I'd say you'd be dead in ten or fifteenseconds --Hauk stops talking because Snake has grabbed him by the throat.SNAKETAKE THEM OUT NOW.MEDICThey're protected by the cores.  Fifteen minutes before the last hour isup we can neutralize the charge with X-rays.Snake lets go of Hauk to look at his watch.  22:57:38.  37.  36.  Thisis his life he's watching tick away.HAUKWe'll burn out the charges IF you have the President.SNAKEWhat if I'm a little late?HAUKNo more Hartford Summit.
