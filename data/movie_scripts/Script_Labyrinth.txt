The sky is a glorious explosion of blue andmauve and lavender. The setting sun washes the clouds with a delicatepink tint. The bird swoops and spirals and we are right there withhim. Then suddenly, below us, an extraordinary sight appears.2	EXT: LABYRINTH - DAYIt is the labyrinth, an enormous maze of incredible mandala likeintricacy. From our magnificent vantage point, WE ARE BARELY ABLE TOMAKE OUT its details: the twisting walls interrupted here and thereby lush forest, the complex web of waterways, the forbidding castleat the core. It is vast and magical, frightening and compelling atthe same time. We would love to linger, perhaps fly lower and get abetter look at this wondrous place, but the bird flies on3	EXT: GLADE - DAYIt is an idyllic setting, warm and inviting. The late afternoon sunwashes everything with a pink glow. Between the water and a line oflush fruit trees is a flower-strewn glade. A FIGURE emerges from thetrees and walks toward the water. It is a YOUNG WOMAN dressed in aflowing white dress that swirls around her in the breeze. The pinklight burnishes her hair and causes a gold circlet she wears on herhead to glow. She is breathtaking, a vision of innocence and grace.She stops to pick a flower and then turns suddenly as if she hasheard something.GIRL: Is it you?She takes a few hurried steps and then stops, smiling shylyGIRL: Your Highness!The GIRL curtsies deeply and then looks up through lowered lashes,the shy smile still dancing on her lips. And then WE PULL BACK TOREVEAL a crown perched on a head of tight curls. WE ARE LOOKINGTHROUGH the crown at the girl as she rises slowly, then looks boldlyat the PRINCE.GIRL: Do not be swayed by my pleasure at the sight of you, my lord.For though my father, the Duke, has promised you my hand, I cannotconsent to be yours until the evil that stalks our land from highesthill to deepest dale is ...Suddenly the GIRL stops speaking, a look of stunned confusion on herface.GIRL: ... from highest hill to deepest dale ... (her brow furrows inconcentration and then) Damn!She burrows one hand into the deep sleeve of her gown and pulls out arolled-up soft-cover book. She rifles through the pages.The PRINCE is not a prince at all, but a SHEEPDOG wearing a tin foilcrown. He thinks his work is over and it's time to play and he lungeshappily towards the GIRL who isn't a princess or even a duchess, but15-year-old SARAH.SARAH is knocked over by the playful DOG. Beneath the gown which WECAN NOW SEE is homemade and not very grand at all, WE SEE faded jeansand running shoes.SARAH: Get off me, you monster!!The DOG grabs the book out of her hand and runs away with it, hopingto be chased. SARAH doesn't follow, she just sits up and pulls thegrass out of her tangled hair and sighs with frustration. The DOGcomes back over to SARAH, its tail wagging hopefully.SARAH: If you value your mangy life, Merlin, you'll hand it over.The DOG obediently drops the book.THE BOOKOn the cover it says, _MEANDER'S QUEEN a play in three acts by RobinZakar_. SARAH reaches for it and we hear a clock tower begin to chime.SARAH leaps to her feet.SARAH: Oh no, Merlin! We're really late! Why does everything have tohappen to me!!!?MERLIN prances around her happily, his foil crown in his mouth. SARAHpulls it out of his mouth and throws it in a nearby trash basket. Herushes after it and peers into the basket, wanting to fetch.SARAH: It's all your fault, you miserable mutt!!She hikes up her dress and runs into the trees. MERLIN whimpers andtags along behind her.4	EXT: THE OTHER SIDE OF THE TREES - DAYSARAH comes bursting through the trees and runs down a hill towardthe street. WE PULL BACK and WE CAN SEE an enormous steel mill on theother side of the river. And now WE NOTICE that the light isn't pinkany more but sort of dull and hazy, and the idyllic glade is barely asuburban park, and this is just an ordinary day in a very ordinaryplace.5	EXT: AN OLD RAMBLING HOUSE - DUSKSARAH runs up a path to an older, rambling house. She goes throughthe front door, MERLIN hot on her heels, and neither one of them seesthe beautiful SNOW-WHITE BIRD that lands in a tree beside the path.6	INT: INSIDE THE ROUSE - EVENINGSARAH bursts through the front door and makes a beeline for thestairs. She almost makes it. SARAH'S MOTHER appears in the hallway.MOTHER: _Sarah_, where have you been?!!!SARAH abruptly stops and changes to an elegantly graceful ascensionof the stairs.SARAH (in an affected voice): I can't talk to you now. I'm inrehearsal.She continues grandly on and heads for her room.MOTHER: You were supposed to be home an hour ago to baby-sit forFreddie! Don't we at least deserve an explanation?SARAH stops and leans over the railing. She speaks with amelodramatic solemnity.SARAH: As Meander's Queen, I've been ... meandering. Dither me notabout explanations.With that she turns and heads for her room. On the door is a signthat says: "Admittance by Invitation Only." SARAH'S FATHER comes intothe hall.FATHER: What's that all about?MOTHER: It's a part in a play, (raising her voice) but that's noreason to...SARAH turns in her doorway. She calls down.SARAH: Chasten not your Queen, _Peasant_!She dramatically sweeps into her room.7	INT: SARAH'S ROOM - NIGHTSARAH slams the door and leans against it, playing the scene.FATHER (VO): _Sarah_, that's no way to talk to your mother!SARAH (mumbles to herself): She's not my mother.SARAH takes a deep breath and closes her eyes. She can hear footstepsand SOMEONE comes to the other side of the door.SARAH ignores her STEPMOTHER and kicks off her running shoes.With a practiced gesture SARAH removes her jeans while leaving hergown in place.STEPMOTHER (VO): _Sarah_, when I tell you to be home at five, Iexpect you to be home at five.SARAH quickly shifts to her STEPMOTHER's attitude -- hands on hips,and silently mimes her words.SARAH: Yes, Madame!7A	INT: UPSTAIRS HALLWAYSTEPMOTHER: And don't "Yes Madame" me!FATHER: Is she all right?STEPMOTHER (frustrated): Of course she's all right! I left theBernsteins' number on the kitchen table ... Freddie might be comingdown with a cold so call us if he seems even the least bituncomfortable ...SARAH (VO) (sighs): Yes, Mother.STEPMOTHER: Oh! I give up!She hurries down the stairs.FATHER: We'll see you later, baby. And remember ...7B	INT: SARAH'S ROOM - NIGHTSARAH speaks along with him, mimicking.SARAH & FATHER (VO): Don't open the door to strangers.We hear him leave. SARAH waits a beat and then turns and opens herbedroom door.SARAH: And don't call me baby! (she slams the door shut; mimickingher parents) Precious little Freddie might be coming down with a cold...She sighs and looks around. This is really her world, her retreat,and she knows and controls every inch of it. The shelves are filledwith an orderly array of childhood dolls and toys. The books arelined up neatly in the bookcase and if we could see them up close wewould see that they were placed in alphabetical order -- andaccording to the year they were acquired. She walks over to herdresser. She checks herself out in the mirror above the chest ofdrawers and adjusts the golden circlet which has been knocked askewby her run. She then stops for a moment and looks at the photographson the dresser. One of her FATHER, her MOTHER and herself as a LITTLEGIRL. Another picture of her MOTHER in a newspaper clipping is tapedto the mirror. The headline says, "Linda Williams a Smash in NewPlay." A cover of a Playbill is also tacked on to the mirror. It says_Best of Both Worlds_ starring Linda Williams. SARAH then reverentlyopens a music box -- the kind with a twirling dancer inside -- and tothe strains of an unbearably tinny version of "Greensleeves" shebegins to rehearse.SARAH: Do not be swayed by my pleasure at the sight of you, my Lord...Suddenly, something stops her cold.SARAH (yelling angrily): Someone has been in my room!Through the mirror WE SEE what she sees: an empty space on one of theshelves. She swirls around and rushes out the door.8	INT: THE HALLWAY - NIGHTSARAH bursts out of her room.SARAH: Where's Lancelot?She stomps down the hallway.SARAH: Where's my bear?!!9	INT: NURSERY - NIGHTSARAH enters FREDDIE's room. She searches the nursery.SARAH: Nobody listens to a thing I say.She opens a toy box and rifles through it.SARAH: How many times have I told them to stay out of my room ...She gets to the crib and looks down. FREDDIE is wide awake, gurglingat Lancelot, SARAH's tattered old teddy bear.SARAH: And you, you can just give me back my bear!She yanks it out of the crib and leaves. FREDDIE looks hurt and hisface starts to cloud up.10	INT: SARAH 'S ROOM - NIGHTSARAH is curled up on her bed, cuddling her bear. MERLIN sits besideher. She looks at the DOG.SARAH: You're the only one who understands me, Merlin.He licks her face. She gets up and holds the bear out in front of her.SARAH: Do not be swayed by my pleasure at the sight of you, my lord...She is interrupted by FREDDIE's cries.SARAH: Go to sleep, Freddie!The cries get louder. SARAH sighs and repeats her favorite litany.SARAH: Why does everything have to happen to me?11	INT: NURSERY - NIGHTSARAH enters and approaches the howling INFANT.SARAH: I don't need this.She pulls the blanket up over him and attempts to tuck him in.SARAH: There, isn't that nice ...But FREDDIE doesn't think so. He pushes the blanket off and howlseven louder. SARAH sees one of his toys on the floor and picks it upand gives it to him. She speaks through gritted teeth.SARAH: Want your nice toy?But FREDDIE doesn't. He flings the toy across the room. SARAH bendsover the crib and speaks softly.SARAH: You know, Freddie, I heard that the only thing to do with ababy who won't stop crying is to get some goblins to come over andteach him a lesson ...FREDDIE lowers his screams to a whimper, but a loud whimper.SARAH: How would you like that, kid? A nasty evil goblin ...FREDDIE is quiet for a moment, almost as if he is considering. Thenhe really howls. SARAH sighs and picks him up. She begins to paceback and forth, and starts to hum. FREDDIE goes back to a merewhimper.SARAH: Oh, you like that, do you?She begins to hum even louder and more melodically as she places theBABY back into the crib. She then begins one of the moat macabrelullabies you could ever imagine. She sings of how scary the dark is,how "the shadows on the wall like to eat you when you're small" andhow "a baby doesn't stand a chance when the Goblins start theirdance." She throws herself into her performance; adding to it a wilddance that has her whirling around the room, leaping into the air,making strange shadows on the wall. Finally, the dance ends when toomany crazed pirouettes result in her stumbling against FREDDIE'sdresser. She staggers a bit and then the lights blink as a crack ofthunder is heard, followed by a flash of lightning.ANOTHER ANGLELittle FREDDIE is wailing. He hasn't understood a thing that SARAHhas sung but he can sense that something is wrong.SARAH: Ah, c'mon, Freddie. It was just a song.They are interrupted by the sound of the doorbell. SARAH reacts witha gasp of surprise. FREDDIE, for some inexplicable reason, issuddenly quiet.12	INT: FOYER - NIGHTSARAH approaches the front door with some trepidation. She starts toopen it, then realizes what she is doing. She fastens the chain andonly then opens the door.13	EXT: HOUSE - NIGHTSARAH'S POVThrough the door opening SARAH can see a very elegantly dressed,quite good-looking MAN of an indeterminate age. He has a worldly air,or is it other-worldly? Before he can speak a flash of lightningilluminates his face. He is a mesmerizing sight and SARAH can't helpbut gawk.MAN: Excuse me, is this the home of Sarah Williams ... SarahWilliams, the actress?SARAH's jaw drops.SARAH: That's me.MAN: Allow me to introduce myself ... (he holds out his hand) I'mRobin Zaker.SARAH squeals with delight.SARAH: You wrote the play!He smiles.SARAH: Just a second.14	INT: FOYER - NIGHTSARAH's hand hesitates over the chain for just a moment, and then sheunfastens it and opens the door. ZAKAR enters and extends his hand.ZAKAR: It is an honour, Miss Williams. I understand you make adelightful Queen Meander.SARAH: Well, we've just started rehearsal, but how did you know?ZAKAR: I was passing through this part of the country and heard thatit was going to be done here. This is the first amateur production ofthe play, which of course is delightful for me.SARAH: You know we were supposed to open tonight, but we got delayed.The firemen had to use the hall.ZAKAR: Yes, I know, that's why I wanted to stop by to see you.They are interrupted by a particularly loud crash from upstairs. Andthen FREDDIE begins to howl.SARAH: That's my brother ...There is another crash and SARAH starts up the stairs.SARAH: I'll be right back!ZAKAR watches her run up the stairs. He glances around and then walksright to the liquor cabinet and takes out a bottle.15	INT: NURSERY - NIGHTFREDDIE in standing in his crib crying his eyes out. SARAH rushes inand sees that the storm has blown open the basement window and it iscrashing against the wall. She rushes to close it. FREDDIE's screamsare piteous.SARAH: Oh, Freddie ...There is more thunder, and then lightning flashes across the darkenedroom.ZAKAR (VO): Perhaps I can soothe him ...SARAH gasps and whirls around. ZAKAR is framed in the doorway. He hasa drink in his hand. SARAH holds the BABY close.SARAH: You shouldn't be up here!ZAKAR (smoothly): I just wanted to help ...SARAH rushes by him, still clutching the BABY.16	INT: HALLWAY - NIGHTSARAH comes out of the nursery and hurries down the stairs. ZAKARfollows. FREDDIE is still crying.SARAH: Maybe you'd better leave ...She gets to the bottom of the stairs. FREDDIE whimpers. ZAKAR ismaking her very nervous.SARAH: ... I, uh, don't think I care to talk to you about the play.He is right behind her, almost too close.ZAKAR: Neither do I.SARAH is shocked and disturbed by this.SARAH: What!ZAKAR reaches over and smoothes FREDDIE's hair.ZAKAR: I'm more concerned about the baby, of course.SARAH pulls FREDDIE out of his reach.SARAH: Freddie's just fine.But he isn't. He's still crying. ZAKAR reaches into his pocket andpulls out a coin. Be runs it over his fingers right in front ofFREDDIE's face. The BABY stops crying.ZAKAR: There, isn't that better?SARAH (nervously): Uh, sure ... but you really have to leave ...ZAKAR ignores her and heads into the living room.ZAKAR: I'm not just a playwright, as you can see ... bring him inhere and I'll do some other tricks for him ...SARAH: No! You've got to ...But he is already in the living room. She follows, still holding theBABY.17	INT: LIVING ROOM - NIGHTZAKAR is sitting on the sofa, looking very comfortable. SARAH standsin the doorway, not sure what to do. Reluctantly, she goes and sitsdown across from him.ZAKAR: Now watch this, Freddie ...He reaches into his breast pocket and tugs on the handkerchief there.It comes out followed by many others, all different colours. SARAHrolls her eyes. This is not that exciting a trick. FREDDIE isn'timpressed, either. In fact he starts to cry again.ZAKAR: So you're going to be like that, are you, Freddie? Well, youknow what that means?He leans across the table and SARAH pulls the BABY closer.ZAKAR: It's time to call the goblins!SARAH: What?!!SARAH is surprised to hear this, to say the least. It echoes hersilly threat to FREDDIE earlier.ZAKAR: Yes. That's what we do with bad babies ... we send for thegoblins!!And with that he reaches into yet another pocket and pulls out apoorly made, very silly-looking goblin hand puppet. SARAH laughswith relief. ZAKAR, his hand in the puppet, talks in a high-pitched,unconvincing goblin voice.ZAKAR: You like goblins, don't'cha, Freddie? (singsong) but I betyour sister doesn't ...SARAH rolls her eyes at this, and then gasps. Because for one verystrange moment, the puppet keeps bouncing, but both of ZAKAR's handsare visible! And then the puppet seems to move away from the table,and disappear! FREDDIE claps his hands with delight. SARAH jumps outof her chair.SARAH: Where is it?!!!ZAKAR points to a large cabinet against the wall.ZAKAR: It's in there.SARAH: Impossible!ZAKAR: See for yourself.SARAH hesitates for a moment, and then places FREDDIE carefully onthe rug. She then marches over to the cabinet and throws open thedoor.ANOTHER ANGLEthe puppet, grinning wildly from inside the cabinet.ANOTHER ANGLESARAH gasps and involuntarily slams the door. She whirls around toface ZAKAR.SARAH: How did you do that?!!ZAKAR leans back into the sofa.ZAKAR: Magic.SARAH: Oh sure ...She nods, skeptically. She can't see -- but WE CAN DEFINITELY SEE --the cabinet door slowly open behind her, and out of it comes a tiny,fierce-looking GOBLIN! This is not a puppet, but a living creaturethat moves quickly out of sight with an exaggerated tiptoe. SARAH isbusy with another problem. She doesn't see FREDDIE!SARAH: Where's Freddie?!!ZAKAR shrugs. In a panic, SARAH begins to look around this room. Shecalls for FREDDIE and, as she passes in front of the living roomdoorway, WE CAN SEE something scurry across the hallway. SARAH stopsand listens.SARAH: Freddie?But it wasn't a BABY she heard. Behind her there is more scurrying asCREATURES begin to appear from various parts of the room. We hearfaint snickering. She turns to ZAKAR, terrified.SARAH: Where is he?!!ZAKAR points to the chair SARAH was sitting in. She is behind thechair and can't see anything. But when she comes around in front ofit she sees FREDDIE comfortably ensconced in the cushions. And he'splaying with the goblin puppet! SARAH reaches over and grabs thepuppet out of his hands. She flings it across the room and scoops upthe BABY.SARAH: Who are you?!!!ZAKAR throws back his head and laughs, then suddenly leaps off thesofa and lands very close to her.ZAKAR: I've been known by many names ... but the one I prefer is_Jareth, King of the Goblins_!!!SARAH holds FREDDIE close and backs away.SARAH: I don't believe this!Amidst thunder and lightning JARETH flings his arms up into the air,and he is suddenly dressed in strange, medieval garb, a cloakswirling around him. And what's worse, much, much worse, is thatsuddenly GOBLINS are everywhere! Popping out of drawers, from underchairs, swinging off the chandeliers. SARAH turns and runs out of theroom.18	INT: FOYER - NIGHTIt's worse in here! The GOBLINS are pouring down the stairs, SOMEslide down the bannister! SARAH tries running into another room, butis soon back, followed by a DOZEN MORE! She barely makes it to thefront door and struggles to open it with the BABY in her arms. TheGOBLINS pull her back and laugh wildly. They fling her right intoJARETH's arms. He scoops FREDDIE up and whirls away from her. SARAHtries to grab the BABY back but the GOBLINS get between them.SARAH (hysterical): Give him back, you monster! Give him back!JARETH only laughs and starts to swirl gracefully. FREDDIE laughswith delight and SARAH struggles to reach him. With a superhumaneffort she pushes through the MASS OF CREATURES and grabs ontoJARETH's fluttering cloak. It's like being caught up in a whirlwindof incredible force.SARAH (screaming): I ... won't ... let ... you ... take ... him!But it's too late. SARAH's feet leave the ground and she is pulledwith them and the whole MASS OF GOBLINS. JARETH and FREDDIE swirl upthrough where the ceiling would have been, up into the blackness.There's a QUICK MONTAGE OF SHOTS: JARETH's laughing face; SARAH,desperate as her fingers are losing their grip; FREDDIE, who's havinga great time; GOBLINS, ALL gleeful; then -- JARETH's garment pullsout of SARAH's grip. She falls OUT OF FRAME, a silent scream on herface.19	EXT: LABYRINTH - DAYA WIDE PEACEFUL SHOTThe sky is pink, and the WHITE BIRD swoops by us as WE TILT DOWN TOSEE the exterior wall of the labyrinth. It is a high masonry wallthat extends off in either direction. Along the wall are variousornamental bushes and there is a small figure of a dwarf, his back tous, peeing into a tiny pond. It looks for all the world like one ofthose ornamental garden sculptures. But it isn't. This is HOGGLE. Ina CLOSER SHOT, which is quite discreet, HOGGLE finishes peeing, andgoes over to a particularly lush shrub. A few butterfly-likecreatures, flower fairies, flit around the bushes.HOGGLE: An' how's me pride an' joy!He leans forward to sniff one of the magnificent blossoms, sighingwith pleasure as he does. But before he can indulge he is stopped bythe whistling sound of a falling object. SARAH falls from the sky andlands right on his prize shrub! Incensed, he screams with fury.HOGGLE: What is this? Look what you done! You murderer!SARAH struggles out of the broken shrub.SARAH: What are you saying, you horrible little man?!HOGGLE: I ain't horrible, I'm _Hoggle_. And just look! You'vedestroyed me prize blossoms!He realizes the extent of the damage to his prize specimen.HOGGLE: I'll get ya for it, you big oaf!And he picks up a spray can and goes after SARAH. But she's hadenough. After the nightmarish kidnapping of FREDDIE and a drop fromthe deepest space, this guy is child's play. She reaches out andpulls the can from HOGGLE's hands. She then grabs him by theshirt-front and practically lifts him off the ground.SARAH: Oh no you don't! If anyone's getting anything around here,it's me ... now where' my brother?!!HOGGLE: I ain't sayin' nothin' 'til ye let me go!SARAH sighs and lets go.SARAH: I'm sorry. But this just hasn't been my day.HOGGLE looks at his crushed shrub again.HOGGLE: Ye ain't the only one.SARAH ignores him and stares at the massive wall behind them.SARAH: And I don't understand any of this!HOGGLE shakes his head and sighs.HOGGLE: Now where have I heard that before.SARAH: What do you mean?HOGGLE: I mean, everyone who comes here thinkin' they can make itthrough the labyrinth says sumthin' like (mimicking Sarah in a whiny,high pitch) ... I don't understand this, whatever am I doing here,how will I ever get home ...SARAH: What makes you think I'm here to get through a labyrinth?HOGGLE shakes his head again.HOGGLE: Can't think of any reason why you'd be standin' here in fronto' this gate if you weren't.SARAH doesn't understand what he is talking about but when she looksup she can't believe her eyes.ANOTHER ANGLEA huge gate where just a moment ago there nothing but smooth, endlesswall. SARAH gulps in disbelief. Then the huge wooden doors fly openand a terrified CREATURE runs out, full speed, screaming for hislife. Right behind him come TWO MENACING GOBLINS riding on strangeBEASTS. They are armed and dangerous looking. They quickly catch upwith the CREATURE and drag him, screaming piteously, back through thegate. Before the gates close SARAH can see MORE GOBLINS, what seemslike hundreds of them. SOME are mounted, MOST of them are armed. Andbeyond them a walled passageway seems to go on forever. Then thewooden doors slam shut.SARAH: Oh, no! Not more goblins!HOGGLE: That's Jareth's goblin army, and that other poor fool mustabeen caught meanderin' where he had no business.SARAH: What will they do to him?HOGGLE: I don't like to think about things like that.SARAH shudders.SARAH: I wonder if things can get any worse?HOGGLE sighs knowingly.HOGGLE: He's taken sumthin' o' yours, ain't he?SARAH is clearly surprised.HOGGLE: Jareth, our high an' mighty king ...SARAH nods, excited that someone has a grasp of the situation.HOGGLE: Bet he's gone and taken sumthin' you love.SARAH (shrugging): Close. He's got my baby brother.HOGGLE laughs derisively.HOGGLE: Baby snatchin'! That's low.SARAH: So I've just got to do something!HOGGLE: Like what?SARAH: Get Freddie back, of course!HOGGLE: Then ya'd have ta make it through the labyrinth, 'causeJareth's castle is at its very center.SARAH looks at the gates and gulps.SARAH: Is it difficult?HOGGLE snorts with derision.HOGGLE: Is me prize shrub crushed into oblivion?SARAH is reaching the breaking point.SARAH: Look, I'm sorry about your bush! But it's not like I asked tohave some weirdo come and take my baby brother and then drop me outof the sky!HOGGLE: Well, I didn't ask for some overgrown flower fairy to drop onme prized possession, neither!SARAH: Oh, this is ridiculous!And she stalks off to the gate, mumbling all the way.SARAH (to herself): ... standing here wasting time talking to someweird guy who should be living under a bridge ...She is almost at the gate when she freezes with fear. Through thegate she can hear the cheers and jeers of the GOBLINS, and what mightbe the wailing of their poor CAPTIVE. There's no way she wants torisk facing that horrific CREW. HOGGLE has come up behind her and asshe backs away from the gate she bumps into him. She shrieks andwhirls around.HOGGLE: That ain't the only way in, ya know!SARAH is very relieved to hear this.SARAH: It's not?!HOGGLE: Course it ain't. There's many a route in ... just only oneway out.SARAH: Well show me one! I've got to find my brother!HOGGLE sighs impatiently. Be fingers a belt that he wears, rattlingit in an obvious manner. It in hung with every kind of watch andbracelet and ring you can imagine.HOGGLE: Information like that has a price ...SARAH, taken aback by the amount of loot he's acquired.SARAH: I could give you this ...She takes the gold circlet off her head. HOGGLE isn't interested.HOGGLE: I had sumthin' o' this caliber in mind ...He takes her hand and WE SEE that she is wearing a beautiful rubyring. SARAH shakes her head vehemently.SARAH: No. My mother gave me that.HOGGLE eyes it greedily.HOGGLE: She could give ya another ...SARAH: No, she couldn't. (sadness crosses her face suddenly) Shelives real far away ...The sadness disappears just as suddenly. She holds out the circlet.SARAH: This is all you get.He grabs the circlet and bites it.HOGGLE: Bah! It's paste!Something catches SARAH's eye. It is one of the tiny FLOWER FAIRIES.She leans over for a better look.SARAH: No it's not, it's plastic.HOGGLE's eyes light up at that and he grunts with satisfaction as hestrings the circlet onto his belt. SARAH reaches out her hand to theFAIRY.SARAH: What a beautiful little thing ...HOGGLE reaches for the spray can.HOGGLE: Let me at it!SARAH is enraged.SARAH: You murderer! How can you kill such beautiful creatures?!!Just then the FAIRY gives SARAH a vicious bite. She shakes it off herhand and cries out in pain.SARAH: It bit me!HOGGLE quickly sprays the offending FAIRY and it falls to the earth,screaming all the way.HOGGLE: Of course it bit ya! There's nuthin' more vicious than aflower fairy. Any fool knows that!SARAH sucks on her wounded hand and tries not to cry.HOGGLE (sighs): But you don't know nuthin', do ya?A tear trickles down SARAH's cheek. HOGGLE sighs.HOGGLE: I got a feelin' I'm gonna regret this. (he stalks off) Comewith me an' I'll show ya a way in.SARAH hurries after him. As they walk along the endless wall HOGGLElooks at the circlet and polishes it on his sleeve.HOGGLE (thrilled): Plastic!20	EXT: LABYRINTH - DAYAnother part of the wall. HOGGLE pushes a bush aside and shows SARAHa tiny door. She looks at it dubiously.HOGGLE: This'll take ya into the maze, that's the first part of thelabyrinth ...SARAH: The first part! What comes after that?HOGGLE gets down on his knees and starts to crawl through the door.HOGGLE: Then there's the Garden Maze, then the Forbidden Forest ...SARAH: That sounds inviting ...He is through the door. He is still talking but SARAH can't hear him.She quickly tries to follow.SARAH: Wait! Wait! I can't hear you ...21	INT: LABYRINTH - DAYHOGGLE is through the door.HOGGLE: ... then comes the castle ...SARAH's head appears.HOGGLE: ... that's surely where Jareth's keepin' the babe ...He looks down at SARAH, she is through the door to her waist andstraining to get the rest of herself through. HOGGLE sighs and grabsher hand. With a groan he tugs on her and pulls her through thedoorway. She lands flat on her face.HOGGLE: Ya don't seem ta be able ta do nuthin' without my help, do ya?He chuckles and SARAH gives him a look that could kill as she gets upand dusts herself off. She looks around and the environment seemsrather benign. The brick walls are open to the sky, here and there aflower peeks through a crack.SARAH: Oh, I think I can handle it. In fact, this place doesn't seemso bad at all.And with that, she jauntily heads down the nearest corridor.22	INT: CORRIDOR 1 - DAYSARAH turns a corner and comes face to face with a FACE. It is hugeand grotesque and protrudes out of the wall.FACE: Go back! Go back before it's too late!SARAH screams and backs away from it, moving further down thecorridor. She backs into something and whirls around. It is ANOTHERFACE.FACE 2: Turn back while you still can!!SARAH turns and runs back the way she came.SARAH: Hoggle!23	INT: LABYRINTH - DAYHOGGLE is still standing by the door, an amused smile on his face.SARAH comes rushing toward him.SARAH: Oh, I'm so glad you're still here! They were horrible ...HOGGLE: You don't mean the False Alarms, do ya?He shakes his head and goes off in the direction that SARAH just camefrom.HOGGLE: If ya gonna let a little thing like them scare ya, Missy, yahaven't a hope o' makin' it to the castle.SARAH quickly follows.SARAH: False Alarms?24	INT: CORRIDOR 1 - DAYThe corridor of faces. HOGGLE enters and the FACES start in on theirroutine. SARAH comes up behind him, shuddering at the ghastly sight.FACE 1: This is the path of no return!FACE 2: Beware! Beware!HOGGLE: Just ignore 'em.SARAH: Are you sure?HOGGLE sighs and turns to the NEXT FACE.FACE 3: Abandon all hope ...HOGGLE: Oh, shut up, will ya?SARAH is wide-eyed at HOGGLE's defiance.FACE 3: But I was just getting to the best part!HOGGLE: All right. But don't expect us to pay any attention.FACE 3 (winks at Sarah): You're going to love this ... Abandon allhope ye who enter here, for this is the road to destruction!!!HOGGLE (bored): Very nice ...SARAH is dumbstruck. HOGGLE takes her hand and yanks her along.FACE 3: Come back any time ... I mean, you're doomed, doomed!25	INT: CORRIDOR 2 - DAYHOGGLE and SARAH continuing down a similar corridor.HOGGLE: Ya see, things aren't always what they appear to be aroundhere, Missy ...SARAH (shrugging): Whatever. All I'm interested in is getting mybrother back from that creep.She starts to look around for something.HOGGLE: I admire yer determination, but it takes more'n that to beatJareth.SARAH picks up a rock.SARAH: Well, maybe I'm beginning to get the hang of this labyrinthbusiness.She takes the rock and uses it to mark an X on the floor.SARAH: See, now I'll know which way we came in case I get lost.HOGGLE (sighs): Missy, goin' back the way ya came is par fer thecourse around here, what ya want to do is go forward.SARAH: Look, Hoggle! I've got to find Freddie and I don't need you todiscourage me!HOGGLE: And I don't need to be wastin' me time goin' around incircles with you!SARAH: That's fine with me! (she starts off) I know you're only aftermy ring, anyway!She turns a corner and HOGGLE looks after her, hurt and pity crossinghis face. He takes a few steps in her direction and an officiouslittle creature, a BRICKKEEPER, emerges from the brickwork of thefloor, takes out the cobblestone that SARAH marked, and replaces itwith the marked side hidden. It looks up at HOGGLE.BRICKKEEPER: Some people got no respect for property!HOGGLE sticks his tongue out at the CREATURE just as it goes backinto its hole.26	EXT: AERIAL SHOT - DAYThe WHITE BIRD flies over the maze and WE SEE SARAH marching along.She thinks she's going forward but she's heading right for HOGGLE.27	INT: CORRIDOR 2 - DAYSARAH emerges into the corridor and comes face to face with HOGGLE.SARAH: But ...She whirls around to look behind her, then back at HOGGLE again.SARAH: ... but you were just behind me! I'm sure of it!HOGGLE shakes his head as she runs by him and looks down at the floor.SARAH: My mark! It was right here!HOGGLE comes up beside her.HOGGLE: I told ya, Missy. Things aren't what they appear to be aroundhere ...JARETH (VO): Except when they are.ANOTHER ANGLEJARETH, in all his glory. SARAH and HOGGLE whirl around and BOTH gaspwith surprise and fear.JARETH: We meet again ... Sarah.SARAH: Where's Freddie?!! What have you done with him!?She starts to rush toward JARETH but HOGGLE holds her back.JARETH: Nothing ... yet.He walks toward them and they automatically step backwards. He looksdown at HOGGLE.JARETH: And what have we here ... Hoghead, isn't it?HOGGLE is humiliated.HOGGLE: Me name's Hoggle.JARETH: Ah, yes. Now I remember. (he moves closer to Hoggle) You'rethe greedy little coward who lives outside the gate. Shouldn't you beback there minding your own business ... Hedgehog?He chucks HOGGLE under the chin, and is quite rough about it. HOGGLEfumes silently. SARAH doesn't like this.SARAH: Why, why don't you pick on someone your own size?He looks her up and down.JARETH: Whom did you have in mind?SARAH tries to brazen it out.SARAH: I don't have time for any games. I want Freddie, and I wanthim now!JARETH throws back his head and laughs.JARETH: Ah, Freddie. An adorable little imp. I'm really growingrather fond of him.SARAH: Where is he?!!JARETH: He's in my castle, and seems to be enjoying himself immensely.He ambles toward them and they can't help themselves, they BOTH stepbackwards.JARETH: In fact, he likes being with goblins so much, I'm consideringturning him into one.SARAH thinks this is crazy.SARAH: You can't do that!JARETH (grinning): Oh yes I can.SARAH looks down at HOGGLE and speaks under her breath.SARAH: Can he?HOGGLE nods glumly.JARETH: But let's make it interesting. I won't do it for ... thirteenhours. If you make it to the castle before then you might be able tosave him. If not, well, I think little Freddie will mike an adorablegoblin prince, don't you?He laughs and holds up both hands and WE SEE that they are empty. Hethen closes them and when he opens them again there is a gold watchin one hand. He throws it to SARAH, but HOGGLE intercepts it and eyesit greedily. Annoyed, SARAH snatches it out of his hand. She looks atit and sees that it has 13 hours marked on it. When she looks upagain, JARETH is gone.WORM (VO): Well, good riddance to bad rubbish!SARAH and HOGGLE BOTH jump and then look at where the voice is comingfrom. It is a little WORM, poking its head out of a hole in thebrickwork.WORM: That's what the missus always says, she does. Why the last timeshe found that one around here she sent him packing.SARAH: Jareth?!WORM: She don't take to his kind of nonsense, that's for sure. Now,how about a nice cup of tea? The missus has a kettle on.SARAH looks down at HOGGLE, who shrugs. She then looks up at the WORMand gives him a beaming smile.28	INT: CORRIDOR 2 - DAYSARAH and HOGGLE are sitting on the floor.SARAH: Do you think Jareth will give Freddie back if I make it ontime?HOGGLE: It's hard to say, Missy. But if I were you, I'd worry 'boutfirst things first.SARAH: What do you mean?HOGGLE: I means ya got ta find the castle before ya can go savin' thebabe and I mean ta see that ya do!SARAH is thrilled and leans over and gives him a kiss on the cheek.SARAH: Oh, Hoggle! Thank you, thank you so much!HOGGLE gets all flustered and tries to act gruff.HOGGLE: Seems to me I could be gettin' that ring from ya after all ifI plays me cards right.SARAH regards him affectionately.SARAH: I know you don't mean that. You're helping me because you'rereally nice.HOGGLE: I ain't nice! I just likes the way ya stood up ta him is all.(he is thoughtful for a moment; almost to himself) Too bad more've ushaven't had the guts to do the same.The WORM reappears.WORM: How about a biscuit? The missus just took a fresh batch out ofthe oven.SARAH: Thanks, but we really don't have any time. We've got to get tothe castle.HOGGLE: Ya wouldn't happen to know a shortcut, would ya?WORM: Well, you might try taking that first left.SARAH and HOGGLE look down the corridor.SARAH: But there isn't any left turn.Just then a strange FIGURE seems to come through the left wall andwalks toward them. He is dressed in long flowing robes and wears ahat shaped like a bird.WORM: See, there's a left turn right there, where that Wise One justcame in.SARAH: A Wise One! Maybe he knows the best way to the castle!HOGGLE: I wouldn't bet on it.But SARAH is excited about the possibility of getting more help.SARAH: Excuse me, Sir. Could you tell us the best way to get to thecastle?WISE ONE: The best way to the castle, hmmm. I'm glad you asked thatquestion.To SARAH's and HOGGLE's surprise, the HAT joins into the conversation.HAT: Now you've done it, gone and asked him a question. We'll be hereall day!WISE ONE: A castle, or fortress, or as it is sometimes known, astronghold or citadel -- or, that which has a turret and barbican,but usually not a portcullis ...HAT: What did I tell you? There's no stopping him now.WISE ONE: ... often there is a rampart or bulwark, and then a parapet-- perchance an actual vallum or counterscarp ...HAT: Shut up down there!WISE ONE: ... and for entrenchment; a moat, drawbridge and sally-port...SARAH looks at HOGGLE.SARAH: This was not one of my better ideas.HAT: Well, I told you that, didn't I? But nobody ever listens to me!He looks down at the still mumbling WISE ONE.HAT: Enough! Nobody cares!!The WISE ONE blinks and looks at SARAH and HOGGLE.WISE ONE: Did one of you say something?SARAH thinks quickly.SARAH: Oh, no. We never talk to strangers.WISE ONE: That's very wise. An idea worth savoring.HOGGLE nudges him.HOGGLE: Yeah, but keep it under your hat!HOGGLE thinks this is hilarious. The HAT doesn't.HAT: Ve-ry funny!The WISE ONE continues on his way.WISE ONE: The stranger, hmm. I'm glad you brought that up. Thestranger; one not indigenous, also known as the alien, or one frombeyond the sea ...HAT (hysterical): I quit! I can't take it anymore!And then they are gone, passing through the righthand wall as if itwasn't there. SARAH watches after them, stunned.SARAH: How did he do that?!!HOGGLE: And how can we make sure he doesn't come back?SARAH gives him a look and turns to the WORM.WORM: Just go over to that bit of wall there and walk right throughit. The important thing is to forget what you think you know. Itdoesn't apply around here.SARAH and HOGGLE walk down to the part of the wall where the WISE ONEentered. Once there, they can see that a section of the wall isactually a passageway-width behind the rest of the wall. SARAH yellsback to the WORM.SARAH: Thank you! And tell the missus we're sorry we missed herbiscuits!And then they walk through the wall and are gone.29	INT: CORRIDOR 3 - DAYSARAH and HOGGLE appear through the wall and SARAH laughs withdelight. HOGGLE wasn't as pleased with the experience and feels thewall as if testing to see if it really happened. SARAH sees that theyare in a corridor where the walls are crumbling and she climbs up tothe top of one and looks over.ANOTHER ANGLESARAH'S POV - THE TURRETS OF THE CASTLESARAH (excited): I can see the castle! It doesn't look far at all!HOGGLE is still feeling around the wall, trying to figure out howthey got there. SARAH jumps down and starts to run down the corridor.SARAH: Come on, Hoggle. Let's go!HOGGLE sees her retreating figure and hurries after her.30	INT: CASTLE - DAYJARETH's great hall. He stands by a window and looks out over thelabyrinth -- from this vantage point he can see clear across it: thehovels that surround the castle walls, the arid plain that leads tothe dense forest, encircling that, the complex maze. He seems lost inthought. The WHITE BIRD enters the window and lands on his shoulder.Behind him FREDDIE is having a grand time. His slippery crawl is toomuch for the GOBLINS that scurry about, trying to mind him.Meanwhile, a particularly stupid looking GOBLIN begins to approachJARETH. He saunters across the room and is stopped short by a FEMALEGOBLIN. She grabs hold of his shirt and hisses a warning.FEMALE GOBLIN: Remember! It's bow and scrape ... bow and scrape ...The STUPID GOBLIN nods and she lets him go. He then continues hisapproach to JARETH, only this time he does a little bow and thenscrapes his foot across the floor, then repeats the action.STUPID GOBLIN (to himself): Bow 'n scrape ... bow 'n scrape ...JARETH turns and sees the GOBLIN.JARETH: Well, what is it?The GOBLIN can't answer and do his bow-and-scrape at the same time socontinues his painfully slow approach.STUPID GOBLIN: ... bow 'n scrape ... bow 'n scrape ...Annoyed, JARETH walks over to the GOBLIN and lifts him up by hisshirt front. The GOBLIN is still bowing.JARETH: I said, what is it?!!!STUPID GOBLIN: Th ... the girl and Hoggle, sire. Th ... they'rehalfway th .... through th ... the maze.JARETH drops the GOBLIN hard on the floor. FREDDIE sees this andlaughs with delight. JARETH walks over and scoops the BABY up in hisarms. He then carries him over to the window. He calls over to anARMED GOBLIN by the door.JARETH: I think it's time they had some company.ARMED GOBLIN: Yes, Sir!Be then salutes, causing his visor to close on his face, thenstumbles around looking for the door. JARETH shakes his head.JARETH: You'll make a much better goblin than that, won't you,Freddie!FREDDIE's response is to clap his sticky baby's hand on to JARETH'sface. JARETH, pretending he doesn't mind, carefully removes it. Hethen looks down to the courtyard below.31	EXT: CASTLE - DAYJARETH'S POVARMED GOBLINS are pouring out of the castle.32	EXT: CORRIDOR 4 - DAYSARAH and HOGGLE are striding down a corridor. They are about to cometo a corner.SARAH: Are you sure Jareth can turn Freddie into a goblin? I mean,that's really weird ...They turn the corner and HOGGLE stops short. SARAH becomes alarmed.SARAH: What is it?HOGGLE gestures for her to be quiet and then we can hear what hehears -- marching. They look back the way they came.ANOTHER ANGLESARAH'S AND HOGGLE'S POV - A BATTALION OF ARMED GOBLINS, marchingright towards them!ANOTHER ANGLEThey look at each other, then turn and run. HOGGLE tries to getthrough the wall the way the WORM showed them.HOGGLE (quoting the worm): Just forget what you think you know and ...He smacks headlong into the wall. He stops to rub his nose and SARAHflies by him.SARAH: Come on!33	INT: CASTLE - DAYFREDDIE is now sitting on the lap of a GOBLIN, happily bopping it onthe nose. JARETH snaps his fingers and a GROUP of sleepy MUSICIANS inthe corner stumble over themselves to pick up their instruments. Theybegin to play and JARETH looks out the window and begins a song. Hesings about the labyrinth; what it is -- his domain, and what it isto OTHERS -- a test, a proving-ground, not for the faint of heart.34	INT: MAZE MONTAGE - DAYWhile JARETH sings, SARAH and HOGGLE try to escape from the GOBLINS.They get a lead on them for a while and come to another corridor withcrumbling walls. They scamper up to get a look at their position andsee dust rising from several parts of the maze. The GOBLINS areeverywhere.In another corridor, they are stopped in their tracks by DOZENS OFLITTLE FUZZY CREATURES who scurry towards them out of the way of theoncoming GOBLINS. They turn and run back the way they came and asthey do WALL CREATURES chatter nervously and then disappear into thecracks between the bricks.In a corridor with very short walls they are able to see the tips ofspears on either side of them, going in the opposite direction.They enter a corridor with several arches curving over it, formingsmall, intermittent bridges. Thinking they are safe, they stop for abreath, and soon realize that a BATTALION is right behind them. Theyscurry up the walls, and as the song comes to an end, they each lieacross an arch hopefully out of sight of the GOBLINS below.35	INT: ARCHED CORRIDOR - DAYSARAH and HOGGLE huddle above the corridor on their arches as TWOGOBLINS bring up the rear.GOBLIN 1: I can kill better than you can.GOBLIN 2: But I'm better at maiming. Everybody says so.And they are gone. Shaken, SARAH and HOGGLE slide down from theirhiding places.SARAH: Do you think they're gone?HOGGLE: Sure they are. Goblins ain't known fer their intelligence, yaknow. They has as much trouble findin' their way through the maze asyou do.He folds his arms and leans against the wall.SARAH: I'm not sure, but I think you just called me stupid ...Suddenly HOGGLE yells and disappears. He has accidentally leaned onanother secret wall opening. SARAH quickly follows.36	INT: CORRIDOR 5 - DAYHOGGLE and SARAH are now in the long circular corridor that dividesthe maze from the beginning of the second ring of the labyrinth --the Garden Maze.HOGGLE (excited): I think I know where we are!SARAH: That'll be a nice change.He ignores her and looks around excitedly.HOGGLE: This place is the end o' the maze! That means we're near theentrance ta the second ring o' the labyrinth.SARAH: The second ring? What's that?HOGGLE starts down the corridor.HOGGLE (happily): The Garden Maze!SARAH (gloomy): Sounds like a great place ... what's it like?HOGGLE: Don't know, I ain't never made it this far before.He is skipping happily down the corridor when SARAH hears something.It is a strange clanking sound.SARAH (frightened): Hoggle! What's that sound?!!HOGGLE stops skipping and sighs.HOGGLE: Now don't go gettin' all girly on me, Missy, now that we'sfinally safe ...SARAH: So you think we're safe, do you?HOGGLE (annoyed): Didn't I just say so?!!SARAH: Then tell me what you think of that.SARAH points behind them where the clanking noise is coming from. Itis now much louder. HOGGLE comes over to her and takes a better look.He screams.ANOTHER ANGLETHEIR POV - A SLASHING MACHINE is coming right towards them. (Aslashing wall is made up of rows of furiously spinning knives, andchopping cleavers, and has brushes along the bottom to clean upwhatever it encounters in its path.) And there is no way around itbecause it completely fills the corridor.ANOTHER ANGLEHOGGLE desperately tries to walk through the wall the way they camein, but it is to no avail. He just keeps smashing his face. SARAHstarts to run for it.SARAH: Come on!HOGGLE follows, every so often trying, and failing, to get throughthe wall.ANOTHER ANGLESARAH, who is far ahead of HOGGLE, comes to a door! And hanging on ahook next to it is a bunch of keys. She looks back at HOGGLE.SARAH: Hoggle, hurry!ANOTHER ANGLESARAH'S POV - HOGGLE running toward her, and making slow but steadyprogress toward them BOTH -- the slashing machine.ANOTHER ANGLESARAH fumbles with the keys, furiously trying key after key in thedoor but to no avail. She is terrified.SARAH: None of the keys work!Desperate, she starts banging on the door. HOGGLE is just a few yardsaway from her.HOGGLE: Why don't you just try it?He then tries once more to walk through the wall. SARAH tries theknob and sure enough, it opens. She is delighted. What she doesn'tsee is HOGGLE suddenly disappearing through the floor.SARAH: It's open! Hog ...She turns around and he is gone! And the slashing machine is just afew yards away! She screams and, in her terror, falls backwardsthrough the door. It slams shut just as the slashing machine reachesit WE CAN SEE that FOUR GOBLINS in sanitation workers' uniforms havebeen pushing the machine all along. They grunt and strain, crankingthe wheels that turn the knives and pushing all at the same time.37	INT: PICTURE GALLERY - DAYSARAH emerges into a large room. The walls are covered with largepaintings in ornate gilt frames. She is a bit stunned by the clonecall with the slashing machine as she approaches the first painting.SARAH (to herself): What in the world ...She stops short in front of the first painting and cannot believe hereyes. It is a painting of the watch with 13 hours on it. The hourhand is on the 9. SARAH fumbles into her pocket and finds the watchthat Jareth gave her. It also has the hour hand on the 9.SARAH: Only 9 hours left!The next picture is of a BABY surrounded by gruesome GOBLINS. Oncloser inspection, the BABY is obviously FREDDIE. She chokes back asob and runs over to the next one, it is a picture of a rotunda withstaircases going off in all different directions on different planesof gravity. It is an Escher room, and a closer look shows a GOBLINhappily standing on the ceiling. She shakes her head and goes by thenext painting and gasps involuntarily. It is a compelling portrait ofJARETH, and she moves even closer. Then she shakes herself out of it.ANOTHER ANGLETHE PORTRAIT'S POV - SARAH wills herself away and moves on, and wehear the sound of JARETH's breathing.ANOTHER ANGLESARAH is nervous and eagerly looks for a way out. She rushes byanother painting, giving it merely a glance. But something makes hergo back for a better look. It is of a lovely, manicured hedge maze.In the distance WE CAN SEE the turrets of JARETH's castle. And in thesky nearby flies a beautiful WHITE BIRD. And then SARAH is amazed bywhat she sees. A closer look at the painting reveals that the WHITEBIRD is flying! It moves over the hedges and WE SEE a FIGURE waving.SARAH: Hoggle!SARAH, disturbed, backs away from the painting. And then, because itreally is as wonderful as it is scary, she goes back for another lookand over her shoulder WE CAN SEE HOGGLE waving and we hear his tinyvoice.HOGGLE: Missy! Over here! This is the way to the castle!And SARAH strains to hear, and leans toward the painting, stretchingher hand out and touching the painting, which makes it turn into ashimmering wall that her hand goes right through. And then shedisappears right through the painting.ANOTHER ANGLETHE GALLERY. And JARETH's portrait is now blank.38	EXT: HEDGE MAZE - DAYSARAH rushes up to HOGGLE and throws her arms around him.SARAH: What happened to you? I was afraid I'd never see you again!HOGGLE: Ya know that trick with the wall? Damn, if it don't work withthe floor, as well!SARAH laughs and hugs him again.39	INT : HEDGE MAZE - DAYSARAH and HOGGLE have been walking through the maze a long time. Theyare tired and bedraggled. SARAH pulls the watch out of her pocket andsighs.SARAH: An hour's gone by and I don't think we're more than four feetfrom where we started.HOGGLE: That's 'cause ya won't do what I tells ya. It's clear as daywe should be goin' this way ...He turns a corner and walks smack into a hedge dead end. He howls inpain and SARAH sighs and follows him.ANOTHER ANGLEHOGGLE disentangling himself from the hedge.SARAH: Got any more suggestions?Before HOGGLE can answer they are interrupted by a terriblegut-wrenching scream. It is positively unearthly. SARAH whirls around.SARAH: It sounds like it came from over there!HOGGLE points in the opposite direction.HOGGLE: Then let's go this way.SARAH frowns at him as the scream begins again.SARAH: Hoggle! It sounds like someone's being hurt!HOGGLE: Exactly why we should be headin' in the othermost direction!SARAH shakes her head in disgust and runs off as the screams becomemore unbearable.ANOTHER ANGLESARAH, running through the hedge maze. Driven by the sound of thescreams, she has an unconscious ability to find her way through.HOGGLE, trying to keep up with her, keeps running into dead ends.ANOTHER ANGLESARAH emerging from the maze. She is stopped in her tracks by whatshe sees and quickly covers her mouth to prevent herself fromscreaming. HOGGLE emerges a moment later, barely pauses before heheads right back into the maze.40	EXT: CLEARING - DAYSARAH'S POV - FOUR GOBLINS are torturing a huge creature (LUDO) thatthey have hung by his ankle from a tree limb. They have also takenpains to bind the CREATURE, who it is obvious could take an most ofthem and win in a fairer fight. He is about nine feet tall,powerfully built, and his screams of frustrated agony are trulyunbearable. The GOBLINS have devised a unique method of harassinghim. They ALL carry long sticks which have small, fierce, bitingCREATURES on the end of them. The GOBLINS bat their sticks at LUDO,who bellows and tries to swat back. Since he is tied, the NIPPERS arefree to bite him whenever they get near.ANOTHER ANGLESARAH, distraught, peeking out from behind a hedge.SARAH: The poor thing!HOGGLE peeks out from behind SARAH, then quickly ducks back. SARAHlooks for a way to stop the torture. She picks up a rock andcarefully aims it at the nearest GOBLIN. It hits his head and knockshis helmet visor over his eyes. Blinded, the GOBLIN lurches around,swinging his nipper stick at the OTHER THREE.BLINDED GOBLIN: Hey! Who turned out the lights?The OTHER GOBLINS see a new target and poke their nipper stickstowards him. He takes off and runs blindly into the hedge maze. TheOTHER THREE chase him, carrying the nipper sticks upright no that WECAN SEE their progress in the BG.ANOTHER ANGLESARAH desperately tries to untie the huge knot that holds LUDOsuspended upside down. She can't undo it and yells for HOGGLESARAH: Get out here, you coward!HOGGLE appears from behind his hedge. He hesitates, then pulls adagger from his belt and joins SARAH. He cuts through the rope in onehack, and LUDO falls to the ground with a thud.ANOTHER ANGLEThe nipper sticks start yammering away as they see SARAH and HOGGLEfreeing LUDO over the top of the hedge. The GOBLIN chase stops andthey head back to the clearing. HOGGLE dives for the bushes but adetermined SARAH stays and pulls off the ropes. When LUDO is free, hepicks up a huge log. As the FOUR GOBLINS come roaring back into theclearing, LUDO waves the log over his head. The GOBLIN chargeimmediately shifts into a GOBLIN retreat, the nipper sticks yippingin fear.ANOTHER ANGLELUDO puts down the log and sits, his big shaggy head hanging down. Hetaken one hand and wipes away a tear.LUDO: Ludo ... hurt.SARAH's heart breaks. This thing is the ultimate stuffed animal.SARAH: Is that your name? Ludo?He nods and wipes away another tear.LUDO: Goblins ... mean to Ludo.SARAH: Oh, I know! They were terribly mean to you. (she moves closerand pats his arm) But it's all right now.LUDO sniffs and then breaks into the most endearing big dumb smileyou have ever seen.LUDO: Friend!SARAH: That's right, Ludo! I'm your friend. I'm Sarah.LUDO: Sarah ... friend!HOGGLE has come out from hiding during this exchange. He finds thewhole scene a bit nauseating. And an unnecessary nuisance. If there'sone thing he doesn't want, it's competition for SARAH.HOGGLE: I think I'm about ta be sick.They ignore him and LUDO grins for all he's worth as SARAH beams upat him. HOGGLE pulls her over to one side.HOGGLE: I hope yer not thinkin' o' lettin' the beast traipse along,Missy. He'll just slow us up.SARAH: Are you kidding?! He'll be a great help! The goblins arescared of him because he's so fierce ...Just then LUDO shyly offers SARAH a flower that he has just pickedfor her. She takes it and smiles at him.HOGGLE (sarcastically): I sees what ya mean.SARAH shrugs and gives LUDO a pat. HOGGLE sighs with frustration.HOGGLE: I just thinks we was doin' fine on our own.SARAH: And we can do even better with Ludo. (turns to Ludo) You wantto help me save my baby brother, don't you, Ludo?LUDO: Save ... baby. Good!SARAH nods with satisfaction and strides into the hedge maze. LUDOright behind her. HOGGLE follows, clearly unhappy.41	EXT: FOREST GATE - DAYSARAH, HOGGLE and LUDO come out of the hedge maze and see a wall withtwo SARAH-sized doors in it.HOGGLE: This is it, the entrance ta the Forbidden Forest. All wegotta do is pick a door ...SARAH: What difference does it make? Let's just go!LUDO quickly steps between SARAH and the doors.LUDO: One door ... good. One door ... bad.HOGGLE: Well, that's great news. (to Ludo) Don't suppose ya knowwhich is which?SARAH skirts around LUDO and goes up to the doors for a closer lookat them.LUDO: One door ... good. One door ...HOGGLE: All right, ya walkin' mountain! Ya made ya point.ANOTHER ANGLESARAH ignores the bickering behind her and examines the doors. Eachone has a door knocker on it. Both knockers are carved into faces,except one has the ring going through its ears and the other has itstuck in its mouth.SARAH (to herself): I guess once you choose a door ... all you haveto do is knock.The KNOCKER with the ring through its ears speaks.KNOCKER 1: Are you addressing me?SARAH jumps back, stunned.SARAH: You can talk!KNOCKER 1: What? What? You'll have to speak up!!KNOCKER 2: mmffn ... grnth ... sminvl ...SARAH turns to the OTHER KNOCKER.SARAH: You too!KNOCKER 2: ... gmft ... bmble ...SARAH shakes her head in amazement.ANOTHER ANGLEThe BOYS are still at it.HOGGLE: If yer so smart why not show us another way inta the forest?LUDO: Ludo ... not ... know.HOGGLE: That figures, don't it? (he turns his back on Ludo, fuming)Why the Missy wants an overgrown hill o' hair fer a friend is beyondme.LUDO tries to make HOGGLE feel better and pats him on the shoulder.HOGGLE shakes his hand off with a growl.ANOTHER ANGLESARAH is excited.SARAH: I love it! Talking doors!! (to Knocker 1) Are you the rightdoor to the forest?KNOCKER 1: It doesn't do to ask me. For some reason I can't hear athing.SARAH turns to KNOCKER 1.KNOCKER 1: No use asking him, either. All he does is mumble.KNOCKER 2 gets very excited.KNOCKER 2: thgt ... vrnf ... lcl ...SARAH: I get it! You can't talk with that ring in your mouth!She removes the ring and looks at the FACE triumphantly.SARAH: Now, tell me which one of you is the right door to the forest.KNOCKER 2: Oh, I am. No question about it.SARAH: Great! How do we get you to open up?KNOCKER 2: One merely has to knock.SARAH: Of course, why didn't I think of that.She tries to get the ring back in its mouth.KNOCKER 2: Oh no you don't, young lady! I've had just about enough ofthat awful thing, thank you very much!SARAH: But how are we supposed to get through this door if you won'tlet me knock on it?KNOCKER 2: Well, I really couldn't say now, could I?SARAH throws up her hands in disgust.KNOCKER 1: Oh do speak up, both of you? I can't hear a thing!ANOTHER ANGLEHOGGLE and LUDO are still at it.HOGGLE (conspiratorially): Ya know ... even if she does get the dooropen, ya won't be able ta fit through. Why not make it easy on us alland take a hike?LUDO: Ludo ... Stay!HOGGLE is disgusted.HOGGLE: Yer quite the speechifier, ain't ya?ANOTHER ANGLESARAH suddenly gives KNOCKER 2 an evil grin.SARAH: Are you sure there isn't anything I can do to change your mind?KNOCKER 2: Absolutely not! My lips are sealed!SARAH: That's what I thought!The KNOCKER presses its lips firmly together. SARAH deftly squeezesits nose shut. It sputters for air and finally has to open its mouthbefore it suffocates. SARAH shoves the ring in with a gleeful cry oftriumph. She knocks, and the door swings open.SARAH: Let's go!She goes through the door and HOGGLE and LUDO race to follow. TheyBOTH try to get through the door at the same time and get into such atangle that the door closes before they can straighten themselves out.HOGGLE: Now you've done it!In a frenzy, HOGGLE starts banging on both doors.HOGGLE: Missy! Missy, wait!42	EXT: FORBIDDEN FOREST - DAYSARAH on the other side of the door. Except on this side, there is nodoor, just a long expanse of wall. The forest is very dark, and asits name suggests, very forbidding. SARAH can hear HOGGLE calling,but it is very faint.SARAH (scared): Hoggle?43	EXT: FOREST GATE - DAYHOGGLE is beating on the doors with such a frenzy that the other doorswings open.HOGGLE: I'm coming ...He rushes through the door and disappears. We can tell from his voicethat he is falling down a deep hole.HOGGLE (echoed): ... Miiiiiiiiissy!We hear a huge splash. Then that door shuts and LUDO is all alone.LUDO: Sarah ... gone. Hoggle ... gone.He is sad and confused. A FIGURE emerges from the hedge maze andbegins to walk along the wall, away from LUDO. It is the WISE ONE.LUDO brightens and chases after them.LUDO: Wait!The WISE ONE stops and the HAT looks LUDO up and down.HAT: This ought to be a good one!LUDO: Ludo ... need ... door!WISE ONE: You have need of a door, do you? Ah, yes. A very usefulthing, the door; also known as a portal or threshold -- and thatwhich gives access, a gate or gangway ...He continues walking and LUDO walks with him, listening intently.WISE ONE: ... also an entrance or entry, often accompanied by apropylaeum ...HAT (sighs): If only I had hands I could cover my ears ... that is,if I had ears ...WISE ONE: ... not to be confused with a window, or fenestration ...44	EXT: FOREST - DAYSARAH has waited long enough.SARAH: Hoggle, Ludo ... where are you?She reaches into her pocket and looks at the watch. The hour hand ison the 7.SARAH: (whispers) Oh, Freddie! (she shoves the watch back into herpocket) Well, you guys are going to have to catch up with me 'cause Ican't wait.Then determined, she strides off.45.	INT: HOLE - DAYHOGGLE is in a pool at the bottom of a deep hole in the ground. Thereis a ledge just above him and he splashes violently trying to reach it.HOGGLE: Somebody help me! I can't swim!46	EXT: FOREST - DAYSARAH is in a very thick, creepy part of the woods. She is clearlylost. She gets herself tangled in a thorn bush, and struggles with itto get herself free. Finally she does, and then, frustrated, sitsdown on the ground.SARAH: Why does everything have to happen to me?But there's no time to think about that because she hears the soundof a driving drum rhythm and then a wild-looking, spindly, leeringLITTLE CREATURE comes scampering through the trees and into theclearing; and then ANOTHER, and ANOTHER and ANOTHER. SARAH isterrified as they approach her, but then not so terrified because theCREATURES aren't doing anything except dancing; wild, loose-limbed,frenzied dancing. SARAH laughs, and can't help but be taken in by thewild spectacle. And then they begin to encircle her, still moving tothe wild rhythm.SARAH (laughing, moving): What are you?WILD THING 1: We're Wild Things, baby! Wild!WILD THING 2: Wild and free!WILD THING 3: Get down!And then more WILD THINGS appear, and these produce instruments. Asand turn the drum rhythm into a frenzied upbeat number.WILD THING 1: You call that wild! I'll show you wild!And then he does an amazing thing, to say the least. He takes hishead off and rolls it along his arms from hand to hand like ajuggler, then tosses it high in the air and deftly catches it on hisshoulders. SARAH gasps and tries to get sway but another WILD THINGpushes her back into the middle of the melee.WILD THING 2: Cut me some slack and move on back!And they do, and, moving to the pounding rhythm, he takes his eyesout of his head and waves them at SARAH. He then tosses them on theground as if they were a pair of dice. They land at SARAH's feetlooking straight up.WILD THING 2: Snake eyes!SARAH is fascinated and repelled. And the beat gets hotter and thefrenzy more frenzied and she can't help getting a little wildherself. She begins to really dance.WILD THING 3: That's it, baby, get wild and free! But you'll never beas wild as me!And to prove it he takes his head off and begins to dribble it like abasketball. WILD THING 1 leans over to SARAH and whispersconspiratorily.WILD THING 1: I wouldn't call that really _wild_, would you?SARAH: Well, it's ... uh ... sort of ...WILD THING 1: I'd call _this_ wild ...And he takes off his head, puts it on the ground as if it were a golfball, and then removes a leg and uses it as a golf club. The headgoes flying, right to SARAH. SARAH catches the head, then tries toget it back to its body but the body dances into the middle of allthe other WILD THINGS and she can't find it. So there's SARAH,running around like a chicken with two heads when suddenly the earsstart to flap and the head flies out of her hand. A WILD THING grabsher hand and turns her around.WILD THING 2: That was _wild_, baby. (he starts to dance) Now how'bout gettin' wild with me?But SARAH has had enough.SARAH: I think I'll sit this one out ...WILD THING 1: Not with us you don't ...WILD THING 2: 'Cause we're _wild_!And then they're all over her, like a bunch of hyper puppies, andit's really too much.SARAH: Enough! I've got to find the castle!WILD THING 2: Well, why didn't you say so, baby!WILD THING 3: That's a _wild_ idea!And then his head flies off and he has to quickly grab it and put itback and meanwhile the OTHERS start pushing and pulling on SARAH andpropel her into the woods.WILD THING 1: They got some wild goings on at the castle, baby!47	INT: HOLE - DAYHOGGLE is holding on to the ledge with his fingertips. He doesn'thave the strength to hold on much longer and he looks down at thewater in mortal terror. He begins to slip just as a door opens in thesheer rock and JARETH enters, accompanied by GOBLINS.JARETH: Well, what have we here ... if it isn't little _Piggle_!HOGGLE screams and slips into the water. He tries to struggle back tothe ledge but the GOBLINS push at him with poles, laughing maniacally.JARETH: Did the girl decide she doesn't need you, now that she hasthat beast?HOGGLE (angry): She wouldn't do nuthin' like that!JARETH leans over the water, laughing.JARETH: Don't you know she could never care for a repulsive thinglike you!HOGGLE splashes and tries to stay afloat.HOGGLE: She does care! Me 'n Sarah is friends!JARETH: Only until something better comes along ... and I'vedefinitely got something better in mind!HOGGLE: Don't you hurt her!HOGGLE grabs on to the ledge and the gleeful GOBLINS push him backdown into the water.JARETH: What I do to her is my business ... and it is _inevitable_.He grabs HOGGLE by the shirt front and lifts him out of the water.JARETH: You can be with me or against me.HOGGLE (terrified): Wh ... what do I gotta do?JARETH: I doubt if she can make it to the castle in time ...He leans down and speaks directly into HOGGLE's face.JARETH: But just in case, I want you to deliver her to me.HOGGLE: Never! I'd rather die!JARETH sneers scornfully.JARETH: Then so you shall.He drops HOGGLE back into the water. The GOBLINS shriek with delight.HOGGLE goes under and comes up sputtering.HOGGLE: Wait!JARETH was about to leave. He turns back to HOGGLE, a look ofamusement on his face.HOGGLE: I gotta know what ... what you'll do to her!He splashes pathetically in a desperate attempt to stay above water.JARETH: I will do what ever amuses me ...He reaches into his cloak and brings out a perfect peach.JARETH: All _you_ have to do is give her this.He tosses HOGGLE the peach. HOGGLE catches it and immediately thewater starts to recede.JARETH: You've made a very wise decision.He leaves, followed by the GOBLINS.HOGGLE: I didn't decide nuthin'!HOGGLE stares forlornly at the peach, and soon the water is gone andhe is sitting on cold, damp ground.48	EXT: FOREST - DAYThe WILD THINGS are leading SARAH on a rocky path. She stumbles alongbut they couldn't care less.SARAH: Are you sure this is the way to the castle?WILD THING 1: Oh, did you say "the castle"?WILD THING 2: I thought she said hassle!WILD THING 3: I thought she said rassle!WILD THING 1: Rassle! That's a _wild_ idea!He leaps on SARAH and she flings him off.SARAH: OK, guys, fun's over.She starts to leave and they pull her back.WILD THING 2: Over! It's just begun!And then the musicians are back and the dancing gets wilder thanever. The WILD THINGS totally surround SARAH, and though they aren'thurting her, they are definitely not letting her out. What they do isstart throwing their heads at each other and switching them.WILD THINGS 1, 2 & 3: Now this is _really_ wild!ANOTHER ANGLEA door opens in a nearby boulder and LUDO appears. In the backgroundWE CAN SEE and hear the WISE ONE as he wanders off.WISE ONE: ... very often preceded by a porch, or portico, alsoverandah, and followed by a vestibule, otherwise known as anantechamber or foyer ...HAT: Why me?!!The door closes. LUDO sees SARAH in the middle of this weirdness andis just a bit confused. SARAH sees him amidst the flying heads andcries out in relief.SARAH: Ludo!LUDO: Sarah ... not ... want ... castle?SARAH: Are you kidding?!! Get me out of here!!!LUDO approaches the WILD THINGS and grabs a head before it reachesits target and calmly tosses it into the trees.WILD THING 3: Hey, big fella! That's a little _too_ wild ...But there's no time to talk because LUDO calmly catches the otherheads and tosses them away. The bodies go scurrying after theirheads, followed by the MUSICIANS. SARAH is free.SARAH: Oh, Ludo! I'm so glad you're here!She gives him a kiss and he beams.SARAH: Where's Hoggle?LUDO: Hoggle ... in ... bad ... door.SARAH: We've got to find him! Do you think we can?LUDO is very confident. He spent a lot of time with the WISE ONE.LUDO: Ludo ... knows ... doors ...He ambles off with SARAH following.LUDO: also ... portal ... or entrance ...49	INT: HOLE - DAYHOGGLE is more depressed than ever. The peach is nowhere to be seen.Suddenly LUDO's head appears above.LUDO: Hoggle ... all ... wet.HOGGLE almost jumps out of his skin and then is totally outraged.HOGGLE: Ain't that the clever observation, ya feeble excuse fer athinkin' creature!SARAH appears from behind LUDO.SARAH: Be nice, Hoggle. Or we won't get you out.HOGGLE's face lights up and all thoughts of anger are forgotten.HOGGLE: Missy!50	INT: FOREST - DAYSARAH, HOGGLE and LUDO march through thick, overgrown forest. They donot know that they are being spied on by JARETH'S GOBLINS.51	INT: CLEARING - DAYThe THREESOME emerge into a clearing and see that they have come to awide fissure that goes off in either direction as far as the eye cansee. It is spanned by a rickety bridge held by two thick wooden postson either side of the gap. SARAH eyes the bridge warily.SARAH: It doesn't look too strong but we don't have much choice ...Suddenly they are interrupted by a high-pitched, but powerful voice.VOICE (VO): Halt! Halt or be slain forthwith!At first they don't see a thing and look around for the source of thevoice. Then, the imposing 18 inch high figure of DIDYMUS, resplendentin rakish hat and swashbuckling sword, emerges from behind one of theposts and stands in front of the bridge. LUDO and SARAH aredumbstruck. HOGGLE, however, is not at a loss for words.HOGGLE: Out of our way, ya wretched little rodent ...DIDYMUS looks directly at HOGGLE.DIDYMUS: You, sir, shall be the first to feel the point of my sword!HOGGLE snorts with derision and SARAH tries a more sensible approach.SARAH: Please, we really have to cross this bridge. It's a matter oflife and death!DIDYMUS shrugs elegantly.DIDYMUS: Under any other circumstances I would hasten to oblige you,fair damsel, for your mission sounds a worthy one.SARAH: Oh, it is!DIDYMUS: But I am sworn. Without my permission, none may pass.SARAH throws up her hands and HOGGLE mumbles under his breath. Itappears to be up to LUDO to break the deadlock. He lifts DIDYMUS upinto the air and moves him to one side. They then start to walktoward the bridge and DIDYMUS chases them, brandishing his sword.DIDYMUS: You dishonor me, varlets! En garde!To his chagrin they ignore him and keep walking.DIDYMUS: Rapscallions! Duel ... or _die_!This gets their attention and they turn to look at him, annoyed.HOGGLE: What _is_ this weasel babblin' about?It is too much for DIDYMUS. He flings himself at HOGGLE with a mightywar cry. HOGGLE tries to run for it but DIDYMUS is right behind him,administering more than a few pinpricks in embarrassing places.HOGGLE dives behind a bush and DIDYMUS sniffs at his cowardice. Hecomes back and faces LUDO.DIDYMUS: It is you I want, rogue of rogues. You who dealt me thegravest affront!And with that he jabs LUDO in the foot! LUDO is stunned, and howling,begins to hop on his good foot. DIDYMUS, his head thrown back for atriumphant yell, goes after LUDO with his sword flashing and there isnothing for LUDO to do but pick up a branch and defend himself. It isthe most mismatched duel in the history of chivalrous absurdityDIDYMUS moving at an incredible speed, parrying the mighty swipes ofLUDO's branch with great skill -- and no small amount of difficulty.And LUDO fending off the incessant pinpricks of the little sword,leaping about with surprising agility -- and at a rate that exhaustshim totally. Finally, the two of them, breathing heavily, lower theirweapons. And, to everyone's surprise, DIDYMUS throws down his sword.DIDYMUS: I no longer wish to slay you, for you are a truly nobleknight.Then DIDYMUS strides up to him and, craning his neck, attempts tolook LUDO in the eyes.DIDYMUS: Destroy me if you will.LUDO quickly drops his branch in response. The whole thing has upsethis gentle nature terribly. DIDYMUS then holds out a tiny paw.DIDYMUS: Never have I met my match in battle, yet you, noble knight,have fought me to a standstill.LUDO kneels and tentatively takes DIDYMUS' paw into his own huge hand.DIDYMUS: Let us be brothers henceforth, and fight for the right asone!SARAH cheers and HOGGLE, unimpressed, rubs his sore rear. LUDOsmiles from ear to ear.LUDO: Ludo ... get ... brother!Then he and DIDYMUS exchange the ritual kiss on each cheek, which intheir case is not easily accomplished. SARAH then turns practical.SARAH: Well, now that that's settled let's get going.She heads for the bridge but DIDYMUS blocks her way.DIDYMUS: You forget my sacred vow, my lady. I cannot let you pass.SARAH is incensed.SARAH: But you said Ludo was your brother! How can you refuse him?!!DIDYMUS: I have taken an oath. I must defend it to the death.HOGGLE, enraged, turns on LUDO.HOGGLE: Some brother he turned out ta be!LUDO: Brother ... good!HOGGLE: Well, if he's so good, why won't he let us get on with ourbusiness?LUDO scratches his head. He has no idea. SARAH sits down beside thecrestfallen DIDYMUS.SARAH: OK, let's handle this thing logically. What exactly have yousworn?DIDYMUS brandishes his sword.DIDYMUS: I have sworn with my life-blood, no one shall pass this waywithout my permission.SARAH: Then may we ... _have your permission_?DIDYMUS is stunned. HOGGLE and LUDO barely breathe. Slowly DIDYMUSlooks all around and then, with a courage greater than any he hasever had to call on before, he says it.DIDYMUS: Yes.And the sky doesn't fall, and the earth doesn't heave, and everythingis exactly as it should be.SARAH: Thank you.DIDYMUS breathes a sigh of relief and steps aside to let them pass.LUDO is the first one to go over and that is unfortunate. Because therickety bridge collapses under his weight. SARAH and HOGGLE jump backon the ground near DIDYMUS just in time and poor LUDO swings over thedeep fissure, hanging on to one of the ropes that held the bridge.With a mighty effort he hoists himself up on to the opposite side andlooks forlornly over at the others.SARAH: Oh no!SARAH crumples to the ground, and stares miserably at the brokenbridge.HOGGLE: Now see what ya done, ya mush-brained mammoth!DIDYMUS: I, Sir Didymus, take responsibility for the actions of mybrother, my lady. Lash out at me if you must.SARAH: I'm not mad at Ludo, Sir Didymus. I'm just upset because timeis running out and I have to rescue my baby brother.DIDYMUS is struck to the very roots of his chivalry.DIDYMUS: You mean to rescue _a child_?!!SARAH: The goblin king took him, and I've only got ...She takes out the watch. The hour hand is on the 5.SARAH: ... five hours to get him back.DIDYMUS yells across to LUDO.DIDYMUS: Is this your quest, too, my brother?LUDO: Save ... baby.DIDYMUS is overwhelmed.DIDYMUS: Then I shall join you, lady. I am at your service, upon mysword.He bows low before SARAH and she smiles.SARAH: I happily accept your fealty, Sir Didymus.HOGGLE frowns with displeasure at this latest development.HOGGLE: This is all well an' good, Missy. But we still got one littleproblem.They all look across the fissure at LUDO.LUDO: Ludo ... friends.HOGGLE: Yes, yes. We're friends. Very nice. What's that got ta dowith us gettin' over there without a bridge?LUDO: Rocks ... friends.HOGGLE: We're wastin' our time, Missy. Let's you an' me go findanother ...He is interrupted by LUDO bellowing, which is followed by asympathetic rumbling. Suddenly rocks pile in from both directionsuntil there is a pile in the fissure high enough for them to walkacross.LUDO: Rocks ... friends!SARAH (laughing): They sure are, Ludo!She skips happily across followed by a sullen HOGGLE. DIDYMUSwhistles and is quickly joined by a tail-wagging SHEEPDOG. SARAHgasps, he is the spitting image of her own MERLIN.SARAH: It's ...DIDYMUS: Ambrosius! My noble steed.SARAH laughs and shrugs. Nothing surprises her in the labyrinth.52	EXT: FOREST - NIGHTThe edge of the forest. From here you can see the castle in thedistance, just across the dry, cracked plain. The sky is full ofstars. SARAH, HOGGLE, LUDO and DIDYMUS are sitting around a fire.DIDYMUS: What will you do after we save the child, my lady?SARAH: Take him home, of course! That is, if I can figure out how.DIDYMUS: What is your kingdom like? Do you have many knights todefend your honor?SARAH: Not even one.DIDYMUS: It cannot be! What bitter place is this that does suchdishonor to my lady?SARAH: It's a place where ... where nobody really sees me.LUDO: Ludo ... see ... Sarah!SARAH: (laughs) I know you do, Ludo. (she turns to Didymus) Andthanks to you, Sir Didymus, I finally have a knight.He bows graciously. HOGGLE, who has been watching this scene, feelsrejected and miserable. He gets up and wanders away from the fire.After a moment, SARAH follows him.SARAH: Don't you feel like resting?HOGGLE: I ain't tired.SARAH: Me neither. What I am is hungry.HOGGLE winces but SARAH doesn't notice. SARAH looks back at LUDO andDIDYMUS. LUDO lies on his back snoring loudly. DIDYMUS dozes againstAMBROSIUS' side.SARAH: They're both wonderful, aren't they?HOGGLE: They're alright.SARAH: They're more than that! They're loyal and strong ... and withtheir help I'm going to beat Jareth!HOGGLE shakes his head sadly. SARAH speaks as an afterthought.SARAH: And yours, too, of course.HOGGLE: I ain't no fighter ...She shrugs that off and wanders away to look out at the castle.HOGGLE goes through agony for a moment, and then makes a decision.HOGGLE: Missy ... if you're hungry ...He holds out the peach that JARETH gave him: the world's mostdelicious looking peach.SARAH: Oh, great!She happily taken the peach and bites. It takes everything HOGGLE hasto not put his hands over his ears. She takes another bite and thenstumbles.SARAH (laughing): Everything's dancing ...She looks up at the sky, exhilarated.SARAH: Even the stars are dancing!HOGGLE turns and walks back to the fire. SARAH stumbles about as shegazes happily at the sky.53	INT: CASTLE - NIGHTFREDDIE is leading the GOBLINS on a merry chase. He crawls around theroom, pulling things off shelves. A GOBLIN is on his hands and kneesin front of JARETH polishing his boots. JARETH kicks the GOBLIN andsends him flying across the room. This makes FREDDIE laugh and hepulls a book off the shelf and throws it. It hits a GOBLIN on thehead. JARETH scoops up FREDDIE and puts him in his cradle. He sitsdown next to him.JARETH: Little goblin-to-be, I have something to amuse you.He waves his hands in front of FREDDIE and suddenly beautifulcrystalline balls appear in them. He runs them over his fingers likeso many coins, their molten light so dazzling that FREDDIE kicks uphis legs with excitement. And WE CAN SEE that at the end of hispajamas are two wizened goblin feet! JARETH laughs and flings theballs into the air and they turn into bubbles, beautiful, mesmerizingbubbles.JARETH: Soon, little one. Very, very soon ...And they both watch the bubbles as they fly out the window and overthe labyrinth, coldly beautiful against the darkening sky.54	EXT: FOREST - NIGHTSARAH's hand opens slowly and the half-eaten peach falls to theground. She stares out into the sky, mesmerized. The bubbles areapproaching; dazzling, dancing bubbles. And then she hears music,haunting, spell-casting music. The bubbles come closer and WE CAN SEEthat each one contains a TWIRLING DANCER, a DANCER just like the onein SARAH's music box. She gets up and follows them.ANOTHER ANGLEHOGGLE watching from the woods.HOGGLE: Damn you, Jareth! (He turns and begins to walk away) And damnme too!ANOTHER ANGLEA bubble, with SARAH inside it, floating through the sky. She appearsenchanted, and she begins to twirl, just like the OTHER DANCERS.55	EXT: BALLROOM - NIGHTA giant bubble, with a magnificent ballroom inside it. Tiny bubblesrush to join it. In one of them is SARAH.56	INT: BALLROOM - NIGHTThe music changes and now SARAH is inside the ballroom. It is amagnificent spectacle with all the beauty and decadence of an 18thCentury Venetian ball. Magnificently dressed DANCERS swirl to themusic in an incredibly opulent setting. But when you look closer yousense decay just beneath the surface; things are threadbare, faded.The GUESTS wear masks that are elegant parodies of goblin faces,giving them all a slightly sinister look. And there is something veryprovocative about all of them; the WOMEN have bare shoulders anddaring decolletage, many of the MEN have their shirts open to thewaist. Some of them lounge against the wall indolently and there isthe feeling that the party has been going on all night. In thissetting SARAH is the picture of innocence. TWO WOMEN snickeringbehind their fans as SARAH approaches, and she is suddenly terriblyself-conscious. How plain She feels amidst all this! She looks intoone of the many mirrors that line the ballroom and sighs at herimage. Then suddenly she sees something in the mirror that makes hergasp.ANOTHER ANGLEThe mirror, and in it the reflection of a resplendent JARETH dancingwith a particularly exotic-looking WOMAN. SARAH whirls around, tryingto get another glimpse of JARETH. She is so intent on trying to seehim that she doesn't notice that she is being stared at brazenly by aYOUNG MAN leaning against the wall. He moves next to her and whisperssomething into her ear. She hurries away, shocked; and the YOUNG MANthrows back his head and laughs. And JARETH sees the whole thing.ANOTHER ANGLESARAH is approached by a MIDDLE-AGED MAN who has a box hanging atwaist height from a ribbon around his neck. It looks like SARAH'smusic box. She looks down at it with interest and he throws open thecover. But there is no dancer inside, instead there is a stick carvedlike a snake. It shoots out at SARAH and she cries out and backsaway. ALL THE PEOPLE around her laugh and she moves hurriedly on.JARETH, who is dancing with an even more beautiful WOMAN than before,watches SARAH.ANOTHER ANGLESARAH is looking for JARETH. She spots him and sees him whispersomething to his partner who smiles knowingly from beneath her maskand licks her lips. SARAH blushes and turns away and finds herselflooking into another mirror. But in the reflection, JARETH isn't witha partner. He is standing alone, the DANCERS a whirling blur aroundhim, and he is looking straight at her. SARAH, whirling around toface the crowd and she sees JARETH with yet a third BEAUTY. And thenshe realizes that it is herself! In a trance-like state she movesthrough the CROWD to get a better look.ANOTHER ANGLESARAH'S POV - She is whirling in JARETH's arms, and she is the mostbeautiful woman at the ball. JARETH smiles down at her and theattraction between them is palpable.JARETH: You look like a queen.SARAH looks up at him, thrilled by his words.SARAH: I ... I feel like ... I ... don't know what I feel ...JARETH (smiling): Don't you?And he whirls her around dizzyingly, so dizzyingly that she swoons inhis arms. He catches her before she can fall very far, tightening hisgrip around her waist.SARAH: Are we ... are we in a bubble?JARETH: Yes, we are. A dream bubble ... where your dreams can cometrue.ANOTHER ANGLEOUR SARAH is being jostled by the crowd. She stumbles and almostfalls on top of a COUPLE on a bench. The WOMAN is sprawled across thelap of the MAN who wears a mask with a very phallic nose. SARAH backsaway from them, frightened.ANOTHER ANGLEJARETH and SARAH, dancing. She is smiling up at him, he has neverlooked more handsome. There is something more open about him, as ifhe, too, is caught up in the moment. He nuzzles her hair with hislips and whispers in her ear.JARETH (whispering): My Queen!Then he begins a song. A song that tells SARAH he will give hereverything she wants, even things she doesn't know she wants. A songthat says forget it all; all the restrictions, all the powerlessness.Forget and stay in the dream.ANOTHER ANGLEOUR SARAH watches, mesmerized. But every time she tries to get closerto JARETH and SARAH she in jostled by a lascivious ADMIRER, pushedout of the way by WOMEN laughingly being chased by MEN. She stumblesagainst a wall and a door opens. Inside, pillow feathers are flyingand she can't make out what the SEVERAL PEOPLE are doing. A WOMANcomes up to the doorway, winks at SARAH, and closes the door.ANOTHER ANGLEJARETH finishes the song and SARAH looks up at him, smiling. He moveshis face closer to hers and she closes her eyes. His face comescloser, and closer.ANOTHER ANGLEOUR SARAH shrinks back from what she is seeing. She turns and runs,pushing herself though the languid CROWD, right into the bubbleitself.57	EXT: BALL - NIGHTSARAH comes crashing through the bubble and the whole ballroomcrumbles. In seconds it resembles nothing so much as a junkyard.58	EXT JUNK CITY - NIGHTSARAH runs through the streets of a part-market, part-junkyard. Thereare piles of rubble and junk everywhere, and between them are tentsfrom which PEOPLE hawk objects of all kinds. Some of them approachSARAH and she pushes them away, sobbing.ANOTHER ANGLESARAH'S POV - A RED TENT, and standing in front of it is an OLD WOMANstooped over from the objects piled high on her back. She beckons toSARAH and pulls the tent flap aside.JUNK WOMAN: 'Ere it is, Dearie. All the fings you want, all the fingsyou need.ANOTHER ANGLEThe flap opens wider and inside the tent WE CAN SEE SARAH's room!ANOTHER ANGLESARAH gasps at the sight and runs headlong into the tent. She tripsover the threshold and lands face down on her bed.59	INT: SARAH'S ROOM - NIGHTSARAH sits up on the bed and looks around the room. She shakes herhead and laughs.SARAH: What a dream!She gets up and stretches, then walks over to the mirror. She smilesat her reflection.SARAH: Yep, you've got quite an imagination, kid, Just what a greatactress needs.She walks over to the bed and picks up Lancelot the bear.SARAH: How about a midnight snack, Sir Lance ...She goes over to the door and opens it.60	EXT: JUNK CITY - NIGHTSARAH'S POV - THE MARKET/JUNKYARD TEEMING WITH ACTIVITY.The JUNK WOMAN peers in.JUNK WOMAN: 'Aven't you got everythin' you need, Dearie?61	INT: SARAH'S ROOM - NIGHTSARAH screams and slams the door.

Don'tknow what might 'appen to you out 'ere.63	INT: SARAH'S ROOM - NIGHTSARAH clams the door again and rushes over to the window. A GROUP OFREVELLERS peer in at her and laugh. She quickly pulls the curtainsclosed and walks back to the center of the room. She stands clutchingthe bear, then looks up at her reflection in the mirror.ANOTHER ANGLESARAH'S reflection. Herself as a very old woman, clutching a teddybear.OLD SARAH: Best to stay in here where it's safe. Don't know whatmight happen to you out there.SARAH steps back from the mirror and suddenly the floor becomes a seaof mud and all the objects in the room come falling down on her.

LUDO tries clumsily to get down and is tormented byGOBLINS who prick at him with their spears. SARAH looks up and seeshis predicament. She gets an idea.SARAH: Call the rocks, Ludo! Call the rocks!LUDO makes a heroic effort and gets to the top of the wall.He then throws his head back and bellows.76	EXT: GOBLIN TOWN - NIGHTAn enormous rumbling is heard and soon the streets are filled withboulders, all careening towards LUDO.

It turns a corner and starts yapping for all it's worth.ANOTHER ANGLESARAH, LUDO and DIDYMUS pressed against the wall, trying to not benoticed.

It stands at their feet, making a ruckus.SARAH (whispering): Shut up, you little monster!LUDO bends down to pet it in the hopes of quieting it.LUDO: Nice ... thing ...But the CREATURE doesn't want a pet.

Opposite them is alarge ornate door. They have a lead on the GOBLINS chasing them, butnot for long.ANOTHER ANGLEOn one of the balconies a particularly repulsive little GOBLIN laughssadistically. The THREE look up and see the GOBLIN with his hands ona huge lever. He pushes it down gleefully and the floor opens up infront of the THREESOME. It appears to be a bottomless pit, too wideto leap across. Horrified they look behind them and see the GOBLINSgaining on them. And they're throwing spears! Suddenly there is atriumphant yell from the balcony opposite the repulsive GOBLIN, andthen a FIGURE leaps off it swinging on a rope.SARAH: Hoggle!It certainly is! He wrestles with the hideous GOBLIN and in thestruggle it falls screaming into the pit. HOGGLE then grabs the leverand it is not a second too soon. The pursuing GOBLINS are enteringthe courtyard.ANOTHER ANGLEThe floor closes and the THREE run to the door. An enraged PURSUERaims a spear at HOGGLE. He is hit. SARAH screams as LUDO struggleswith the door. It won't budge and he begins to smash his body againstit.ANOTHER ANGLEA seemingly half-dead HOGGLE staggers to his feet and throws his bodyon the lever. He appears to faint from the strain but the weight ofhis body pushes the lever and the floor opens again.ANOTHER ANGLEThe enraged GOBLINS are stopped in their tracks by the yawning pit.They hurl spears at the THREESOME but it is to no avail. LUDO smashesdown the door and they run in.83	INT: JARETH'S QUARTERS - NIGHTSARAH, DIDYMUS, and LUDO carrying HOGGLE enter the room where we haveseen JARETH and FREDDIE. They lock the door behind them. No one isthere and FREDDIE's cradle is rocking, as if someone had removed himonly moments before. LUDO places HOGGLE down and SARAH looksfeverishly around the room. She spots a door.SARAH: That's the only way he could have gone!She runs to the door and LUDO and DIDYMUS follow.SARAH: No. I have to face him alone!DIDYMUS: But, my lady ...He is interrupted by the sound of GOBLINS in pursuit. They starttrying to smash down the door. LUDO runs to it and presses his bodyagainst it. HOGGLE moans and DIDYMUS and SARAH run to his side.HOGGLE: I don't expect ya to fergive me, Missy, but ...She puts her finger to his lips.SARAH: Forgive you for what? Saving our lives?HOGGLE: But, I betrayed ya, I gave ya that damned peach ...SARAH: Ssh!

Just in case you change your mind.She slips off her mother's ring and presses it into HOGGLE's hand.

Her kneesbuckling from vertigo. Then she gasps.ANOTHER ANGLEJARETH is sitting on the wall with all the ease of a fly.JARETH: I've been expecting you.SARAH stumbles and falls into the room, ending up on the ceiling. Shetries to adjust to being upside down.SARAH: Where's Freddie?!!!She has to look down and sideways to see JARETH and it is clearlygrueling.JARETH: He's right there.And he points to one of the stairways that juts out at a right anglefrom the wall. FREDDIE is climbing up the stairs happily, but fromSARAH's point of view it looks like he will fall when he gets to thetop.SARAH (screaming): Freddie! No!!!FREDDIE gets to the top but doesn't fall, instead he ends up crawlingup the wall. SARAH sighs with relief and closes her eyes. This sendsher reeling and she ends up in one of the archways. She tries toorient herself but there is no up, no down, no sideways. And the BABYis about to crawl off a balcony! SARAH screams and JARETH laughs. Hebegins a song that tells SARAH she never really understood what wasgain on. Nothing is what it appears to be, not even things like "up"and "down."ANOTHER ANGLEFREDDIE in the most precarious-looking situation yet, at the top of astaircase. He hesitates to crawl down, and to lure him, JARETHcreates a ball out of thin air and throws it to the BABY. Of course,it bounces up. And all the while his song is taunting SARAH. Sheturns away from him and looks into the large mirror framed in thearchway. She sees endless SARAHS. And while she's looking, the firstreflection runs to the left, the reflection behind that to the right,and so on all the way down the line. And SARAH's still standingthere! She falls backwards and ends up standing on the floor,watching FREDDIE chase his ball across the ceiling. JARETH dances onthe wall now as he is about to finish his song. And there is FREDDIEon one of the balconies facing out of the rotunda. If he falls offthat, he'll really fall! SARAH runs up the opposite wall and findsthat there is sheer space between her and the BABY. The only way toreach him is to jump. She looks at JARETH who grins at her, then atFREDDIE who is teetering on the edge. As JARETH comes to the end ofthe song there is nothing to do but jump. She looks at JARETH andcan't repress a grin of her own.SARAH: Like the man said, "nothing is what it appears to be!"She jumps.85	INT: JARETH'S CHAMBERS - NIGHTSARAH falls right on to a magnificent huge bed. Opposite her JARETHsits in a chair. FREDDIE, wrapped in a blanket, is gurgling on hislap. SARAH reaches into her pocket and pulls out the watch. It is afew minutes before 13. JARETH stands up.JARETH: There's still time.He gestures to a clock on the wall that shows the same time as herwatch. He places FREDDIE into a cradle and comes over to the bed. Helooks down at her.JARETH: Besides, I'm no longer interested in having a little goblinprince. I've decided I'd much rather have a queen.He looks into her eyes for a moment. SARAH doesn't look away.Instead, she slowly eases herself off the bed and stands facing him.SARAH (archly): A queen? Have you chosen anyone I know.She glides by him and walks to the window. JARETH chucklesappreciatively.JARETH: You've come a long way, little girl.SARAH looks out at the labyrinth.SARAH: I certainly have.She turns to face him.JARETH: Yes, I can see it in your eyes. (he moves closer to her) Noone else has ever made it this far in the labyrinth, no one else hasever been worthy ...He takes her hand and brings it to his lips. She smilesdown at him.SARAH: What's your offer.JARETH stands quickly and looks at her. She certainly has come a longway!JARETH: Why, everything ... you'll rule by my side.SARAH: Everything? The chance to spend my life surrounded byrepulsive goblins ... the chance to torment innocent creatures ...JARETH (shaking his head): ... the chance to never have a care in theworld, to never have to do anything that you don't want to do.SARAH looks at him.SARAH: Anything else?JARETH (smiling): Why, me. Of course.SARAH surreptitiously eyes the clock. There is about a minute left.She glides away from the window and tries to position herself closerto FREDDIE.SARAH: And what if I'm not interested?JARETH reacts with surprise for a moment, then shakes his head.JARETH: Impossible. I know you, I know what you want ...SARAH: Well, I've got news for you, Jareth.She makes a beeline for the cradle.SARAH: I don't want _you_!She's almost at the cradle but JARETH grabs her arm and stops her.SARAH (shocked, enraged): Why, you miserable creep!JARETH has hold of her arms but she breaks away and hauls off andpunches him in the jaw. JARETH steps back, stunned. SARAH scoops upthe screaming FREDDIE.SARAH: How could you do this to an innocent baby?!!JARETH stands rubbing his jaw, snivelling, stunned.JARETH: You hit me!SARAH, FREDDIE in her arms, goes right up to him.SARAH: And I'd like to do more ... you, you ... !She is furious and wants to hit him again badly. Since she has theBABY in her arms she makes do with kicking him hard in the shin.JARETH howls and grabs his leg.SARAH: I wouldn't want you if you were the last ... _goblin_ on earth!The WHITE BIRD flies through the window and lands on SARAH'sshoulder. JARETH puts his hands on his ears.JARETH: Don't say that!But it is too late, he starts shrinking.JARETH: Look at me! (whining) How could you do this to me!Before SARAH's eyes JARETH turns into an undersized, ineffective,snivelling little GOBLIN. The features are those of a goblin, butstill recognizably JARETH.86	INT: CASTLE - NIGHTJARETH's quarters, where DIDYMUS tends HOGGLE and LUDO still blocksthe door.JARETH (VO) (whiney scream): Why does everything have to happen to me!They look at each other and suddenly LUDO realizes that the GOBLINSare no longer trying to break down the door.

She looks at the clockand the minute hand moves to the 13. She looks at FREDDIE. There'snothing to do but jump into the void. The clock begins to strike.SARAH: OK, Freddie. Time to go bye-bye!She jumps.88	EXT: SKY - NIGHTSARAH and FREDDIE spinning through the dark, starry sky. The strikingof the clock continues.ANOTHER ANGLECLOSE ON SARAH AND FREDDIE.

When she cansee, she gasps. FREDDIE's not there! The side of the crib is down andthe BABY is nowhere to be seen.SARAH: Freddie!She leaps to her feet woozily. Still rubbing her head she staggersout into the hallway.90	INT: RAILWAY - NIGHTSARAH looks down the hallway and suddenly her face breaks out into adelighted grin.ANOTHER ANGLESARAH'S POV - LITTLE FREDDIE is crawling slowly, but determinedly,into SARAH's room. When he gets to her bed he uses all his strengthto pull himself up on to his feet by holding on to the bedspread. Bethen holds his hand out, trying to reach something.ANOTHER ANGLESARAH makes her way toward her room, delight and wonder on her face.91	INT: SARAH'S ROOM - NIGHTSARAH stands in the doorway looking down at FREDDIE.SARAH (softly): That's quite a journey you took, Freddie.FREDDIE looks up at her and makes a sound. He continues straining,and WE SEE that what he is reaching for is Lancelot, SARAH's bear.SARAH smiles, and lifts FREDDIE up. She sits on the bed, FREDDIE onher lap, and hands him the bear.SARAH: Here. It's yours.FREDDIE takes it happily.SARAH (smiling): You earned it.She kisses his head and rocks him gently.
