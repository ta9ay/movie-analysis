FIRST BLOOD II: THE MISSION by James Cameron December 22, 1983FADE IN:TITLE SEQUENCEEXT. V.A. HOSPITAL - DAYA drab GREEN SEDAN with U.S. ARMY printed on the doorstops at the steps of a fortress-like colonial-stylebuilding.Iron bars cover the windows.The lawn sprinklers snap mindlessly to themselves.A CRT-style printout appears at the bottom of FRAME: D-MINUS 117 HRS FAYETTEVILLE, NORTH CAROLINAANGLE ON SEDANas the doors open and TWO POWERFUL MPs, one of whom wasdriving, emerge. The other opens the rear door forCOLONEL SAMUEL TRAUTMAN who stands, eyeing the imposingfacade of the hospital.Trautman is in his early fifties and wears the mantle ofcommand sternly but without arrogance.He takes the stairs with purposeful strides, the MPsfalling in behind him.HOLD ON THE SIGN above the main door as they go inside: VETERANS ADMINISTRATION HOSPITALINT. HOSPITALA gray metal door bearing the sign "NEUROPSYCHIATRIC WING"bangs open and a massive ORDERLY in white passes through.He is followed by the two MPs, Trautman, and a SHORTDOCTOR who hustles to keep up with the others.LOW ANGLE DOLLY PRECEDING the entourage as they strideforward.The MPs are grim-faced and walk in step.Trautman and a doctor SINGLETERRY silently walk throughthe corridor.They pass the open day-room where somnambulistic patientssit like statuary watching "The Young and the Restless" orwatching the wallpaper fade.Bleak light from an overcast day filters through thebarred window.The vets seem older than their years and although someshow the physical scars of combat, there is no doubt thatthe greatest trauma for these men is behind the eyes.As they pass the open doors of the rooms of the "chronicward", haunted eyes turn toward them.As they approach the nurse's station for the "chronicward" the orderly nods.The HEAD NURSE turns to her console.INSERT - AS NURSE'S HANDhits a button on the console.TIGHT ON SECURITY DOORas a solenoid-operated bolt snaps back with a loud BUZZCLACK.The orderly's good hand shoves the door open.INT. "VIOLENT" WARDThe entourage enters a long narrow corridor lined withlocked doors.POV DOLLYING ALONG CORRIDOROccasionally faces appear at the safety-glass windows setin the doors. Men whose souls have fled.Their eyes track us as we move past.An emaciated MAN in an untied hospital smock and bare feetstands as if lost in the center of the corridor.REVERSE ON GROUPDOLLYING as they detour around the man, whose clawlikehand catches at Trautman's tunic.A hoarse, demented SHOUTING issues from one of the doors,a desperate WAILING from another.INT. STAIRWELLCLOSE ON DOOR LATCH as keys RATTLE and the door opens.WIDER as the group enters a dark service stairwell. Thesingle fluorescent light flickers stroboscopically, apulsing twilight. LEWIS Shit. Maintenance never gets down here.They descend two flights to a door of steel bars on asliding track.The MPs flank Lewis as he unlocks the door. SINGLETERRY So what am I supposed to do? Can't transfer him to Leavenworth. He's civilian. So I put him in an isolation cell that hasn't been used since the Spanish Inquisition.TIGHT ON BARRED DOORrolling aside on metal tracks. CLANG.INT. CORRIDORThis area of the hospital's basement has been used forlittle but storage in recent years.Stacks of obsolete equipment gathers dust, leaving only anarrow walkspace.The steel doors of the isolation cells yawn open, exceptfor the last one. TRAUTMAN Maybe you should have tried cutting him some slack.Lewis opens a cabinet near the single locked cell andremoves a SMALL RIFLE. He feeds a SYRINGE-LIKE SHELL intothe single-shot bolt action. TRAUTMAN (continuing) What's that? SINGLETERRY Tranquilizer syrette gun. Borrowed it from the Animal Control Department.Trautman pushes the barrel aside with a contemptuous snortand steps up to the cell door. TRAUTMAN Gimme a break. (nods toward door) Open it.The two MPs flank the door. One pulls on the latchinglever. Bolts slide. The door swings open, revealingblackness. LEWIS (muttering) Thinks he's the fucking Prince of Darkness.One MP tries the switch beside the cell, flicking itseveral times. Nothing.He glances apprehensively at the other MP and they stepinto the dark cell.INT. CELLTIGHT ON A HAND, dimly outlined, as it twists a light bulba half-turn in its socket.In the sudden light the MPs face an imposing figure.JOHN RAMBO, wearing only a pair of filthy jeans, stands"ready" before them. The single light bulb on the lowceiling sends glistening highlights over his taught body.A nasty piece of machinery.Long, matted hair coils onto his shoulders, and an unkemptbeard heightens the cheekbones beneath eyes which aredeep, reptilian. Intense.His position, though not overtly threatening, suggests awillingness to strike without warning which gives theM.P.'s pause.Trautman steps forward between the MPs. TRAUTMAN At ease, Rambo.MED. ON RAMBOrising from his slight crouch to stand composed,balanced... parade rest. TRAUTMAN (continuing to MPs) Wait outside.He closes the door until it latches. TRAUTMAN Hello, John. RAMBO Colonel. TRAUTMAN Mind if I sit down?Rambo motions to the narrow bunk, dropping into anOriental squat himself as the Colonel sits.Trautman's manner with Rambo is familiar, somehowpaternal. A bit of an ironic grin twitches briefly. TRAUTMAN (continuing) I hear you're not enjoying it here. RAMBO I could take it or leave it.Trautman sighs and leans back. TRAUTMAN Seems like I'm always pulling you out of some goddamn toilet or other, doesn't it? RAMBO Am I out of here? TRAUTMAN That depends on you. (pause) Christ, look at you. I give you this easy duty until I can get you an assignment... all you have to do is eat ice cream and watch soap operas... and you have to make it Rambo's last stand. RAMBO There were treating me like a headcase. TRAUTMAN Hard to believe. You shoot up one little town in Oregon with a fifty caliber machine gun... one little dogpatch town... and everybody figures your wrapper's broken. No sense of humor. (pause) What did you expect? An engraved plague from the chamber of commerce?Rambo looks at his hands. When he finally speaks hisvoice seems distant, disembodied. RAMBO In 'Nam I flew gunships. Million dollar equipment. Back here nobody trusts me to park cars. I keep thinking it's going to be okay... but I've been out six years and it's not okay. Sometimes I feel like I'm coming right out of my skin.The colonel nods slowly. He notices a battered shoebox onthe floor beside the bed. The cell is absolutely devoidof personal articles otherwise. TRAUTMAN This your stuff? RAMBO That's it. My life.TIGHT ON SHOEBOXas Trautman flips through a number of worn snapshots ofthe men in Rambo's special forces unit.They are horsing around, in and out of uniform. Ayounger, cleanshaven Rambo is among them. He is grinningbroadly in one shot.It seems uncharacteristic of the hardened man we see now. TRAUTMAN Hardcore outfit. The best I ever trained. RAMBO (coldly) Those men are all dead. TRAUTMAN (glancing up) You're not.He fishes something from among the pathetic debris ofRambo's life. TRAUTMAN (continuing) Congressional Medal of Honor. RAMBO (bitterly) Yeah. Big time. TRAUTMAN Plus, what else? Two Silver Stars, four Bronze Stars, two Soldier's Medals, four Vietnamese Crosses of Gallantry and... uh, a handful of Purple Hearts. RAMBO Five. I never wanted that stuff. TRAUTMAN What did you want? RAMBO (haltingly) I just wanted... I don't know... after all that... I just wanted one person, one person, to come up to me and say "you did good, John." And mean it. That's all. (pause) After all that. TRAUTMAN You just picked that wrong war to be a hero in.The colonel studies Rambo a moment, then stands abruptly. TRAUTMAN (continuing) Let's take a walk. CUT TO:EXT. V.A. HOSPITAL - DAYRambo and Trautman cross the manicured grounds, escortedby the two grim MPs.A number of wheelchair-bound vets enjoy the sunshine B.G.and a desultory game of volleyball is in progress.Still, the impression is of the detritus of war leftscattered on a huge lawn like broken toys.As the two approach a conservatively dressed MAN waitingon a bench under a plane-tree, stands. TRAUTMAN Jason Kirkhill... John Rambo.Kirkhill extends his hand in greeting, but Rambo coollyhalf-turns to reveal his hands, locked in WRIST-CUFFSseparated by a steel bar so that they can hang comfortablyat his sides.Kirkhill grins affably. Drops his hand. KIRKHILL Good to meet you, Rambo. How are you?Rambo scans Kirkhill's face, noting the cold scrutiny allbut concealed in the smile lines. RAMBO (coldly) You a spook?Kirkhill drops the smile. KIRKHILL That's right. CIA Special Operations Division.Rambo turns to Trautman. RAMBO I don't work with spooks. Not after that op in Cambodia. KIRKHILL I'm authorized to get you out of here. I thought that's what you wanted. RAMBO (considering) What's the job? KIRKHILL Classic special forces op... hit fast... in and out. Two men. Two days. RAMBO Why me? KIRKHILL (shrugs non- committally) We like you. (pause) At least the computer at Langley likes you. Pulled your file because of various factors. Service record. Area familiarity. RAMBO Where? KIRKHILL Not yet. RAMBO I'm not jumping blind.Kirkhill's eyes get hard. KIRKHILL It's yes or no. In or out... now. If it's "out," we will not have had this conversation. If you come in, you will not be working for us. No knowledge. No comment. Do you understand?Rambo seems about to turn away. TRAUTMAN (to Kirkhill) Tell him. I'll take responsibility.Kirkhill looks pained, like he has gas. KIRKHILL North Vietnam. What they call the Democratic Republic of Vietnam now.TIGHT ON RAMBOas he takes that in. His eyes seem to see all the waythere already. Emotions go through him. Exhilarationmixing with terror of the demon he can't turn away from.He nods slowly. TRAUTMAN We left some people behind there, John... POWs. RAMBO This just occurred to somebody, now? KIRKHILL We don't leave our men, Rambo.Rambo and Trautman lock eyes.Something flows there... Trautman knows his soul. RAMBO You got it. I'm in.He whips one hand around from his side, tossing themanacle bar at a surprised Kirkhill's feet.The wrist-cuffs are still closed. CUT TO:INT. RAMBO'S CELLRambo stands alone in his cell, the door open behind him.He hefts the shoebox filled with his worldly possessions,the scraps of memory, dead friends, and symbols of valorand violent death.He upends the box, spilling everything into the opentoilet.Flushes it. And walks out. CUT TO:EXT. FORT BRAGG - DUSK D-MINUS 84 HRS FORT BRAGG, NORTH CAROLINATIGHT ON BOOTED FEETclomping in rhythmic lockstep as a platoon of recruitsmarches past in close order drill.The drill sergeant bellows cadence. SERGEANT (O.S.) Three-fo-your-lef, lef-right-lef... Other lef shithead! Square those pieces away... square 'em away girls! I said...WIDERas the platoon marches past, EXITING FRAME to reveal asign mounted beside a security checkpoint in a formidablechain-link fence. AIRBORNE SPECIAL FORCES GROUP OPERATIONS CENTERINT. CORRIDORKirkhill, accompanied by his basilisk-eyed AIDE, stridespast Rambo's two MPs flanking the door, into a smallroom.INT. BRIEFING ROOMThe room is an austere cubicle with the army's typicallydrab furniture in "early functional."The cold eye of a surveillance camera stares down at asingle table with a seated figure... Rambo, looking likehe may have been there for centuries.The aide hands Rambo a sealed folder and extends aclipboard and pen for him to sign off. KIRKHILL This is your mission packet... AIDE (quietly overlapping) Sign here, please. And here. KIRKHILL Memorize it here. It doesn't leave this room.Rambo unseals the folder, removing a sheaf of photocopieddocuments, as Kirkhill perches on the table next to him. KIRKHILL (continuing) The twenty-four hundred American servicemen missing in action in Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia are officially listed "Presumed Killed." Certainly most of them are.Rambo is leafing through the contents of his PACKET. Heskips a stack of reports and fishes out several grainy 8 X10 prints. KIRKHILL (continuing) But reports keep filtering in. Sightings by refugees. Nothing verified. Finally, we feel we've got enough to proceed on.Rambo studies the prints. They seem to be high altitudesurveillance photos of a small COMPOUND OF BUILDINGS,surrounded by forests. KIRKHILL (continuing) Memo E-7 on top will cover the details. An abandoned Vietnamese Army base in the North-central highlands may have a compound used as an internment camp. As you can see the intelligence is soft. These LANDSAT photos show huts... barracks. It could be anything. RAMBO (flat) What's the plan? KIRKHILL This operation is in two phases. Recon and rescue. You are phase one. Your two-man team will probe the site, confirm the presence of American POWs, if any, make photographic and tactical observations, then proceed to the extraction point without engaging the enemy. RAMBO We don't try to pull out any of our guys if we find them? KIRKHILL Negative. Absolutely not. The phase two assault team will get them out. RAMBO (not pleased) We just take pictures? KIRKHILL Don't look so disappointed. It should be hairy enough... even for you. CUT TO:INT. DON MUANG AIRPORT - LATE AFTERNOONKirkhill's VOICE continues over the image of: The crowdedairport terminal, as Rambo, carrying a cheap flight bag,weaves among jostling Orientals. KIRKHILL (V.O.) Your flight to Bangkok is at 06:30. Commercial carrier. Low profile. Rendezvous with Colonel Trautman at the Indra. Room 618. You'll meet your number two man, Lieutenant Brewer. He doesn't get a packet... you brief him verbally.After a flurry of passport stamping Rambo clears customsand makes his way to the main exit.EXT. TAXI STAND - STREET - LATE AFTERNOONRambo emerges into the stifling humid heat of Bangkok inMay and stands, scanning for a cab. D-MINUS 51 HRS BANGKOK, THAILANDBangkok is a city of fervid motion and the street ischaotic with traffic.Stepping through throngs of Asians and tourists Ramboreaches for the door of a beat-to-hell Citroen taxihunkered low at the curb like some metal lungfish.He spins as a hand lightly touches his shoulder. MAN Sorry old buddy, I saw it first.An American in his late twenties, the man speaks with oneof those hard-to-dislike Southern accents. Probably NorthCarolina.He is lanky but muscular, with boyish good looks and haircut so short it barely qualifies as stubble. Thoughdressed in a loud Hawaiian shirt and Madras slacks, it ispainfully obvious the man is military.His arm is draped around a gorgeous but overly made-upThai girl. MAN (affable) I kinda got an important date.Rambo's eyes narrow as he turns wordlessly and climbs intothe taxi.The American grins cockily and tosses his bag to Rambo. MAN No problem. We'll share it. Get your tail in there, sweet thing.INT./ EXT. TAXIThe American and the girl pile into the broad front seat,to the chagrin of the lizard-faced Thai driver. MAN (to driver) Indra Hotel. And don't take the scenic route, Smiley... I know my way around this burg. Comprende?Rambo speaks quietly to the driver in Thai. RAMBO (Thai/subtitled) Same place for me.The girl giggles as the American slips his hand up fromher stockinged knee, between her thighs. MAN Ah, you fair flower of the Orient.She giggles, like a chirping bird. MAN (continuing to Rambo) She thinks everything I say is funny. Don't you, Angel-pie? Man, Thai women are the best. Got the kinda legs I like... feet at one end and pussy at the other.He turns to Rambo, who hasn't commented or taken anyobservable notice of him. MAN (continuing) You don't say a helluva lot, do you, pal? You speak English? RAMBO (coldly) Sometimes.The girl coos to the American in pidgin English. THAI GIRL You got money? I stay you whole week. MAN Sweet thing, there's nothin' I'd like more than to wugga-wugga with you for a week, but tonight's all we got.He lowers his voice conspiratorially, leaning close toher. MAN (continuing) See, I'm on this secret mission, and tomorrow mornin' I head out to...Rambo grabs the man brutally by his collar. RAMBO That's enough, Brewer.The American freezes at the sound of his name. Turnsslowly. BREWER (realizing) You're Rambo? (pause) Ke-rist!Rambo speaks sharply to the girl in Thai. RAMBO (Thai/subtitled) Get out. Now!The driver, confused, skids to a stop and the girl getsout into the din of a cluttered shop district. A flash ofslit skirt and then only fading curses behind them as thetaxi moves on. BREWER (brightening) Jeez, I never would have guessed. You undercover, Lieutenant? Great disguise. CUT TO:INT. INDRA HOTEL ROOM - DUSKTrautman, sipping a gin tonic at the window, spins aroundas the door flies open. Brewer storms in, followed a fewpaces back by Rambo, who closes the door. BREWER (to Trautman) He says he's team leader on this show. TRAUTMAN That's correct. BREWER (controlling his fury) Begging the Colonel's pardon but I understood I was up to lead my next mission. TRAUTMAN Not this one. You're on communications and camera. Same image-intensified gear you used in El Salvador last year. RAMBO This clown almost blew mission security on the street. I'm not jumping with him. BREWER (spinning) Clown? Now back up there, buddy... TRAUTMAN (sharply) Listen up. You two are married as of now. Get used to it. RAMBO (to Trautman) I say we tape him to a chair. CUT TO:EXT. OPERATIONS BASE CAMP - DAY D-MINUS 36 HRS BAN BUNG KHLA, THAILANDA small airstrip transects a meadow bounded by rain-forested slopes. Wreathed in low clouds the mountainsmarch into the distance in increasingly subtler shades ofgray like a Japanese watercolor.Near a cluster of small buildings the scene is one ofmanic but efficient activity as the high tech base camp isassembled.An enormous SIKORSKY CH-54 "SKY CRANE" lowers a Winnebago-sized conex container as another roars by.

Brewer and Trautman, in fatigues, jumpout and join him as Kirkhill approaches.DOLLYING WITH THEM as they emerge from the rotor noise andKirkhill motions them toward the MOBILE TACTICALOPERATIONS CENTER (MTOC). KIRKHILL I didn't know you were a stick man, Rambo. RAMBO I was crossed-trained in gunships. TRAUTMAN (to Kirkhill) How long have you been setting up? KIRKHILL About 22 hours on site. TRAUTMAN Nice work.They pass a tent-like CAMOUFLAGE CANOPY under which anALL-BLACK SIKORSKY UH-60 "BLACKHAWK" HELICOPTER squatsominously. It has no markings or insignia.There is another canopy behind it, the contents of whichare screened from view.Nearby is a cluster of CONEX AIRLIFT CONTAINERS, two ofwhich are joined together to form a building like adouble-wide mobile home.Another unit contains a roaring generator, a fourth istopped by TRACKING GEAR. Cables snake through the mud,connecting the units.Kirkhill notices THREE WORK PARTY "GRUNTS" kibitzingnearby, taking pictures of each other with a pocketInstamatic. He snatches the camera from a surprised youngcorporal. KIRKHILL This is a covert operation, numbnuts.He opens the camera and drops the film in the mud. Thecorporal reaches petulantly for the camera. Kirkhilldrops it casually in the mud as well. KIRKHILL (to Trautman entourage) Check out the command hut.He opens the door to the large conex unit and follows theothers inside.INT. MTOCThe "hut" turns out to be a humming electronic womb.In the subdued light banks of VIDEO MONITORS glow, and thestatus lights of UPRIGHT COMPUTER UNITS line one wall.Workstations for TRACKING, COMMUNICATIONS, AND LONG-RANGECOORDINATION create a claustrophobic jumble of modularequipment racks. BREWER Mission control!They wipe their muddy feet and enter the air-conditionedcommand center.Rambo gazes around at the jumble of gear. He runs hishand over one console, causing a seated technician toglare at him. RAMBO All this is for us? KIRKHILL That's right. BREWER (to Rambo) They call us the field-unit meat- puppets. CUT TO:INT./ EXT. CAMOUFLAGE CANOPY - DAYRambo and Brewer walk in under an expanse of netcamouflage on poles.Sunlight streams through the foliage cover, creatingbright mottles on a black object F.G.CAMERA PULLS BACK and BOOMS UP as Rambo moves forward toreveal the object as an ALL-BLACK JET. It is a modifiedGulfstream "Peregrine," a small sleek single-engineexecutive model, with all insignia and I.D. numbersremoved.MED. ON RAMBO AND BREWERas they consider the aircraft. BREWER Ever do this from a jet? RAMBO No. VOICE (O.S.) It's easy...They turn to see a lanky long-haired man in a leatherflying jacket duck under the fuselage from the far sideand approach them. MAN (grinning) Just have to jump fast.Two other air crewmen jump down from the open rearpassenger door of the plane. RAMBO You the pilot? MAN (extending hand) Yeah. Doyle. (he gestures to the two in the door) Lifer and Fuhrman.Doyle is a product of the sixties' school of ultra-cool,his brain a little torched by too many methed-out night-missions.Fuhrman, the co-pilot, grins too much and Lifer's eyes arejust plain scary. RAMBO You boys Air Force? DOYLE Marines. 'Ex' though. We're private contractors now. LIFER You ever do a tour 'in-country'? RAMBO Two. 'Eye-corps' mostly. DOYLE (to Brewer) How about you?

MOTC - COMMAND HUTTrautman, looking a bit uncomfortable in Kirkhill'selectronic lair, paces behind the seated SpecialOperations Officer. TRAUTMAN How long before you're fully on line? KIRKHILL Couple hours. Let me buy you a coffee.He turns to a vending machine nestled improbably betweentwo racks of electronics. TRAUTMAN You think they'll find any? KIRKHILL (feeding in change) POWs? I don't know. But either way it'll get that subcommittee off our necks. Cream? TRAUTMAN Black. No sugar. KIRKHILL The League of Families leans on Congress. Then they lean on us. Like we don't have enough to worry about in a dozen dirtwater countries. Damnit!He pounds the machine, which refuses to vend.Trautman watches the Special Operations Officer bangingineffectually on the COIN RETURN, amid a million dollarsworth of equipment.EXT. FLIGHT TENTA tent next to the camouflage canopy serves as a flightshack for Doyle and his ground crew. Crates serve astables and stools, and 50-gallon fuel drums are the backwall.Doyle, with Rambo and Brewer, continues the game plan. DOYLE A couple klicks from insertion we go vertical to ten thousand and you punch out. Navigate in free fall like a regular HALO jump. You'll have a good moon. LIFER (to himself) I got your moon right here... BREWER No problem. Duck soup.Doyle notices that Brewer has casually lit up a cigarette. DOYLE Hey, man... we got fuel on the deck. I don't like flying without a plane.Brewer glances at the pool of jet fuel around the pumpingarea.Rambo plucks the cigarette from Brewer's lips. RAMBO No smoking on this mission. It's not healthy.He looks Brewer in the eye and flicks the lit butt intothe pool of gas.Which puts it out. BREWER Son of a bitch!Rambo saunters away. DOYLE (appreciatively) Nice trick.

Now tell me why you pulled the plug. KIRKHILL You think I'm some whacko? I like to hurt people? I'm doing a job here. If I knew what's right or wrong I'd be a goddamned priest, right? So I follow directives... I do what I'm told. It's simple. If your boy had done what he was told, there wouldn't be a problem. TRAUTMAN Don't dance me, Kirkhill. You'll be walking funny.Trautman leans on the .45 a bit and Kirkhill backs intothe seat cushion. KIRKHILL Look, it was a screw-up, alright? They weren't supposed to find anything. We thought that camp was empty. TRAUTMAN This mission was a scam from the word go? KIRKHILL Word came down... they wanted an answer. And they knew the answer they wanted: no POWs. But it had to look good. Best effort. The whole dog-and-pony show.Kirkhill takes a healthy pull from his scotch. TRAUTMAN (realizing) Rambo and Brewer were selected as write-offs. KIRKHILL It was clean. Very clean... Rambo was a decorated Vietnam vet, a former POW himself... if he came out and said "No POWs" the sub-committee would buy it. He gets himself caught he's a private citizen, a whacko, acting on his own. If he gets proof, it gets lost somewhere between here and D.C. Airtight. But no... Rambo's gotta be a hero. Thinks he's starring in his own war movie or something. He put me in a corner. No choice. TRAUTMAN "Terminate with extreme prejudice." KIRKHILL That's a crock. We don't say that. Do you have any idea the shitstorm if he'd gotten back with that guy? If it went public? The White House would have to act through channels. We're talking ransom. Four billion bucks in war reparations to Vietnam to get the others back. That's billion, Colonel. With a "B". For a few guys that've had their brains in a blender for ten years? A pain in the ass to everybody? No way. There's no way.The colonel has let the pistol drop, until it is dangling,forgotten. TRAUTMAN So there never was a Phase Two rescue team? KIRKHILL Of course not. You can't get approval to rescue a kitten from a tree after Tehran.After a long silence, Trautman nods. TRAUTMAN I understand.Kirkhill relaxes. It's going to be okay. The colonel isone of the boys. KIRKHILL Here. Drink.Trautman doesn't take the glass. TRAUTMAN (reasonably) I understand your position.

His tone becomesself-righteous. KIRKHILL You're out of your depth, Trautman. Way out. I'm acting correctly here. Not you. Not your gung-ho jungle ace. (pause) It's over. Walk away.

Where were you held? Hanoi? Son Tay? I apologize. I'm getting ahead. Sometimes I get too eager.
