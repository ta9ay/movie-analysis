We hear the sound of a radio with a lot of statics. Apparently, someone is scanning the channels. After we've heard different channels, the scanning stops on a channel with jazz music. With a loud sound, the credits stop, the black screen moves away to the right and is replaced by : FILM SET - BEDROOM - INTERIOR DAY (it is actually day-time, but the scene in the film being shot is supposed to take place during the night. So all the artificial lights make us believe it is night-time) We still hear the sound of the radio. We are on a film set, even though we don't know it yet. The way it is filmed makes us believe we are in a real bedroom. A bedroom, seen through a window. Nice, clean, elegantly furnished and very well lit. Large bed. On the other side of the room from the window, a young woman is seated in front of desk facing the wall. The young woman stands up, with a paper document in her hand. She is wearing thick hoses, large slippers and a man's white shirt, which hangs down to the middle of her thighs. She walks out of the bedroom, to the next room. The window opens, and the camera, which acts as the eyes of the intruder, looks around the room.       VOICE ON THE RADIO       We interrupt this program to bring you a special news       bulletin. The camera moves to the next room : FILM SET - DINING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY (NIGHT in the film) A dining-room with a large mantlepiece.
