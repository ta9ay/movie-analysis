EXT. PENNSYLVANIA STEEL MILL - LIGHT SNOW - DAYThe plant is massive, grime-streaked, squatting in the valleyunder five massive stacks, each one trailing a black ribbonacross the winter sky. Fires can be seen flickering throughthe windows and long flames weave and dance from the tops ofguyed metal flues. Steam rises in clouds from vents andchimneys and the sound of it all -- the hissing, theclanging, the rumbling, the shrieking -- comes faintly, mutedby the falling snow.In the foreground is a street -- COLUMBINE STREET -- whichinhabits the bottom of a narrow ravine and plunges directlydown the hillside, straight at the mill. Columbine is a sadlooking street, a grim-looking street, a street hanging on bythe skin of its teeth. Dilapidated stores hug the narrowsidewalks. Battered signs squeak in the wind. Sandwichedbetween the stores and scattered on twisting roads along thehillside are narrow Victorian houses. These houses, which runto three stories or more in height, all seem on the verge oftoppling over, and undoubtedly would, except that they areall connected one to another by a mad arrangement of utilitylines which cross and re-cross between them with occasionalaid from a leaning pole.MUSIC COMES UP -- dissonant, rather frightening music -- aswe watch a car come charging up through the slush onColumbine Street. As it nears CAMERA the car falters on theslippery grade and slides out of sight. A figure appears,huddled against the driving snow. The figure disappears ASCAMERA HOLDS ON THE STEEL MILL AT THE END OF THE EMPTYSTREET.MAIN TITLE COMES UP: THE DEER HUNTERINT. STEEL MILL - DAYA white-hot ingot shoots out of an ejecting mechanism andcomes ripping down a track. Another ingot follows it, andanother and another and another. The ingots are huge,trembling with heat, and they come on with a terrifyingrumble.CREDITS ROLLUNDER CREDITS we see STEELWORKERS catching the ingots withtongs and deftly swinging them into troughs. The STEELWORKERSwear leather aprons and are stripped to the waist. Warped inheat waves and glistening with sweat they seem like figuresin some hellish ballet. Since they all wear goggles it ishard to distinguish between them, but there are three, whoare young, who seem to work with particular grace. These areNICK, SAL and MERLE.CREDITS END. CAMERA CLOSES ON NICK, SAL AND MERLE. The noiseis deafening, the heat is unbelievable and the ingots come onwith murderous speed. Taking advantage of a slight pauseMERLE jabs NICK and they both make cuckold's horns at SAL.SAL blushes and waves them off with his hand. MERLE and NICKmake the horns again and now SAL puts both hands on his hips,gives a thin smile and studies the corner of the shed. MERLEand NICK begin laughing. SAL can't hold out and he startslaughing too, but now the ingots begin roaring down the trackagain and they all grab their tongs.INT.

CADILLAC NIGHTNICK'S head is sunk below the upper rim of the steeringwheel. One eye is entirely shut and the open one seems closeto death. Suddenly his head snaps up. He slams his foot downon the brake and the Cadillac fishtails, rubber screaming, toa jolting stop.EVERYONE in the car comes awake ten bleary eyes staring outthrough the windshield.There are deer in the road, fifteen or twenty of themstanding in the headlights.EXT. CADILLAC - NIGHTVINCE, ALBERT, NICK and JOHN pile out with their rifles.VINCE immediately slips and falls down. VINCE Get 'em! For Christ sake, get 'em! JOHN Who's got the ammo? ALBERT Ammo!

ALBERTbegins pounding on it. VINCE There, Albert! Hit it there!Pushing and shoving each other, VINCE, ALBERT and JOHN rusharound to the side of the car. As they pass along theembankment at the side of the road there is a soft sound,like a sigh, and all three of them simultaneously vanish.NICK, who has been watching, stares at the place where histhree friends disappeared. He takes a few steps forward,realizes what has happened and doubles up in the middle ofthe road, helpless with laughter. VINCE (CONT'D) (getting out of the car) Man, let's go hunting!...

He looks at NICK -- flat on his back,pounding his feet, howling -- and then he looks at the deer.The deer are still watching. If anything they have edgedcloser and their massed expression of polite curiosity throwsVINCE into a blind rage. VINCE Get out of here, damn you! Go home!... Scat!... Shoo!VINCE, whose rifle is fully loaded, slams a shell into thechamber and lets off a barrage of shots above the deer. VINCE (CONT'D) Bastards! Assholes! Get lost!EXT.

Whoever took my pants, I want 'em back!EXT. ROADSIDE AREA - DAWN - LATERShots are ringing out in the hills. NICK, ALBERT and JOHNstand by the roadside while VINCE and MERLE glare at eachother. VINCE is still in his tuxedo pants, is still wearinghis dress shoes and is draped in a gigantic red goose downvest that could only have come from ALBERT. MERLE's knapsacklies on the ground in front of him and we can see that itcontains a pair of Vibram-soled mountain boots. MERLE Sure I got boots. I got boots right here. VINCE Then lemme have 'em.

JOHN (crossing to Merle's knapsack) I mean let's get going before --MERLE -- who has remained completely calm throughout VINCE'stirade -- pumps a shell in the chamber of his rifle. JOHNfreezes in his tracks and stares at him, his face gone white. MERLE I said no.JOHN looks at ALBERT, who is right behind him, and they bothback away. VINCE, who is standing directly opposite MERLE,begins to tremble. His mouth comes open, closes and comesopen again. Urine begins trickling out from the bottom of hispants leg, staining the snow. Suddenly, NICK steps forward.He looks at MERLE, crosses to the knapsack, takes out theboots, walks over to VINCE and throws them on the road. NICK (gently, to Merle) Let's hunt.INT. BUSTED-DOWN OLD LOGGERS SHACK - NIGHTThe place is about nine-by-twelve. The floor is rotted out,boards are missing from the walls and the entire structure iscanted to the right.

Wet clothes,most of them bloody, hang from tie-boards and nails. Strungup on the end wall are two deer carcasses, one of them with aknife jammed in it where steaks have been cut out.Snow is blowing in -- dry, crystal bright. It swirls overeverything and settles on the sleeping figures on the floor.CAMERA DISCOVERS MERLE AND NICK. They are both in sleepingbags, lying on rusted bedsprings at either side of the brokendoor.

Thebodies lie helter-skelter -- headless, armless, legless, gutsspilled in the dirt. No one moves and there is absolutesilence except for the low buzz of flies.A V.C. LIEUTENANT steps into sight. He gives a brusquecommand and V.C. SOLDIERS step out of the jungle. TheLIEUTENANT bayonets a few of the fallen U.S. SOLDIERS --idly, without much interest -- and then cracks a joke as herubs his finger in the Americans' blood. The V.C. SOLDIERSlaugh, spear a few AMERICANS themselves and repeat the joke.There is a slight sound. The V.C. LIEUTENANT spins and givesa low command. Fifty feet away there are three grass huts.He signals his SOLDIERS to spread out and then he startstoward them.INT. GRASS HUT - DAYSouth Vietnamese VILLAGERS -- women, children, and a few oldmen -- sit huddled in the semi-darkness. The WOMEN hold theirhands over their BABIES' mouths. Flies buzz and there is alook of stark terror in their faces.EXT. DUSTY ROAD - DAYOne of the fallen AMERICANS moves. CAMERA CLOSES ON THESOLDIER. His face is in the dirt and flies are nuzzling at agash in his temple. The face is unshaven, frighteninglygaunt, but we recognize that it is MERLE.A WOMAN'S SCREAM comes from the direction of the huts. A shotrings out. MERLE pulls himself to his hands and knees andstands there, on all fours, like a dog.EXT. GRASS HUTS - DAYThe V.C. roust the VILLAGERS from their huts, smashing themin the back with rifle butts. One of the SOLDIERS emergesfrom a hut carrying two small BABIES upside-down by theirfeet. One of the WOMEN cries out. The SOLDIER gives her akick, swings one of her BABIES in the air and lets it go. TheBABY turns over and over against the blue sky. As the BABYcomes down ANOTHER SOLDIER catches it through the neck on theend of his bayonet.EXT. DUSTY ROAD - DAYMERLE strips a B.A.R. from one of his dead companions, slamsa fresh clip in it, jams two extras in his pants and startsfor the grass huts. His movements are slow, almost dreamlike,and his face is expressionless, like someone risen from thedead.EXT. GRASS HUTS DAYThe VILLAGERS -- about twenty of them -- have been formed ina line. As the SOLDIERS look on the V.C. LIEUTENANT walks upand down trying to extract information. The SPEARED BABY liesin the dust between the two groups. The SECOND BABY tries toplay with it. The SOLDIER who threw the dead baby in the airsquats nearby and yawns.EXT. GRASS HUTS - ANOTHER ANGLE - DAYMERLE approaches between the huts. He takes a quick lookaround the corner, finds the V.C. all bunched in a neatpackage and draws back.CAMERA CLOSES ON MERLE'S EYES. They are cold, dreamingthings, glittering blankly.EXT. GRASS HUTS - DAYMERLE spins out with the B.A.R. on full automatic. The V.C.SOLDIERS go down screaming, arms and necks thrown back, in athin mist of spraying blood.ABOVE THE CHATTER OF MERLE'S B.A.R.

GRASS HUTS - THE VILLAGERS - DAYThe VILLAGERS stand motionless, staring at the helicoptersand frozen with terror. They turn. They start to run. Andthen they disappear in a roaring wall of burning napalm.EXT. GRASS HUTS AFTER NAPALM ATTACK - DAYMERLE stands alone with his B.A.R. surrounded by clouds ofbillowing black smoke. There is no sound but the rush ofheated air and the faint crackle of flames. MERLE'S clothesare burning. Flames are licking up his trouser legs and ablob of napalm is burning fiercely on his helmet.In front of MERLE the SOLDIERS and the VILLAGERS lie in twocharred heaps. The BABIES lie between them. Both aremotionless now, like two roasted stones.An AMERICAN LIEUTENANT steps out from behind one of theburning huts. MERLE and the LIEUTENANT spin on each other andthen the LIEUTENANT lowers his carbine. LIEUTENANT What the hell are you doing here? MERLE (numb) Saving lives.MORE AMERICANS appear, some twenty of them, coming out of thetrees in a long line. Among them are NICK and SAL. LIEUTENANT Move it out, girls! Move it out!The LIEUTENANT heads down the line. NICK stares at MERLE. NICK Merle?... Jesus, Merle!MERLE turns and looks at NICK. There is no recognition. Heseems to be looking right through him.SAL comes up behind NICK. SAL Hey...! Hey, Merle!A shot rings out. The LIEUTENANT goes down and suddenly thewhole line of AMERICANS is caught in a murderous cross-fire.Grenades rain out of the trees. MERLE, NICK and SAL dive forcover.Out of the smoke V.C. SOLDIERS begin to appear, more and moreof them, swarming out of the jungle in scores.EXT. CLEARING IN THE JUNGLE - HEAVY RAIN - DAYWe are looking at the ground where three pits have been dugand fitted with bamboo gratings which are held down bystones. The ground is ankle-deep in running mud and the pitsare filled with water to within a foot of the bamboogratings. In each of the pits are about a half-dozen men --SOUTH VIETNAMESE and AMERICAN. Their hands grip the gratingsand their eyes are hollow. Other than an occasional groanthere is only the sound of the falling rain.A V.C. SOLDIER trudges out of the jungle. As he reaches thepits he notices the hands, curses and begins jumping up anddown on the bamboo gratings. The hands disappear. As soon asone comes back, the SOLDIER stomps on it, shrieking withlaughter. Then, almost as an afterthought, the SOLDIER pullsdown his pants and squats above the center grating.CAMERA TILTS SLOWLY UPWARD. We see the clearing in itstotality. It is a raw hole hacked out of the jungle andcontains only two structures. One is a large bamboo "tigercage" with a few leaves tied to its top. The other is a smallhut with a thatched roof. The walls of the hut are open andwe can see V.C. GUARDS moving about inside.A cry comes from the hut. There is the THUD of a rifle button flesh and the cry abruptly stops.INT. THATCHED HUT - DAYIn the middle of the hut is an American kitchen table with arose-patterned plastic top. At opposite ends of the table aretwo chairs. A SOUTH VIETNAMESE PRISONER sits in one of thechairs. In the other chair, facing him, is MERLE.The SOUTH VIETNAMESE has a welt on his head and one of thehalf-dozen V.C. GUARDS in the hut is screaming at him. In themiddle of the table, between the SOUTH VIETNAMESE and MERLE,is a single-action .45 caliber revolver with an Americaneagle carved on its ivory grip.MERLE sits quietly, waiting, but his eyes are working, takingin every detail of the scene. The V.C. GUARD gives the SOUTHVIETNAMESE a final cuff, takes up the revolver with adramatic flourish and loads one cartridge into the chamber.Immediately the OTHER GUARDS begin placing bets. The GUARDSare a ragged bunch -- wet, half-drunk on captured Budweiser,and it takes some time to straighten things out.MERLE looks off to his right:INT. THATCHED HUT - REVERSE ANGLE - DAYWe see more SOUTH VIETNAMESE and AMERICAN prisoners standingagainst the wall. Most of them have been badly beaten and allhave their elbows tied behind their backs. In among them,standing beside one another, are NICK and SAL. NICK looksgrey, like a skinny ghost. SAL is out of control, sobbingquietly.INT. THATCHED HUT - ORIGINAL ANGLE - DAYThe betting is now completed. The V.C. in charge waves the.45 around and calls for silence. Then, closing the cylindercontaining the single bullet, he points the revolver at theceiling and clicks through the empty chambers until therevolver goes off with a ROAR. Bits of thatch flutter downfrom the ceiling. The V.C. GUARDS shout enthusiastically andgrin.MERLE sits motionless. The SOUTH VIETNAMESE across the tablefrom him begins shaking uncontrollably.The V.C. in charge now reloads the revolver with onecartridge, snaps the cylinder shut, puts the gun on the tablebetween MERLE and the SOUTH VIETNAMESE and gives it a goodspin.The revolver slows and finally comes to a stop pointing atMERLE. MERLE stares at it for a long beat. Then he picks itup, spins the cylinder, cocks it, puts it to his temple andpulls the trigger. The hammer falls on an empty chamber witha loud CLICK.MERLE places the revolver back on the table and pushes ittoward the SOUTH VIETNAMESE. The SOUTH VIETNAMESE begins totremble again. Fumbling horribly he finally manages to getthe gun in his hand. He spins the cylinder, cocks the hammerand puts the gun to his temple. The gun weaves around.The SOUTH VIETNAMESE closes his eyes and pulls the trigger.There is a loud CLICK.MERLE takes the revolver again. He spins it, cocks it -- allin one smooth motion -- puts it to his temple and pulls thetrigger. There is another CLICK.MERLE pushes the gun back across the table. This time theSOUTH VIETNAMESE takes it up with sudden confidence. He spinsthe cylinder, cocks it, puts it to his temple and pulls onthe trigger.THERE IS A ROAR. THE PISTOL IS FLYING IN THE AIR AND THEN THEMAN'S HEAD, HALF-EXPLODED, CRASHES OVER ONTO THE KITCHENTABLE.MERLE doesn't even blink. The GUARDS begin hooting andlaughing, wiping pieces of brain from their clothes, andMERLE watches them, watches every gesture, every movement...like a cat.EXT. THATCHED HUT - LATER DAYA pile of bodies lie by the steps in the pouring rain. Thebodies are both SOUTH VIETNAMESE and AMERICAN. Their headsare all variously blown to pieces and SEVERAL HUGE RATS arealready feeding on them.INT. THATCHED HUT - TABLE AREA - DAYNICK is at the table now, opposite a SOUTH VIETNAMESE. Heholds the pistol by his chin, spins the cylinder. His face istwitching, dripping sweat and both he and his opponent areholding onto each other's eyes as if they had been at it fora long time.NICK raises the pistol to his temple, CLICKS OUT. The GUARDSmurmur. NICK pushes the pistol across the table.INT. THATCHED HUT - PRISONER END - DAYThere are no Americans left to play except SAL. The sobbinghas stopped but SAL is shaking and trembling and his eyeswander around in their sockets as if they been cut loose.MERLE, who lies on the floor nearby, is trying to talk toSAL. As he does so we hear the CLICKS coming from across theroom and the excited MURMURS of the GUARDS as their bettingchoice survives another round. MERLE You can do it, Sal. SAL No. No, no. MERLE Sal... listen to me, Sal! You have to do it. SAL I want to go home, Merle. MERLE You have to think about this, Sal. Listen to me, Sal! You have to think about this. SAL (tears again) This is horrible! MERLE Listen to me, Sal. If you don't do it they'll put you in the pit. If they put you in the pit, Sal, you're gonna die... Sal, do you understand? SAL (nods) Merle, I wanna go home!There is an EXPLOSION from the other end of the room. SAL'Seyes go wide and he lets out a whimpering SCREAM. The GUARDSopen a path and NICK appears. His knees won't support him andthe GUARD who is holding him throws him on the floor. MERLE Listen to me, Sal. Do it! You have to do it!The GUARD who delivered NICK jerks SAL to his feet and dragshim of f to the table.INT. THATCHED HUT - TABLE AREA - DAYSAL is thrown in the chair. A SOUTH VIETNAMESE is placedopposite him. The SOUTH VIETNAMESE is a kid, even youngerthan SAL, and he is trembling with terror. SAL Hey, listen, you can do it. (Sal nods, smiles) Believe me, you can do it. We can both do it. Then we go home, see? Then we go home!SAL looks down. The pistol is ending its spin and the muzzlecomes up pointing at the SOUTH VIETNAMESE. The SOUTHVIETNAMESE stares at the gun and tears begin to fill hiseyes. The GUARDS begin yelling at him, urging him on and thenSAL gives him a SMILE OF SUCH UNWAVERING FAITH that the SOUTHVIETNAMESE picks up the gun, fumbles the cylinder around,cocks it and puts it to his temple. For a moment SAL and theSOUTH VIETNAMESE look at each other. THE SOUTH VIETNAMESE ISTAKING HIS FAITH STRAIGHT OUT OF SAL'S EYES AND NOW SAL GIVESHIM ANOTHER ENCOURAGING NOD.The SOUTH VIETNAMESE BOY squeezes the trigger. THERE IS ANEXPLOSION AND HIS HEAD DISINTEGRATES WITH A ROAR.SAL sits motionless, his jaw hanging open and his face formedin an expression of terrible puzzlement. Then his face beginsto move, begins to twitch, as if the muscles were trying todiscover a frown. SAL looks around. He looks back again atthe place where his friend was sitting and he begins to cry.INT. TIGER CAGE - HEAVY RAIN - FOLLOWING DAYA half-dozen SOUTH VIETNAMESE sit huddled together in themuck on the uphill side. A seventh lies sprawled on his back,DEAD. The rain pours through the few leaves placed on theroof and splashes in great cascades in the middle of thefloor.On the downhill side are SAL, NICK and MERLE. SAL is in afetal position, gripping his knees and rocking himself backand forth. His eyes are vacant and his face is fixed in anexpression of horror, as if he were still watching the boy atthe table blow himself away. Beside SAL is NICK. NICK sitsslumped against the bamboo. One knee is raised and he ispicking at the threads of his trousers where they have tornat the knee.MERLE IS STANDING, GRIPPING THE BAMBOO WALLS OF THE CAGE ANDLOOKING OUT AT THE "PITS".EXT. THE PITS - MERLE'S POV - HEAVY RAIN - DAYThe pits are about twenty feet away. Running mud and watergurgle into them, coming out through shallow trenches on thedownhill side. There are fewer hands than the day before, farfewer. The nearest pit only has one pair and as MERLE watcheshe sees that these hands are struggling to keep their grip.SUDDENLY ONE OF THE HANDS SLIPS AWAY. THE HAND COMES BACK FORA MOMENT, THEN BOTH HANDS DISAPPEAR.INT. TIGER CAGE - HEAVY RAIN - DAYMERLE turns away from the "pits". He looks down at SAL, thenhe looks at NICK. His expression is one of exasperation, asif he had been having a long argument. MERLE I'm telling you, Nick, no one's going to come. NICK What are you, God? MERLE Listen, asshole, it's up to us! NICK They bombed last night, right? Didn't they bomb? If they bombed last night, they could bomb tonight. They could be up there right now! MERLE What are you, hoping? NICK What else?

MERLE (grabs him) Get off your ass, Nick. Get off your fucking ass and stand up!!! NICK (stands) Okay, okay! (he straightens his shoulders) Okay. Okay, you're right... What about Sal? MERLE Forget Sal. NICK What do you mean? MERLE I mean forget Sal... Sal can't take it, Nick. NICK Forget Sal? MERLE Forget Sal... Listen to me -- forget Sal!

GET IT THROUGH YOUR HEAD OR YOU AND ME ARE BOTH DEAD TOO!A shout comes from the thatched hut. The SOUTH VIETNAMESEwhip around in fright. MERLE and NICK turn.Through the bars of the "tiger cage" we see the V.C. GUARDScoming down from the thatched hut. The GUARDS are alldrinking beer again and the GUARD IN CHARGE is waving thepearl-handled revolver.NICK looks at MERLE. The sight has totally unnerved him. MERLE (CONT'D) (calm) We gotta play with more bullets. NICK We what? MERLE We gotta play with more bullets, Nick. It's the only way. NICK More bullets in the gun? MERLE (even) More bullets in the gun... The trouble is that still leaves one of us with his hands tied up, so that means we gotta play each other. NICK (numb) With more bullets?...

Just put that empty chamber in the gun!NICK looks down at the revolver and picks it up. He stares atMERLE for a moment. Then he spins the cylinder, cocks thehammer, Puts it to his head... and CLICKS into an emptychamber.The GUARDS let out expressions of disbelief. Those betting onNICK begin taunting those betting on MERLE.MERLE sits motionless, as if stunned, as if utterly defeated,his brow furrowed in a mighty frown.NICK pushes the revolver across the table. His face istwitching but he gives the gesture a certain flair, as ifthrowing back a challenge.MERLE stares at the revolver -- stares at it with anexpression of utter gloom. Then he reaches out, takes therevolver in his hand and pulls it toward him, as if he nolonger possessed the strength to pick it up. MERLE (CONT'D) (gloom) Who's for Merle? (he thumps his fist on the table) Is anyone for Merle???MERLE roams a glowering eve over the watching GUARDS, as ifsuddenly discovering himself among traitors. Slowly, hepushes himself to his feet. The gun is still on the table,still in his right hand, and as he gets up he lets his bodysag over it. MERLE (CONT'D) Who here is for Merle...?There is absolute silence now except for the drumming of therain. It is as if the war had disappeared, vanished. TheGUARDS stand motionless, hardly breathing, so captivated byMERLE'S performance that they suddenly resemble littlechildren. MERLE (CONT'D) Who... here... is for Merle...?MERLE begins his chant again. His voice is low, verydramatic, and the GUARD IN CHARGE joins right in. MERLE (CONT'D) (with GUARDS) MERLE IS MIGHTY! -- HA! MERLE IS STRONG! -- HA!

NICK is unconsciousand the effort that MERLE has expended to get him this farcan be measured in MERLE'S eves, which burn like dead coals.As MERLE approaches, traversing the bamboo grove along theside of a steep hill, we suddenly see SAL, stumbling alongbehind and attached to MERLE by a short rope.MERLE comes to a stop, unshoulders NICK and lays him on theground. As MERLE stands looking at NICK, gasping for breath,SAL hunches down and stares at the endless trunks of bamboowith an expression of pure terror. SAL Where are we going, Merle? Are we going home?There is a sound, so faint as to be almost imperceptible.MERLE throws himself on SAL, slamming one hand across hismouth and raising the other in case he has to silence NICK.For a moment there is nothing -- silence. The rain drones onand we can hear NICK'S breath, which comes in short, shallowrasps.The sound comes again and suddenly a PLATOON OF V.C. SOLDIERSappear, coming down through the trees. Their passage isalmost completely silent and they go by on both sides, movingdown the hill.CAMERA CLOSES SLOWLY ON MERLE'S FACE.

SAL Where are we going, Merle? Are we going home? MERLE (barely moving his lips) Right here.Another explosion lights the sky, this one much closer. Inthe flash we see that a red American car is stranded in themiddle of the road. There is another explosion and anotherflash. The car is dusty, spattered with mud, but otherwise itappears miraculously unharmed.NICK'S breath rattles in his throat. MERLE, who lies besideNICK, holding him, has closed his eyes. SAL, who is the onlyone who has seen the car, stares at it hard, and for a longtime, trying it out with one eye and then the other. SAL Merle?No answer. SAL (CONT'D) Merle?Still no answer. SAL goes over to MERLE and shakes him.Getting no response he crosses fearfully toward theautomobile. When he gets to within a foot of it, he reachesout and touches it. SAL (CONT'D) Merle. Merle, a car!As the flashes continue to light up the sky, SAL peers at thetires and begins kicking them. SAL (CONT'D) Hey! Hey, gee!SAL crosses to the window and looks in.

Now and then an ARMY CONVOY comes through, blastingthe REFUGEES into the ditch.MERLE sits alone on the embankment by the side of the road.NICK and SAL are gone and the area is littered with freshbandage packages and throw-away medical supplies. Suddenly ajeep pulls up with a two-star GENERAL in it. GENERAL Where's your unit, soldier?MERLE stares at the GENERAL -- blankly, withoutcomprehension. Finally, after a long moment, he gives aslight shrug. GENERAL (to his DRIVER) C'mon. We'll take him along.The GENERAL and the DRIVER get out and start up theembankment toward MERLE. GENERAL (CONT'D) Little R and R and you'll be standing tall again, son... Damn, this is steep! DRIVER Uh-oh. Sir.The GENERAL looks up at MERLE.

The hydraulic LIFTERS on the loading ramp shriekand whine...NICK reaches for the new paper marker on his neck and peersdown at it from the corner of his eye.

Hey, hey, the snow does snow...NICK takes out his wallet, opens it hurriedly to thePHOTOGRAPH OF LINDA and peers at it with a kind of ferociousdetermination, as if this link were the last, as if bystaring at it hard he could make it hold. NICK (CONT'D) (his voice thin, cracking) Hey, hey, the wind does blow. Hey, hey, the snow does snow --There is the sharp report of a pistol SHOT and then, as NICKspins, staring at a shuttered building, there is theunmistakable sound of APPLAUSE.NICK stares at the building for a long moment, then hecrosses toward it.EXT.

NICK See, I'm going home. ARMAND Ah yes. Of course. (smiles) To the girl who waits. NICK (gives him a look and sits) Yeah... Do you mind if I sit? ARMAND But of course! Please make yourself comfortable. Perhaps you would enjoy some fresh caviar, or une petite glace, or --? NICK (weary, shaking his head) No. None of that. ARMAND Unfortunately I must now go in, but I leave you my card. Naturellement I pay my players cash American. Just so you know.ARMAND disappears in the darkness. Then his VOICE comesagain. ARMAND (V.O.) (CONT'D) However, should you prefer German marks, or perhaps Swiss francs, this of course can be arranged. Everything can be arranged.ARMAND moves around the side of the building and the sound ofhis FOOTSTEPS fades away. The TWO BURLY MEN come lurchingwith another CORPSE. Laughter comes from inside the buildingand there is a glimpse of AN ELEGANTLY DRESSED WOMAN seatedat a cafe table. The BURLY MEN return to the door and shut ittight.

(stares at him) Why?For a moment MERLE doesn't answer. His eyes are pale, likefaded robin's eggs, and they seem to look through NICK, as ifto some landscape far beyond. MERLE I like it because it's simple.A BEAUTIFUL VIETNAMESE GIRL steps up and whispers somethingin MERLE's ear. MERLE (CONT'D) (stands) I have to go, Nick. We'll have a drink.MERLE and the VIETNAMESE GIRL move into the CROWD. NICK Merle...! Merle, wait!NICK starts after them. He can see them ahead, moving rapidlythrough a GROUP OF ARVN OFFICERS and WHORES. NICK (CONT'D) Merle!!!NICK sees he can never overtake them directly. He cuts aroundto the terrace.EXT.

NICK freezes, then heruns.EXT. RUBBER PLANTATION - ROULETTE THEATRE - NIGHTNICK appears at the back of the aisle between the bleachers.The CROWD is going wild, yelling and screaming. NICK pushesthrough a group of BETTORS and then stops. A look of stunnedrelief spreads over his features.On the stage a tall figure stands alone in the spotlight,head bowed in acknowledgement of the OVATION.NICK grins. He begins yelling and screaming along witheveryone else.On the stage the tall figure raises his head, pumps his fistsin the air and begins hooting maniacally.... WE NOW SEE, AS DOES NICK, THAT THE TALL FIGURE IN THESPOTLIGHT IS NOT MERLE AT ALL. IT IS MERLE'S OPPONENT.INT. V.F.W. POST - BASEMENT - DAYPipes crisscross the ceiling and there is the faint hiss ofleaking steam. Seated on a bench and all dressed-up in theiruniforms are FIVE OLD VETS. TWO VETS are on the nod. THEOTHER THREE -- rheumy-eyed and ancient -- give patientattention to the SIXTH VET who stands beside the boiler witha bugle, trying to play TAPS. VET 1 Up a little there... What would you say? VET 2 Up.The VET WITH THE BUGLE tries it again, flubs it, startsover...INT. V.F.W. POST - MAIN HALL - DAYThree tables have been set up in the middle of the floor. Thetables have been laid with white cloth and the OLDER WOMENare setting out fresh flowers and laying the places for afuneral breakfast. They work in silence, fussing over theplacement of each knife and fork.AS THE WOMEN WORK WE HEAR THE SOUND OF THE CHOIR SINGING ASTHE SERVICE PROGRESSES IN THE CHURCH. AT FIRST THE SOUND ISBARELY AUDIBLE, EASILY MATCHED BY THE FAINT NOTES OF THE VETWITH THE BUGLE IN THE BASEMENT BELOW.BUT NOW THE SOUND OF THE CHOIR GROWS -- A SOUND AS DEEP ASWATER, AS DARK AS NIGHT; A SOUND LIKE STONE.Gradually, one by one, the OLDER WOMEN stop fussing with thetable. They stand motionless, listening.EXT. GREEK ORTHODOX CHURCH - FRONT STEPS - DAYA HEARSE waits at the curb. The day is windless, cold andgrey Snow is drifting down and the gleaming vehicle emits aghostly cloud of white exhaust.THE SOUND OF THE CHOIR IS MUCH LOUDER, ASCENDING IN DARKTRIUMPH TO A SUDDEN, FINAL NOTE.In the ringing silence of the MUSIC'S END the doors to thechurch swing open. NICK, VINCE, ALBERT and JOHN appear withMERLE's flag-draped COFFIN. Followed by MOURNERS, they bearthe COFFIN slowly down the steps.EXT. CEMETERY - DAYSnow drifts down from a leaden sky as the MOURNERS standtogether on a steep hillside of tilted, weather-wornheadstones. The mill looms behind them, breathing roilingclouds of steam and uttering a dull concordia of clanks andgroans.EXT. CEMETERY - GRAVE SITE - DAYThe PRIEST completes his reading of the 23rd PSALM. TheMOURNERS join in the LORD'S PRAYER.CAMERA CLOSES ON NICK, VINCE, ALBERT, JOHN and SAL. They helpSAL to the side of the grave. It is awkward. The chair getsstuck and they have to carry it. THEY ALL pick up a handfulof dirt and then, following NICK's lead, they throw it in.NICK steps back from the grave, nods to the VETS. The VETScome to attention. The VET WITH THE BUGLE steps forward andtremblingly, but perfectly, PLAYS TAPS.INT. V.F.W. POST - MAIN HALL - DAYThe meal is over. The WOMEN are drinking coffee, the MEN aresmoking and putting down the beer. There is muted laughterand conversation.NICK sits at the head of one of the tables, flanked by LINDAand SAL. He looks stunned. His food is untouched, there aretears in his eyes and he hardly seems to know where he is. LINDA Eat something, Nick. Eat a piece of toast.NICK nods, picks up a piece of toast and then, forgetting allabout it, lays it absently on his plate.VINCE comes up behind NICK, looking somewhat officious in anew blue suit. VINCE You want to say a few words, Nick? I think you should. Like that would wind things up.NICK nods. VINCE raps on a glass. VINCE (CONT'D) Quiet!... Quiet!!!... Awright, everybody, Nick has a few words. NICK (very shaky) I just... would like to say a few words... about Merle. I guess Merle always wanted something... I don't know... better. That fucking guy, he saved my Life. He saved Sal's... What Merle liked, he liked things right... But then there wasn't any place for that... that he could find.Tears are streaming down NICK's face and he sits down,looking miserable. VINCE (hisses) John!

ALBERT stands up.Then EVERYONE stands up. THE END
