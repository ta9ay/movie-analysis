Immediately a chauffeur-driven limousine drives upand an expensive place of airplane luggage is handed out ofthis, and the passenger alighting from the back is seen tobe wearing black and white sport shoes which, as before, areall we see of him.

MAN'S VOICE (over scene)          Oh, excuse Me!CAMERA PULLS BACK AND UP to SHOW two young men seated in twoparlor car chairs. BRUN0 ANTHONY, the wearer of the sportshoes, is about twenty-five. He wears his expensive clotheswith the tweedy nonchalance of a young man who has alwayshad the best. The wearer of the brogues is a fine lookingbut, at the moment, a somewhat troubled young man. This isGUY HAINES. He, too, is in his middle twenties and is welldressed because he can now afford to be. He nods politely,acknowledging Bruno's apology, then turns away with thegesture implying he wants privacy.                      BRUNO              (smiling with sudden               recognition)          I beg your pardon, but aren't you          Guy Haines.Guy nods with a polite half smile. Being a well knowntournament tennis player, he has had this sort of experiencebefore.                      BRUNO              (snapping his finger)          Sure! I saw you blast Faraday right          off the court in South Orange last          season. What a backhand! Made the          semi-finals, didn't you?Guy acknowledges this with a modest nod and turns to hismagazine rolled up in is fist.                      BRUNO              (with open admiration)          I certainly admire people who do          things.              (smiling and               introducing himself)          I'm Bruno Anthony. Bruno. See Guy          looks up. Bruno indicates his gold          tie pin which bears his name in cut-          out letters. Guy looks at it with          the faintest expression of disdain.          I suppose you think it's corny. But          my mother gave it to me so of course          I wear it to please her.      Converted to PDF by www.screentalk.org                3.                      GUY              (patiently)(a faint               smile)          How do you do.                      BRUNO              (with an apologetic               grin)          I don't usually talk so much.   Go          Ahead and read.                        GUY              (wryly)          Thanks.Guy tries to read but is uneasily aware of Bruno's openappraisal.                      BRUNO          It must be pretty exciting to be so          important.                      GUY              (fidgeting slightly)          A tennis player isn't so important.                      BRUNO          People who do things are important.          I never seem to do anything.Not knowing how to answer this, Guy looks a littleembarrassed.                      BRUNO              (still insistent on               being friendly)          I suppose you're going to Southampton --          for the doubles.                      GUY              (politely)          You are a tennis fan.Bruno is inordinately pleased by this small tribute.                      BRUNO          Wish I could see you play.

I don't smoke much.                         BRUNO             I smoke too much.He fumbles for a match.          Guy brings out a lighter and handsit to Bruno.

And the pictures. She's very             beautiful, Senator Burton's daughter.                         GUY             You're quite a reader, Mr. Anthony.                         BRUNO             Yes, I am. Ask me anything, from             today's stock reports to Li'l Abner,             and I got the answer.

BRUNO              (contritely)          There I go again. Too friendly. I          meet someone I' like and open my yap          too wide. I'm sorry...At the appeal on Bruno's face, Guy slowly relents.                      GUY          That's all right. Forget it.    I          guess I'm pretty jumpy.Bruno smiles with and signals a waiter.                      BRUNO          There's a new cure for that.              (to waiter)          Scotch and plain water. A pair.          Double.              (to Guy with a chuckle)          Only kind of doubles I play.                      GUY          You'll have to drink both of them.                      BRUNO              (grinning)          And I can do it.              (moving in)          When's the wedding?                      GUY          What?                      BRUNO          The wedding. You and Anne Burton.              (a gesture of               explanation)          It was in the papers.                      GUY          It shouldn't have been.

I'd         like to tell you about it some time.         But right now I suppose divorce Is         still the simplest operation.The waiter has brought the drinks. Bruno slips the lighterinto hip pocket to free his hands for the bills which hegives to the waiter, waving away the change. He offers aglass to Guy. Guy takes it.                     GUY             (as if he needs it)         I guess I will.                     BRUNO             (happily)         This is wonderful -- having your         company all the way to New York.                     GUY             (forced to explain)         As a matter of fact, I'm not going         direct. I'm stopping off. At         Metcalf.                     BRUNO         Metcalf? What would anybody want to         go there for?                     GUY         It's my home town.                     BRUNO         Oh, I get it! A little talk with         your wife to about the divorce! I         suppose she was the girl next door.         Held her hand in high school and         before you knew it -- hooked!

BRUNO             (raises his glass)         Well, here's luck, Guy. Drink up --         then we'll have some lunch sent to         my compartment.

Bruno has been drinkingand his eyes are bright and feverish. An almost empty liquorbottle is near a couple of detective novels covered withgaudily Illustrated dust jackets. Bruno has in unlightedcigarette in his mouth. Guy's lighter is on the table.Bruno snaps it a couple of times, as though fascinated, lightshis cigarette and puts the lighter on the table again.                      BRUNO          Sure, I went to college. Three of          them. Every time they kicked me out          my father threw me back in.              (bitterly)          He finally gave up. He thinks I'm          awfully small fry, not worth the          bait.              (wistfully)          You my friend, Guy?                       GUY          Sure.   I'm your friend, Bruno.                      BRUNO              (a little woozy)          No, you're not, nobody thinks I'm          anything special. Only my mother.              (empties the bottle               into his glass)          My father hates me.Guy smiles this off as nonsense.                      GUY          You must be imagining things.                      BRUNO              (hitting the bottom               of the bottle for               the last drop)          And I hate him. He thinks   I ought          to catch the eight-five bus  every          morning, punch a timeclock  and work          my way up selling paint or  something.          Him -- with all his money!                      GUY              (amused by Bruno)          Well, what do you want to do?                      BRUNO          You mean before or after I kill him?Converted to PDF by www.screentalk.org     9.               GUY       (chuckling)   Before, of course.               BRUNO       (leaning forward        eagerly)   I want to do everything. I got a   theory you're supposed to do   everything before you die. Have you   ever driven a car, blindfolded, at a   hundred and fifty miles an hour?                 GUY   Not lately.               BRUNO   I did. I flew in a jet plans too.       (his hand traces a        swift streak through        the air, and he adds        sound effects)   Zzzzzzzp! Man, that's a thrill!   Almost blow the sawdust out of my   head. I'm going to make a reservation   on the first rocket to the moon...               GUY       (amused and curious)   What are you trying prove?               BRUNO   I'm not like you, Guy. You're lucky.   You're smart. Marrying the boss's   daughter is a nice short cut to a   career, isn't it?               GUY       (quickly)   Marrying the senator's daughter has   nothing to do with it. Can't a fellow   look past a tennis not without being   a goldbricker?               BRUNO   Take it easy, boy. I'm your friend,   remember? I'd do anything for you.               GUY       (humoring Bruno)   Sure, Bruno, sure.               (MORE)Converted to PDF by www.screentalk.org       10.

GUY    Miriam.                BRUNO    That's it. Miriam Joyce Haines.    Played around a lot, I suppose?                GUY    Let's not talk about it any more.                 BRUNO         (almost hopefully)    Maybe she'll make more trouble for    you.                GUY    I don't think so.                BRUNO    You mean you got enough on her to    get your divorce no matter what?                GUY    Let's change subject, Bruno, can't    we?                BRUNO    Okay, Guy. Want me to tell you one    of my ideas for murdering my father?                GUY        (indicating the         detective novels)    You've been reading too many of these.                BRUNO        (going right on)    You want to hear about the busted    light socket in the bathroom, or the    carbon monoxide in the garage?                GUY    No. I may be old fashioned, but I    thought murder was against the law.Converted to PDF by www.screentalk.org       11.                BRUNO    But not against the law of nature.    My theory is that everybody is a    potential murderer. Didn't you ever    want to kill somebody? Say one of    those useless fellows Miriam was    running around with?                GUY    You can't go around killing people    just because you think they're    useless.                BRUNO    Oh, what's a life or two? Some people    are bitter off dead, Guy. Take your --    wife and my father, for instance.    It reminds me of a wonderful idea    had once. I used to put myself to    sleep at night -- figuring it out.    Now, let's say you want to get rid    of your wife.                GUY    Why?                BRUNO    Let's say she refuses to give you a    divorce --        (raises a finger and         stops Guy's protest)    Let's say. You'd be afraid to kill    her because you'd get caught. And    what would trip you up? Motive.    Now here's the plan...                GUY    I'm afraid I haven't time to listen.                BRUNO        (ignoring the remark)    It's so simple, too. A couple of    fellows meet accidentally, like you    and me. No connection between them    at all. Never saw each other before.    Each of them has somebody he'd like    to get rid of, but he can't murder    the person he wants to get rid of.    He'll get caught. So they swap    murders.                GUY    Swap murders?     Converted to PDF by www.screentalk.org               12.                      BRUNO          Each fellow does the other fellow's          murder. Then there is nothing to          connect them. The one who had the          motive isn't there. Each fellow          murders a total stranger. Like you          do my murder and I do yours.                      GUY              (with relief)          We're coming into my station.                       BRUNO          For example, your wife, my father.          Criss-cross.

I didn't even know he'd given me the          slip until his 'phone kept ringing          for about half an hour. Nobody sleeps          that sound. So I got the janitor to          let me in. No Haines.                      HENNESSY              (to himself)          Wonder where he went?

ANTONY          Oh, now, Miss Burton, really! I          know Bruno's been in some very awkward          scrapes, but nothing so ridiculous          as a murder.

Don't          you see that just one word from him          would extricate Guy from this dreadful          situation?                       MRS. ANTONY               (lightly)          Oh, but Miss Burton, I'm sure this          thing must be some practical joke.          You know, Bruno sometimes goes too          far.               (girl to girl)          Of course I shouldn't be saying this          to an outsider, but sometimes he's          terribly irresponsible and gets into          all kinds of escapades.                      ANNE          But don't you understand, Mrs. Antony --          your son is responsible for a woman's          death.                      MRS.
