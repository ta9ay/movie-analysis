She is now dressed in something dark.She and the three children sit eating another mealin emptiness. She has changed from a joyous womanto a woman bereaved.INT. RESEARCH PLANT: ON ROSS - DAYThe industrial frontier. SPECIAL AGENT ROSS stepsinto frame, glancing (perhaps idly, a littleimpatiently) in this direction at some loudindustrial goings-on just beyond camera, thenreturns toward GROUP.The group includes CABLE and a YOUNGER FBI AGENTwith clipboard, to whom KLUTE is supplyingpreliminary data. KLUTE's manner is somewhatrumpled, awkward. KLUTE Klute. With a K. K - L - U - ROSS Are you with plant security, Sergeant? KLUTE (shakes head) Town Police. ROSS Then how are you involved? KLUTE (slowly) I know Tom Grunemann. ROSS (shortcutting again) You knew the subject Thomas Grunemann. How well? KLUTE We grew up together. Kids. ROSS Can you account for his disappearance in any way? KLUTE No. ROSS Did he recently appear to you agitated or depressed? (aside to younger Agent, recording) -- indicates no -- Did he voice to you grievance or discontent with his research work here? Indicates no. Moral or sexual problems or peculiarities? -- KLUTE No. ROSS Marital problems in general? Indicates possibly -- am I right Sergeant? KLUTE Everybody's got some, I guess. ROSS Did he ever mention specifically a girl or woman in New York? KLUTE No. ROSS Examine this letter please. (continues) We recovered that from the shredder -- the plant disposal and incinerator system. Grunemann apparently typed it Friday, before he left, decided not to send it, tossed it away. We've already contacted the New York Police; they think they know the girl in question.C.U. KLUTEKlute reads. We see a controlled incredulity andrevulsion. ROSS (CONT'D) He never mentioned this type thing to you? You didn't know he had these interests?INT. GRUNEMANN HOUSE: C.U. HOLLY - DAYHOLLY thrusts the letter back toward camera, towardKLUTE crying out - HOLLY My husband was not like that! My God, Klute. KLUTE It looks like he sent her quite a few of those Holly -- the girl -- she recalls six or seven letters like -- HOLLY (calmly) -- No. I mean sure a little rough stuff, but just what people usually -- No, I would've said we were pretty good.

RESEARCH PLANT: DIRECTOR'S OFFICE - DAYCAMERA pulls back inside window to Klute staringoutside, as if still pondering the fate of TomGrunemann. The group in the office includes ROSS(holding a report), TRASK, a New York detective,Cable, and the plant director, STREIGER. ROSS -- has disclosed no evidence of crime or criminal intent within the jurisdiction of this bureau, and since subject Thom -- CABLE (turns sharply, interrupts) It's been almost a year! Tom Grunemann's been missing for a year. And all the FBI has to offer is a report that must bore even you. ROSS (restraint) Well sir. STREIGER Are you closing the case? ROSS No sir, we don't state that. We're countin -- CABLE But you don't find it worth much effort. ROSS (injured dignity) Well Mr. Cable, you've got me here from the Bureau. You got Lieutenant Trask here from New York representing his department and I don't frankly consider -- STREIGER (moderating, suggesting) Why couldn't you ever find out anything from the girl? ROSS (refers the question) Trask -- TRASK (summarizes from notes) We first hold her under surveillance expectin your boy Grunemann to show up there. Didn't. Then we bagged -- we arrested her on a CP charge, convicted, two month's women's city prison, offer to reduce sentence, she cooperated. (counts) Four interrogations. She thought she remembered Grunemann -- from those letters from before, she made that connection -- but she hadn't seen him since and couldn't identify his photograph and she -- STREIGER Why not? TRASK Oh a good call girl, she'll turn six-seven hundred tricks a year. The faces get blurred. (resumes) And since then, recent months, she's reported several, you know, incidents: like breather calls, anonymous phone calls, also somebody maybe following her, watching her, things like that. So it's I guess you could say, conceivable Grunemann's still around there, just hangin around her, spooking her. But you know, that --He shakes his head, gestures doubtingly. Ross capsit. ROSS The subject got emotionallv disturbed; he just dropped out. There's thousands. STREIGER Inspector we understand your position; ours is a little different. We have an investment in Tom Grunemann. The Company has an investment, and we feel entitled to investigate for ourselves. ROSS Private investigation, you mean. Yes sir, of course you're entitled, and there's some very competent -- STREIGER Klute offered us his services; we've accepted.Pause. Ross and Trask look at Klute - more than abit startled - then at each other. Klute just looksuneasy. STREIGER (CONT'D) Klute knew Tom. He has a great many ideas about the case -- ROSS (sourly) Yes sir, we know he -- STREIGER We'd expect him to work in cooperation with you. He'd report to each of you and to our Company's New York office, to Pete -- Pete goes there on a regular schedule back and forth, and -- ROSS (tactfully) Mr. Streiger, speaking frankly -- we've appreciated the Sergeant's interest you know, all along. Here, locally. But New York, that's - well -- TRASK (to Klute, leniently) Ever done any missing person's work? ROSS Spent much time in the city? (to others) You see, I have to wonder -- speaking frankly; the Sergeant knows I'm only speaking frankly - CABLE You wonder why we thought of Klute? Frankly? He's interested.INT/EXT.

BASEMENT STORE - DAYIt had once been a Boutique that sold happyclothes. There are some psychedelic posters and afew remnants of its former identity. Klute'ssuitcase is propped open on a cot behind a counter.The ceilings are low, forcing Klute to stoop as heenters. He seems out of place and out of scale. Acase containing a tape recorder stands on thefloor. On the table are a FOLDER of Klute's notes,and a paper bag. Klute enters and deliberatelyresumes his settling in.

WOMEN'S PRISON ROOF - CAGED IN RECREATION AREASPANGLER, a prison psychiatrist, sits on a bencheating a sandwich partially wrapped in wax paperand sipping from a carton of milk. He is obviouslya man pressed for time. KLUTE sits beside him.Across from them some prisoners are taking theirexercise. Through the metallic netting thatsurrounds them, we see the skyline of New YorkCity. It only dramatizes more the sense of beingcaged. SPANGLER -- Usual case history -- this isn't a medical confidence, it's all of them -- broken family, lonely, confused, crummy childhood, early promiscuity, formal prostitution beginning in her teens, income twenty-five to thirty thousand a year. (notes Klute's reaction) Oh they don't keep the money: they get rid of it, they get pimps. Why? (stabs at record) Why do you want to know all this? KLUTE I want to know how Tom Grunemann got mixed up in it. SPANGLER Not unusual. KLUTE Did she talk about him to you? SPANGLER About his letters -- that's all she remembered. Quite violent material, I'd say, obsessive, a quite sick man. But that's not unusual either. KLUTE Has she talked with you since prison? SPANGLER No. She had every good intention of it -- coming to me as a private patient, getting out of the life, devoting herself to an acting career. KLUTE I think she's trying that. SPANGLER Oh sure they try. The idea of a better life. But they don't really know much about life: They get confused -- or scared or frustrated or bored -- they pop back to the one thing they can handle. The trick. The trick. Men in bed. Not men in general, not life, not love, not even real sex -- it avoids all that. Just the trick, the transaction.INT. PENN STATION - DAYPOV world revolving around BREE through windshieldof car.

Klute puts photoaside, prepares to take notes, as she pleads -- BREE (CONT'D) Look -- please -- will you just try to get it from my side? A year ago. I was in the life fulltime. I was living on Park with leather furniture and a million dresses. Then they dropped on me, the fuzz, they caged me -- they started asking me about a man, some man, I'm supposed to have seen a year before that. Two years ago, two. He could be in Yemen!She waits for Klute to respond -- he doodlespermissively on his pad of paper -- she goes on. BREE (CONT'D) A name. Grunemann. Nothing. And they showed me pictures like this and they meant nothing. Then they asked me, well had I been getting letters, from someone out there in Cabbageville -- KLUTE -- Tuscarora -- BREE All right, yes, I had been. Those sick, wild letters -- I'm watching you, gonna follow you, gonna punish you, kill you et cetera. Well, they said, all right that's Grunemann. So try to remember when you and he - when -- well I don't know, there was that dumper once, he sounded like that dumper -- (explains) Dumpers; they get their kicks beating you up.

Usually it's a fakeout, you probably know. They pretend to tie you up, and you wear a dress with a cloth belt and they pretend to whip you or you -- (beat) Hell it's their money. I'll hang from the shower rod and whistle Maytime. Except this guy was really tripped out on it; he -- KLUTE But you can't say that Dumper was Tom Grunemann.

Up to now she's beenreasonably on top of things. Starting now we seeher driven toward the things she'd really rathernot talk about -- and increasingly more shaken. KLUTE (CONT'D) (prompts) Everything that's happened since Tom Grunemann disappeared. The phone calls and the -- BREE Just phone calls, right? They ring, you answer, they don't say anything, just blank. Kids getting kicks. Burglars looking for an empty apartment. I mean there is nothing that proves -- KLUTE What about the other things you've reported? -- (consulting notes) -- being followed on the -- BREE (interrupts -- awkwardly) Look -- I'm sorry -- I've led everybody wrong. I mean yes, I get those feelings, but that's just me, that's just feelings. (beat) I'm sure this will amuse you; I'm scared of the dark. And sometimes I get shook up, I hear people or -- well, I'll come out in the morning and think someone's been prying at my mailbox, or there's a little -- trash outside my door and I wonder if someone left it there for -- do you see? -- things other people wouldn't even notice.

Ilia trying to get away from all that. KLUTE What about the old gentleman the other night, Mr. Faber?She freezes again, looking at him. Then savagely -- BREE You saw that, goddamn you? You saw it?

KLUTE Tell me about Frank Ligourin. BREE (casual, pleasant) Mm? Oh, he was my old man. We broke up.She wanders away toward a bureau. Her shirt seemsto itch her; she scratches her ribs. Then opensdrawer, takes out a different shirt as -- KLUTE When?

BREE What? This? KLUTE -- OK? BREE (ingenuously) I thought you could trick me for those tapes. Don't you get lonely in that little green room? Or let me get you someone; I have terrific friends, wild. KLUTE No thanks.At this point -- or about this point -- Klute takesnote of something. A little above her.

KLUTE (CONT'D) Easy -- pretend you're looking here- (more insistently) -- here.She manages to take hold of a corner of the notes,trembling. He goes on -- KLUTE (CONT'D) Now I'm going to walk around -- you just keep talking, straight through, straight through.He strolls away from her. His destination is thearea of the door -- out of view from the skylight --from where he can head for the roof. But he doesn'thead that way directly -- first takes a turn inanother direction, his bearing casual. Prompting -- KLUTE (CONT'D) Tell me about acting -- what are you doing tomorrow -- where do you go?

BREE Gil?The pimp looks distrustfully at Klute who reassures-- KLUTE I'm not looking for her personally - someone she might know about. PIMP (shrugs; to Bree) Try Janie Dale.INT. JANIE DALE'S PENTHOUSEIt is a very small penthouse. KLUTE & BREE stand inthe small living room waiting for JANIE DALE. Thereare two very casually dressed prostitutes sittingaround the living room. One sits at an uprightpiano playing of all things STRANGERS IN THE NIGHT.Another one sits on a couch talking to a WallStreet Broker who is spending his lunch hour. KLUTEfinds himself staring down into a pile ofpornography magazines on the coffee table. BREE isamused at his discomfort.JANIE DALE, the madame, who has been on the phonein the back, puts the receiver down and crosses tothe girl on the couch. JANIE looks and talks a bitlike Lauren Bacall. JANIE DALE (to girl on couch) It's old Mr. Clean from Cleveland. He wants to know when he can fly in and clean up the apartment and see you. I told him I have all the cleaning equipment and that he can come anytime, but it's up to you.GIRL on couch rises. GIRL You know he wants us to be dominant. JANIE DALE Tell him that he'd better have his ass in here by one o'clock on Monday afternoon or you won't let him clean the bathroom floor, and tell him the price has gone up twenty bucks -- Old Dutcn Cleanser's not as cheap as it used to be.She shrugs and turns to KLUTE & BREE. JANIE DALE (CONT'D) You wanted to know about Arlyn, honey? I had to let her go dear. Arlyn stopped being reliable. (explains to Klute) I deal with a high type client, business people, you understand? I can't send them someone that's all the time half zonked out. KLUTE Do you know where she went? JANIE DALE Try Momma Reese.THIS IS A CHEAPER APARTIENT THAN JANIE DALE'SThe girls look cheaper, and the customers, ratherthan Wall Street lawyers and brokers, look morelike out of town salesmen who stay at local motorinns.MOMMA REESE is older than JANIE DALE, heavier andwith no pretense at chic. She indicates that shehas not seen ARLYN in some time. MOMMA REESE Try Bill Azure. If you can find him.INT. EIGHT AVENUE BAR - ABOUT 4 IN THE MORNINGThis is a hangout where black and white pimps waitto meet their whores after their night of streetwalking. This streetwalker world is far removedfrom the world of the call girl or the world ofJanie Dale. CAMERA pans past a group of pimps atthe bar taking bet on whose girls have made themost money that night. CAMERA then goes on toreveal KLUTE talking to another pimp (Azure). Azurerepresents a clear step down from Frank Ligourin. We catch only part of their dialogue. AZURE -- a couple weeks then she'd drift off a couple of weeks, you know what I mean? KLUTE Have you heard from her recently? AZURE She liked me all right but she had what she liked better, you know what I mean?We START FADE SOUND as Klute repeats -- KLUTE Have you heard from her recently?-- and CUT TO --INT. LINGERIE SHOP: PROPRIETRESS, BREE, KLUTE PROPRIETRESS -- She'd come in and I'd let her have something. Why not; she'd been a good customer, a beautiful person, a beautiful beautiful person.Again we fade sound a little before picture, thenCUT TO --EXT. OUTSIDE ADULT MOVIE THEATER: KLUTE,STREETWALKERS - DAY OR NIGHTOutside Theatre or Bookstore - Peepshow; an 8thAvenue establishment. SILENT ACTION this (or VOICESUNDER). Klute confers with one girl who summons andconsults another. They seem to know of Arlyn --haven't seen her recently -- refer him elsewhere --EXT. APARTMENT HOUSE: MRS. VASEK, KLUTE - DAYA shabby place in a shabby neighborhood. Mrs.Vasek, the landlady, shifts barrels at the sametime that she barks at Klute, in heavy accent. MRS. VASEK The whore, yeah. I threw out. KLUTE Do you know where she went from here? MRS. VASEK Live like animals. Her and the man. Out. KLUTE (reacts) Was she living with a man?We see Klute persisting - DISSOLVEEXT. WIDE SHOT: SLUM STREET - DAYWe still HOLD WIDE to establish the scene. This isa genuine slum. We see Bree, Klute move alongstreet. We see Bree drop back a little, Klutewaiting for her to catch up.EXT. STREET: BREE, KLUTE KLUTE What's the matter? BREE (glances about) What the hell do you think's the matter. (then suggests) I could wait for you someplace. KLUTE If Arlyn Page is living with Tom Grunemann -- BREE (eagerly) -- Then you don't need me. KLUTE But if it's someone else I do.He starts on, simply assuming that she'll follow.(There is a degree of acquaintanceship in theirmanners now - a reluctant collaboration.) BREE You sure pull a lot of mileage out of a hundred dollars.-- and follows on. He checks numbers, then crossesstreet diagonally toward a half-framed house.INT. NEWARK HOUSE - DAYA downshot from second floor level toward the entryway where KLUTE & BREE appear. KLUTE strikes amatch to inspect the names of tenants. He and Breeclimb through stench and litter to the second floor-- a door. From somewhere near at hand come thesounds of someone RETCHING. A square of wood hasbeen sawed out of the door itself, removing handleand lock -- light sifts through. Klute hesitates,decides against knocking, pushes in.INT. ARLYN'S APARTMENT - DAYThe retching sounds are coming from the connectingroom. No one visible here. A very few barren piecesof furniture. We hear ARLYN'S VOICE ask from thenext room -- ARLYN (O.S.) Cappy?ARLYN enters rather eagerly. She sees Klute first,then Bree -- recognizes her -- retires flat againsta wall, holding one palm outwards to shield herface. She is unbelievably gaunt. Inside one elbow,looking rather like a birthmark, we see a laceworkof purple where her veins have pulped together. BREE Arlyn? Honey? (then) Look, it's all right.From the connecting room a MAN'S VOICE (Berger's)calling out hoarsely. BERGER (O.S.) Is it Cappy? Cappy? -- BREE Arlyn, it's all right.BERGER hastens, stumbles, into the doorframecarrying a CAR-RADIO with wires dangling, speaksbefore he sees them. BERGER Cappy, I got a radio!He stops for an instant face-to-face with Klute.Then turns, plunges out of view again. Arlyn breaksafter. ARLYN No --We hear the MUMBLE and WHISPER of their voices fromthe connecting room (as she reassures him). Breelooks inquiringly at Klute (is that Grunemann?): heshakes his head. Pause, then ARLYN reenters,wrapping her fingers together timidly -- wantingthem out -- her only purpose. ARLYN (CONT'D) Bree -- honey - please, we're waiting for someone. BREE Arlyn, he just wanted to ask some questions -- something you could help us about. ARLYN Can't you see I'm strung out? (cries out) Please, we're waiting for it -- he's got to have it! KLUTE We'll go. Just something you could tell us, first.Arlyn seems to accept the bargain. He indicates toBree to proceed, stands away a little. Arlyn coversher elbow with one hand. Bree manages as best shecan. BREE Honey, a couple of years ago, with Jane and Frankie? -- Jane sent me a Dumper -- ARLYN Please, if he sees you, he won't come! BREE Arlyn, just tell me, did Jane have a dumper, one of her regular Johns? ARLYN What about him? Yes. BREE Did he come around often?Klute hands Grunemann's picture to Bree: Bree showsit to Arlyn. Arlyn inspects it, then uncertainly,weakly -- ARLYN No. He was an older man hon. The dumper was older. KLUTE Do you remember his name? What can you tell me about him?We hear FOOTSTEPS - UNDER, DIMLY - mounting thestairs. Bree notices them first, Klute persistingwith Arlyn -- BERGER (O.S.) (shouts desperately) Arlyn, get them out. ARLYN Please, I am begging you. KLUTE It's important. ARLYN That's not the Dumper, that's all! He was an older man! KLUTE Can you give me any more description than that?Arlyn catches the footsteps, dodges past him towardthe door, intending to reassure -- ARLYN Cappy? ---- as the pusher, CAPPY, steps in. All of this isvery quick, simultaneous, a confusion of voices.CAPPY takes one look at Klute -- ARLYN (CONT'D) It's all right, they're all right ---- turns and runs. BERGER (O.S.) Cappy? -- Cappy?Cappy's FOOTSTEPS race away down the stairs. BERGERplunges out from the connecting room, stillcarrying the car radio, shouting, pursuing -- BERGER (CONT'D) Cappy it's all right! I got a radio -- don't run, don't --We hear him STUMBLE AND FALL on the stairs outside,the sound of body reeling down. Arlyn shrieks andraces after: Klute and Bree follow.INT. HOUSE: LOWER HALL - DAYWe see BERGER lying at the foot of the stairs. AsArlyn clatters down toward him, Berger sways uponto his knees. His nose is bloodied, he cries.Arlyn casts herself on her knees beside him, pullshis face against her, croons to him, soothes andtends him. ARLYN Oh baby -- no it's all right -- oh my baby baby baby --Klute and Bree are only a half-step behind. Kluteoffers to assist: Arlyn puts him away ferociously. ARLYN (CONT'D) Get out! (to Berger, again) Don't cry my baby; I'll find him, I'll get it. Baby, baby, don't cry. (to Klute savagely, incoherently) Leave us alone! Get out and get out and leave us alone! (to Berger) My honey, my baby, my baby --We DISSOLVE TO --INT. SUBWAY TRAIN: REFLECTION IN WINDOW OF BREE ANDKLUTE SITTING SIDE BY SIDECAMERA moves in closer so we only see reflection ofBREE looking at herself and at the world seeming tospeed by at an inhuman pace as the lights of thetunnel zoom past her face. What she sees is thefigure of a woman with life screaming past her outof control.INT. SUBWAYSUBWAY slows to a stop and a door opens. BREE sitswith KLUTE staring at the open door and thenwithout warning - gets up and runs off the train.The door closes, leaving KLUTE locked in the train.SUBWAY EXITSHOT of BREE's feet rushing up the stairs indarkness and then quick cut to her face as she hitsthe sunlight. She pauses for a moment - relieved tobe out of the darkness.EXT. ROOFTOP OF BREE'S BROWNSTONE - NIGHTCAMERA pans from night view of New York City toKLUTE sitting on the rooftop alone as if trying tocomprehend all he has seen, the mystery of TOMGRUNEMANN's disappearance in this world and themysteries of the behavior of BREE.SKYLIGHT INTO BREE'S APARTMENT - NIGHTAlongside of him the skylight of BREE's apartmentlights up. He looks through the skylight and seesBREE enter her apartment. He can hear BREE talkingto somebody, and then he sees that she is talkingto FRANK LIGOURIN.KLUTE watches through the skylight and hears bitsand pieces of the scene between BREE and FRANK. Hesees the same kind of symbiosis, the same kind ofparody of loving that he saw between ARLYN &BERGER. As the scene becomes more intimate heleaves.INT. CABLE'S (CITY) OFFICE: ON KLUTE - DAYThe pristine, antiseptic, elegance off CABLE'Soffice is in its own way as unreal and dehumanizedas the sexual underworld KLUTE has been exploringwith BREE, and KLUTE looks as out of place in theone as he does in the other. TRASK sits besideKLUTE facing CABLE who is impeccably dressed. He isthe total image of the executive in control. CABLE She wouldn't be reliable anyhow -- a narcotics addict. KLUTE I believed her, Pete. TRASK He's right you know. Waiting for the pusher, she'd tell you anything. KLUTE I believed her: the Dumper was not Tom Grunemann. CABLE All right, suppose it wasn't Tom Grunemann; where does that get you? KLUTE (smiles ruefully) It's where it doesn't get me. I've got nothing left that connects to anything. CABLE Then, close the case. KLUTE I better keep looking. CABLE Where, how? KLUTE (the best he can offer) I could try Arlyn Page again. She saw much more of the Dumper than Bree Daniel. CABLE You just finished telling me she had nothing to offer. Not Tom, you said, the Dumper was clearly not Tom. KLUTE It's got to make sense some way.CABLE'S SECRETARY appears for a moment tapping herwatch significantly. SECRETARY Mr. Cable -- they are meeting in Mr. Camara's office. CABLE Yes Evvie, thanks. Gentlemen, I'm sorry.They rise, dismissed. He sorts a paper or two,continues to Klute. CABLE (CONT'D) I'm flying back out to Pennsylvania Friday; I'll fill them in on things. KLUTE How is it back there? CABLE I think you're homesick. (reflects) I'll be out at my camp over the weekend. Nice right now, that touch of fall in the air, that skim of frost in the early mornings, very peaceful. (briskly again) John, I'll be back here again Thursday; I'll be in touch. Lieutenant, thank you.KLUTE and TRASK depart.CABLE closes the door and returns to his desk. Hepulls out a tape recorder from a drawer in hisdesk, rewinds it and turns it on. We hear aplayback of the previous scene with KLUTE andTRASK. He stands at the window listening with somesatisfaction; as if listening to what KLUTErevealed keeps him in control of the situation.EXT. WINDOW - CABLE'S OFFICE - DAYThe CAMERA pulls back from a CU of CABLE standingat the window to a wide angle looking at CABLEthrough the window. The window is 30 or 40 storieshigh. The wide angle lens almost makes the buildinglook like it is standing on point, and CABLE, a mansuspended in space.EXT. WIDE SHOT: DOCKS - DAYA TUGBOAT has pulled in. The SOUND of its heavyENGINES, IDLING, runs underneath this entiresequence. A POLICE VEHICLE or two has parked at thehead of the dock. We see several figures on therear deck of the tug, but it's not clear at thisdistance what they're doing. The POLICE CAR WITHKLUTE arrives. He dismounts and proceeds from dockto tug-deck.EXT. TUGBOAT DECK: GROUP - DAYTRASK glances toward Klute as he arrives, butdoesn't greet him. His attention, like the others,is directed downward andoff-scene (to the surface of the water actually,just outboard of the tug). We see beside Trask TWOUniformed Cops (SUGARMAN and SPENCE) and DECKHANDS.And we hear, along with the throbbing of theengines, a stirring about of the water and apeculiar third noise -- rather commingled with theengines -- which we can't at first identify.Klute joins the group, watches.SPENCE brings into view, and shakes out, a giantneoprene body bag. INSTRUCTIONS among the group ADLIB, UNDER -- TRASK (toward Klute) They were bringing a freighter down through Kill Van Kull; propellers washed it up on top.SUGARMAN brings into view a METAL BASKET attachedwith short ropes. He complains -- SUGARMAN Why didn't you bring it up on deck? DECKHAND Would you bring it up on deck?They slip the basket downward, out of frame (intothe water). DECKHAND (CONT'D) (to other) Mickey, get something. Get the eels off. SPENCE (calmly) They'll drop off theirselves when she comes out.We CUT TO -BERGER - DAYWe see Berger sitting huddled against the tugboatcabin -- we haven't seen him before -- with hishands bunched in front of his mouth. We identifythe noise which may have puzzled us before -- hisSOBBING.DOWNSHOT: SURFAICE OF WATER, BASKET, BODYWe catch a fleeting glimpse of the body beinglifted, just before it breaks the surface of thewater.FAVORING KLUTEKlute looks on as EFFECTS trace the processing ofthe body. SPENCE kneels down out of frame to slidethe bag around it. TRASK kneels down to make abrief examination -- straightens again. To Klute -- TRASK It'll go to the Examiner. But I don't see nothin that means nothin.We MOVE WITH KLUTE as he turns and moves away a fewfeet along deck. Here he stands. Then SUGARMANmoves into view holding a clipboard. Routinely -- SUGARMAN You help us with ID? We can't get nothin from him.He indicates the direction of Berger. Kluteexamines the clipboard data. KLUTE Arlyn Page was probably an alias. She went by the names Terry Arlyn and June Price. She may have been from Pittsburgh, someone told me. I can give you a list of people who knew her, if that would help to -- SUGARMAN No point, thanks. KLUTE Is he claiming the body? SUGARMAN Uh uh, that'd mean funeral expenses.He spits, moves back in the direction of the group;Klute continues to stand. BERGER moves in hisdirection. Brokenly -- BERGER Man could you help me?Klute doesn't understand his purport, reactsinstantly, sympathetically -- KLUTE Yeah, what? BERGER You know, help me out. That's my baby there, dead. I got to get up.Klute stares at him -- a quiet horror -- as Bergerinsists -- BERGER (CONT'D) Man you don't know what that does to me, my baby dead -- KLUTE -- You've got to get up. BERGER Yeah.Klute shoves a bill in his hand, turns away verysharply, off the tugboat.EXT. DOCK: KLUTE - DAYKlute walks a longer distance this time, sits downon one of the pilings of the dock. Watching him wesee what might be a profound awe and grief at allthese things -- but is, in fact, a good deal more.EFFECTS, O.S. as Police Vehicles are loaded, drivenaway and as tug toots, runs up engines, puts outagain.TRASK moves into scene, sits on another piling,looks at him speculatively. Silence. Then -- TRASK That's how the other one died, you know. In the water. KLUTE (nods) I looked it up.Then -- (we are assuming a complete understandinghere between Klute and Trask, non-verbal. WhatTrask is asking, in effect, is: is this meaningful?Do we both suspect the same man?) TRASK Well? KLUTE Yeah.INT. BREE'S APARTMENT - DAYIt is late afternoon, but BREE is in her pajamascurled up in her bed. There are some magazinesscattered around the bed and the television set ison an old movie. There are cracker crumbs in thebed and a cup of coffee and an open jar of peanutbutter with the knife sticking out of the jar onthe floor by the bed. It would seem that BREE hasspent most of the day in bed. She looks like anunkempt child. The phone is ringing, but she doesnot answer it. The phone no sooner stops than thedoor bell rings. Reluctantly she gets out of bedand goes to the door. She looks through the spyhole and sees Klute's face. She undoes two locksand an obviously new chain and bolt and opens thedoor. BREE Well hello -- come on in.He barely enters the room. His manner is cool andremote. KLUTE I thought you ought to know, Arlyn Page is dead. BREE How? KLUTE The same as Jane McKenna. BREE (she betrays no reaction) Thanks for the jolly news. I thought maybe you'd left town by now. You kind of just disappeared. But you boys from Tuscarora have a habit of disappearing, don't you?Klute looks around the disorderly room. The plantsin the windowsill have never been in worse shape.They look as if she deliberately let them die ofthirst. KLUTE The next few weeks I would like to know where you are all the time. BREE (harshly) Why? KLUTE Just let me know when you are going out and where -- BREE What if i go out on tricks - you wanna come along? You could sit and read the National Geographic. KLUTE How can you do it to yourself? BREE (coolly) I don't get you. KLUTE Ligourin: How could you do it? BREE I told you before, you wouldn't understand. KLUTE You're right, I don't understand. Explain it to me. (pause) You were scared. Arlyn Page, that scared you. Well it should; that's death. So what did you do, you ran straight for it, death. Ligourin kills women. BREE No. KLUTE No, no you're right, I'm sorry. He uses women; he lets them kill themselves. Is that how you want it? BREE Arlyn was a junkie; I'm not on junk! KLUTE No, you can find some other way. (beat) Explain it to me. Bree, show me any sense to -- BREE (screams, incoherently) You get the Christ out! You dumb stupid bastard, you don't know anything, you square, you get out! I don't have to show you anything; you get out!Klute goes.INT. KLUTE'S APARTMENT - DAYThe empty apartment. He enters, switches a light on(dusk), tosses aside jacket, bookcase, etc., thensits down on the edge of his bed, with one footpropped up on it.FOOTSTEPS and A RAP at the door. He looks up, butdoesn't move, doesn't answer. BREE opens it,enters. There are tear-tracks down her face, butshe's no longer crying. She tries to smile, triesto explain her wants. Then with the unhurried,graven composure of absolute desperation, she sitson the edge of the bed. BREE If I asked you something, would you not laugh? -- asked you to look at something?She pushes up her sleeve, points at tiny spot onher arm - a freckle. He peers at it then at herpuzzledly. BREE (CONT'D) (apologetic) I thought it was maybe changing shape or something.Klute looks at it again. Judiciously --He shows her a spot or two on his own forearm. Shecompares, is reassured. Embarrassedly, she tries tosmile. It is unsuccessful. She gets up and movesabout. Her manner in general is totally unguarded,honest, undramatic, searching. BREE (CONT'D) Look -- I hate everybody; and I'm sorry for everybody; and I'm scared all the time.He only grunts. A sound like 'OK' or 'all right' --an invitation to leave. But she won't be drivenaway. More urgently, helplessly: BREE (CONT'D) Look, I don't know either. It's like the only thing I know how to do -- I feel safe.She's left the door a little ajar. He widens it forher. KLUTE It's been a full day.She pushes it out of his hand, pushes it shut. Alittle more angrily: BREE Please. KLUTE We did this before. BREE No. (then) Well all right. But you want to and I want you to and we both know it and all right. KLUTE (evenly, slowly) I don't like getting splashed.She accepts it decently. Tries to smile again,nods. BREE OK ----- OKShe gestures, tries to find something more to say,moves by degrees toward the door -- and wouldsucceed in leaving. But then: KLUTE --- Bree ---Standing still, she starts again to cry -- andbravely to keep the crying to herself. The childbereft. He contends with himself, then crosses toher, puts his arms around her, soothes her hair. Acompletely asexual gesture at this point, a givingof comfort. She clings, trembles, burrows. Then --a SERIES OF DISSOLVES: The street outside, atdifferent times of night interposed, with Bree andKlute at different times of love, As Follows:EXT. THE STREET - DAYThe street as we saw it just previously... stilldaylight... still somewhat populated, but drawingtoward dusk. DISSOLVE:INT. KLUTE'S APARTMENT: BPEE, KLUTE - NIGHTDarkness now, or close to dark; the room heavilyshadowed. Bree and Klute sit together on the bed.He still strokes her hair. He has pulled a blanketaround her shoulders. The transaction is still notovertly sexual, but the tenderness is more overt.He rubs his cheek against her forehead. She herselfis quieter, comforted. She begins to stir againsthim. DISSOLVE:EXT. THE STREET - NIGHTThe street at night. Eleven o'clock, let's say.Some lit windows; a single car moving past. DISSOLVE:EXT. THE STREET - NIGHTAll the windows dark this time. The deepest night,just before the sky begins to lighten. DISSOLVE:INT. KLUTE'S APARTMENT: BREE, KLUTE - NIGHTKlute is alseep -- more or less -- on his stomach.Bree beside him lies awake. She trails her fingersabout his back. A rather tentative, exploratorybusiness. Her expression is more wondering thananything else -- what does she have here, and canshe get used to it? DISSOLVE:EXT. THE STREET - DAY (DAWN)The street's first stirrings. From not far off, thesounds of trash cans being collected. DISSOLVE:INT. KLUTE'S APARTMENT: BREE, KLUTE - DAY (DAWN)Klute half sits up in bed. Bree is fast asleep withher head pillowed on his midsection. Some humor inthis shot: he wants to move but doesn't want towake her. At a point he risks it, reaches out forsomething beside the bed. Her eyes openimmediately. He puts his hand on her face, tryinggently to press her back. KLUTE Go back to sleep.But she takes his hand -- and retains it -- rollsonto her back. Still relaxed, but a little moreseparate, thoughtful -- a mixture of the Bree we'veseen before and the Bree we've glimpsed, thepossible Bree. She observes: BREE I'm still scared. (beat) I mean different but still. (frowns) Look, I made it very clear from the start, you're a yokel, you don't excite me, you don't even interest me, and so I only have one question which is what the hell are you doing in my bed? KLUTE My bed.She grins, then starts to reach for him, stillreceptive -- then feels another (and genuine) pang,turns her head away sharply. BREE Oh!He looks at her with concern, but only caressesher. She manages to explain -- BREE (CONT'D) I am scared. The things I do. The things I could do to you. KLUTE Mm. BREE No, not just 'mm'. You don't know what I --He settles himself beside her, makes overtures. Sheresponds, but: BREE (CONT'D) Oh boy, say, you think you're pretty good. KLUTE Yup.She pretends to bite -- they tussle -- she feels asuddenly growing excitement, seizes him. Fiercely,welcomingly, full out. BREE Oh --And we cut directly to:INT. SPANGLER'S OFFICE: BREE, SPANGLER - DAYBree standing, angry, antagonistic, demanding. In away -- a Bree-like way -- she's seized psychiatryby the throat. BREE The son of a bitch seduced me!She waits. Spangler says nothing. BREE (CONT'D) I know: it's ridiculous. But it's tearing me up and I don't know why. And look, all right, I came here didn't I? And if I have to, I'll keep coming here, the works, and talk about my mummy and my daddy and I'll even pay for it, but will you kindly for God's sakes say something? SPANGLER (smiles) I'd just be guessing. BREE Guess! SPANGLER Maybe this wasn't just a trick. Maybe you're in danger of real love, real involve -- BREE (primly, distintly) I do not love him. SPANGLER (undeterred, suggests) You've spent your life avoiding this. You'll try hard to deny it; you're quite likely to destroy it. WE CUT TO:EXT. THE PLAZA OF LINCOLN CENTERSunlight is beaming on the graceful fountains andelegant architecture.Groups of cheerful tourists are admiring thecivilized monuments to man's search for culture.CAMERA pans to ugly street across the way revealingKlute approaching and entering a dingy warehousetopped by an absurdly placed copy of the Statue ofLiberty. This is the municipal storehouse.INT. MUNICIPAL STOREHOUSE - DAYThe abrupt cut from the bright sunlight leaves usin almost total darkness as we follow KLUTE. We arein a huge storeroom. As we grow accustomed to thedarkness we see bits and pieces of incongruousobjects scattered along Klute's path - old piecesof furniture, lamps, piggy banks, etc. - theremnants of the lives of the plundered, thedestroyed and the dispossessed. Some is stolenproperty, some evidence for homicide cases, andsome the unclaimed possessions of the unclaimeddead.A CUSTODIAN -- an ancient retainer sort, a civilservant, leads KLUTE into an old elevator cage.INT. ELEVATORKlute and Custodian as elevator ascends; looking upthe elevator shaft through the open cage we see aseries of doors hanging over space seeming to leadnowhere. The whole sequence has the feeling of adream of being lost in a black limbo.Klute and Custodian leave elevator on higher floorand walk down the long very low corridor past rowsof locked vault doors. The Custodian stops at oneand opens it. We are in a small dungeon-like roomfilled with banks of files from floor to ceiling.The Custodian counts to himself -- CUSTODIAN Four -- five -- what number'd I say? KLUTE Four ninety-seven, Jane McKennaCustodian finds it, unlocks for Klute's inspection.Reaches for paper Klute's holding. CUSTODIAN -- And I keep the authorization, please. KLUTE I thought there'd be more.Klute pokes through a small collection of personaleffects -- perhaps an ankle bracelet, rabbits foot,faded snapshot of a child, some letters, pitifulremnants of Jane McKenna's life. Klute closes thedrawer, and the front of the drawer is markedMcKENNA, JANE?Over the visual material of Klute's trip throughthe warehouse we hear WILD TRACK VOICE OVER bitsand pieces of BREE talking with the psychiatrist. BREE (V.O.) All right. Loneliness. (space) Well -- separated. From other people. Forgotten. (space) Well, as if I can be here, I can go through the motions, right? But the truth is, I don't belong. SPANGLER (V.O.) (prompts mildly) Don't belong? BREE (V.O.) (snappishly) Do you always have to repeat? SPANGLER (V.O.) Sorry. (then) BREE (V.O.) Well it's more than loneliness. Hate. People hating me -- and watching me and following and waiting to hurt me -- you know? I'm all screwed up. SPANGLER (V.O.) You think people hate you. BREE (V.O.) The truth is I hate them: they must hate me. All right, the money. (pause) All right, not the money. A kind of put-on. It gets things back together. (pause) Well let's say I'd go to one of these cattle-calls, a tryout. I mean before -- before I got this job -- and they'd always say thank you very much and i'd feel, you know, brought down. They didn't want me. SPANGLER (V.O.) Didn't want you. BREE (V.O.) (snaps) I said that. (resumes) Well, so you have a choice. You can either feel lonely -- you know, the hate -- or -- (then more rapidly, plunging) So you take a call and go to a hotel room and there's some John you've never seen before, but he wants you. He must, he's paying for it. (beat) And usually they're nervous and that's all right, too, because you're not; you know this thing. And then for a while, boy, they really pay attention, you're all there is. (beat) And it's not real and you don't have to even like them -- you can even hate them, it's all right, it safe -- you know?INT. PROJECTION ROOM - MISSING PERSONS BUREAUOn the left a portion of the original obsceneletter. On the right a series of comparisondocuments -- beginning with a portion of a personalletter.

He does best with his middle fingers; you get fainter registration from outside keys like Q, A, L, P and like that. Next thing look around apostrophes, how he hits the space bar before --KLUTE & TRASK - STARING AT PROJECTIONS KLUTE But what reason could he have? What possible reason? TRASK Unless he was involved with Grunemann's disappearance. KLUTE I knew Tom never wrote that letter. TRASK What else do you know? KLUTE I never could believe that Tom was a split personality. I never believed he was a Dumper; and I don't believe he disappeared of his own volition; and I don't believe he's alive. TRASK We have some very tentative circumstantial evidence of freeky behavior, but there's no evidence of murder - there's not even a body. KLUTE I don't believe Tom's alive.As Klute talks he paces back and forth in thedarkness. He crosses in front of the lightedscreen; the letters projected on the screen rippleover his face. KLUTE (CONT'D) But why? Why?INT. MISSING PERSONS BUREAUKlute and Trask are seen entering from theProjection Room. In the background we see an oldblack woman sitting in front of the picture file ofunidentified dead, carefully studying each picture.In the foreground Klute sits down at a phone anddials. KLUTE Yes, Mr. Cable's office, please.CAMERA goes in close on Klute. CABLE'S VOICE (through telephone) John, how are you? KLUTE I'll be sending you on a report tonight. CABLE'S VOICE It's a beautiful day in Tuscarora - I don't envy you that humidity in the city. KLUTE It's not so bad.There is a silence. Both Klute and Cable seem to bewaiting for one or the other to make the next move. KLUTE (CONT'D) Would you like to know what's in it? The report. CABLE'S VOICE (obligingly) What's in it? KLUTE I think Tom Grunemann's dead. I've been a lot of places - I've asked a lot of people. I've found no proof he's around. I've found no proof he was ever around. CABLE VOICE How do you go from that to the idea Tom's dead? Suicide you're suggesting? He killed himself? KLUTE (plodding, unemphatic) He could've been murdered. CABLE'S VOICE I'm sure the FBI and the Police explored that possibility. KLUTE No. They never did, really. But that's what I'm going to recommend. The next step. Unless something -- CABLE'S VOICE Have you discussed this with them? KLUTE It's in the report. CABLE'S VOICE Do they have the report? Have you discussed it with them? KLUTE I wanted to give it to you first. CABLE'S VOICE All right. All right -- (then) John, just sit tight will you? I'll read your report, I'll discuss it with the others. I'll be back next Thursday, we'll talk the whole thing over then. Nothing til Thursday, all right? KLUTE All right. CABLE'S VOICE Thank you. Goodbye, John. KLUTE Goodbye, Pete.Klute hangs up. KLUTE (CONT'D) He was always at their house on holidays. Tom and Holly always had him, over on holidays. Tom felt sorry for him - his whole life was work. Tom felt sorry for him.The old black lady motions to Trask who crosses toher. She points to a picture in the file. She hasobviously found her missing person among thephotographs of the unidentified dead. She starts tostand but then sits again, obviously shaken.Klute crosses to her and gently helps her out ofthe chair. He sees in her face the same sense ofloss he feels for his friend.EXT. OUTDOOR MARKETS - EIGHT AVENUE - NIGHTKLUTE & BREEBree examining and feeling fruit in some imitationof a very shrewd and experienced housewife shopper.She is obviously enjoying her sense of domesticity,and Klute is amused by her enjoyment.OUTDOOR NURSERY - EIGHT AVENUE - NEXT TO MARKETThe nursery is an absurdly cheerful spot ofgreenery in the midst of the dirty chaos of theavenue.Klute and Bree wander through the plants. BREE I saw Mr. Faber. (beat) You remember Mr. Faber, don't you? KLUTE (controlledly) Yeah. BREE Is that all you have to say? KLUTE What am I supposed to say? BREE Well, I told him I wouldn't - uh - go there any more. (pause) I know it's tough to understand, but it wasn't easy. You see, he was nice to me. I mean, it wasn't just him. I got something out of it too I guess. Anyway, I told him I wouldn't go there anymore.She is like a child awaiting praise from herteacher. Klute says nothing. They continue walkingamong the plants and he picks up a few that she hadadmired. KLUTE Well, here's your gold star.Considering his contempt for all the dead plantlife he has seen in her apartment in the past, sheis pleased by this act of belief in her. BREE Spangler says we have a relationship. KLUTE What? BREE You and I -- a relationship. KLUTE I was wondering what that was. BREE (beat) Hell there's nothing so mysterious about the square life.EXT. BROWNSTONE ENTRYWAY - NIGHTBree, Klute approach unhurriedly along thesidewalk. She is holding his arm, HUMS to herself,enjoys the evening.INT. STAIRWALL - NIGHTWe follow them up.INT. ANGLE INTO BREE APARTMENT - NIGHTThe apartment is a shambles -- furnitureoverturned, decorations ripped from the wall,bedding scattered and ripped.INT. BREE APARTMENT - NIGHTKlute jettisons the grocery bags, thrusts himselfinside, looks quickly about, finds no one. Breefollows more slowly, whispering: BREE Oh Jesus. Oh Jesus. KLUTE Don't touch anything.He moves quickly to the rear of the apartment,looks at the rear window which has been brokeninward in a litter of glass -- then returns to thetable at the front of the apartment; his folders.Bree cracks wise, unsteadily. BREE You suppose he's a married fella?ANGLE TO TABLE; FOLDERSThe contents of the folders have been spilledacross the table and -- we ZOOM IN -- thephotographs of Tom Grunemann sorted out and rippedapart, Even the COMPANY PICNIC photograph has beenpainstakingly torn, specifically to destroy theimage of Grunemann in the front row.KLUTEHe stands, looking down, taking no notice as -- BREE He got in my clothing!Then a moment later, she cries out again, moresharply: BREE (CONT'D) Oh. Oh.He turns quickly. She is holding out, at armslength, a pair of her underpants. With a disgust soextreme she can only laugh. BREE (CONT'D) Oh look what he did in them. KLUTE Drop it.She doesn't respond. He seizes her arm, shakes thegarment back onto the floor. She starts to gag,slaps her hand over her mouth, starts for thebathroom. Klute yanks her back. KLUTE (CONT'D) Stay out of there.She twists free of his hands, backs away. The sameelementary terror we've seen before. KLUTE (CONT'D) Listen to me: It's all right. I've been expecting something. BREE (full out, vengefully) My God, I thought it was over. And here I am, daddy, right back at the start. KLUTE Bree -- BREE Right back at the start, right? KLUTE Go down in my room. BREE You said it was over, right? You said not to worry any more, all over, right?She's broken for the door; it's questionable thatshe's even heard him. He hasn't time to pursue --shouts again -- KLUTE Go down in my room and wait.Then he turns back into the apartment.INT. BREE'S APARTMENT - DAYA DOWNSHOT TO UNDERPANTS (as if from Klute's POV,connecting directly to the previous shot) -- then aFLASHBULB goes off and a hand and pair of tongsenter frame and flip the garment into a collectingbox and we widen to reveal that it's now daylightand the scene has been invaded by POLICETECHNICIANS. One is a photographer; another, afingerprint man, is spraying surfaces with a can offixative. In the foreground Klute and Trask aretalking with Ross, the FBI man. Ross is lookingthrough a dossier on Cable that Klute has compiled.Over the following conversation we show CLOSEUPS ofmaterial in the dossier. It contains photographs ofCable and his life from childhood to the present -including pictures of him with his mother andfather - she a very dominant looking lady and he avery passive looking man;also graduation pictures and pictures with hisformer wife taken when he was still a very youngman. They are the personal images of a life time. ROSS (to Klute) But if Cable killed Grunemann why would he get you hired to look for Grunemann? KLUTE Because he knew I couldn't leave the case alone. And this way at least he'd keep track of it. And me. ROSS What about Grunemann's letters to the girl, everything like that? TRASK Cable's letters, Cable's phone calls. Cable's everything else. He's been a Dumper a long time. He just passed off his own peculiar habits on the other man -- it kept things goin'. ROSS OK, pretend I believe you. Tell me how you get an indictment. TRASK Can't. Yet. Oh we got everythin' else: first rate evidence Cable typed those dumper letters to Bree Daniel. And Jane McKenna: Klute found a couple in her personal remains. We got dates of Cable's trips here coincidin' with phone calls to Bree Daniel, also the dates of death of McKenna and Page. We got some hints of his personal history. His father, unsuccessful salesman, committed suicide when he was 13. His mother pinned all her hopes on her son. He won a national science youth award at the age of eight. They had no money, but she hired special tutors for him in the summer time. She saw a good thing. He graduated from high school at 14 -- college at 16 -- no friends -- The kids in his class thought of him as a freak. He got his Ph.D. at 18 -- married at age 21 to his then employer's daughter. The marriage lasted 4 weeks. Her father had it annulled. She says he was impotent. World War II he got in bad trouble about a German girl, no details. We think we know why he killed Grunemann -- he found out Cable was a dumper; Cable couldn't take that. We think we know why he killed McKenna -- she wanted to blackmail him for it. All fine. But we got no body, no direct witnesses, we can't go any-damn-where. KLUTE That's the reason i told him we had no evidence Tom was still alive. We wanted to shake him into another phone call or another letter. It didn't work out just that way.The Technicians, meanwhile have packed to depart.The first Technician scoops the torn up photographsinto another collecting box. Trask retrieves thecompany outing photograph. TRASK Gov, want to leave me that one. How come he got to play with this one, anyway. KLUTE I left them here. I was doing some work here.Trask eyes Klute for a moment, as if a querying hisrelationship with Bree. Klute is clearlyunresponsive. Trask resumes. TRASK It's damn lucky you didn't have the dossier on Cable here. KLUTE Nobody's seen that. TRASK If we get anything from the lab, we'll have it by noon. And just think -- all he really had to do was write us a letter. ROSS Sounds to me you better shake him again. Put him in a spot he has to do something more -- but this time give him a time and a place to do it. KLUTE He called this morning from Tuscarora. Asked me to meet him at 3:00 at the downtown heliport. He's on his way to Chicago. TRASK He sure chalks up a lot of flight time.Klute starts gathering his papers we CUT TO --INT. STAIRWELL: BREE - DAYBree coming up the stairs meets the Technicianscoming down -- stands aside to let them pass --starts up again and comes face to face with Klute.On her part we see a wish to be reconciled -- ashyness mixed with defiance -- but Klute's manneris arduous. She smiles nervously, asks -- BREE Ah, Schmendrick -- what's the scam? KLUTE Those were police laboratory people, they've been over the apartment. BREE (mock delight) Oh zippidy-doo, they'll find my fingerprints. (then) Can I go in? I need some stuff.He nods; she starts by. Then -- KLUTE Where'd you spend last night? BREE With Trina. KLUTE I called Trina. BREE Maybe I wasn't there when you called. KLUTE Bree, what's actually happened? It wasn't that bad. BREE (cuts in harshly) How do you know how bad it was? KLUTE Why couldn't you stay here with me? BREE Because I didn't want to be touched! I didn't think you'd get that!Pause. Then, evenly -- KLUTE Trask wants to talk with you.She starts on, then turns back toward him -- ratherpleadingly -- BREE Hey -- look officer -- I can explain everything. It was just -- you know, everything all of a -- KLUTE Trask wants to talk with you.She continues on up; Klute continues down.INT. BREE'S APARTMENT - DAYEntering without greeting Trask (his manner is notuncivil but simply neutral, unreacting, Cop-like)she quickly gathers up a few properties, a changeof shoes. TRASK Miss Daniel, be sensible, you find another place till we get things cleaned up. BREE (brightly) Oh well that shouldn't take you more than another, oh, two and a half or three years, should it? TRASK A few more days. We know who did this. BREE So do I. TRASK No, not Grunemann. He's dead. The man that killed him -- also prob'ly Jane McKenna, also Arlyn Page.She spins around -- mute -- terrified. BREE (manages) Arlyn and Jane commited suicide. He said they commited suicide. TRASK Now there's a picture I'd like you to -- BREE You said someone killed them, you said you know who, you said that. TRASK Well we're pretty -- BREE Why isn't he locked up? TRASK We don't want to just lock him up; we want a conviction, we wanted him to do something more. BREE Is that why Klute didn't tell me? TRASK I guess he figured it was better. BREE What was better? I made better bait? TRASK No, that's not -- BREE Is that what he set me up for? Everything he's told me from the beginning? -- don't worry, don't -- TRASK (coldly) From the beginning I don't know why the hell he's messin with you. If he was me he'd know better. If he was even a city boy he'd know better. You're a whore Miss Daniel, that's the truth of it, right? Now somethin I'd like you to look at. BREE I don't have to look at anything. I don't have -- TRASK Here please.He coerces her to the table and unrolls the Companyouting picture. (We see the rip extending upthrough the image of Tom Grunemann in the frontrow.) BREE Oh no. TRASK Like for you to look for the man. BREE Grunemann? I've looked at him a --Trask has clamped his thumb over the torn image ofGrunemann, indicates with the other hand -- TRASK No. Not Grunemann. The Dumper. Just look around -- I said look for the Dumper.We see her comply -- her eyes moving over the rowsof faces. Then we see her stiffen, hear her gasp -- BREE Oh! ---- and WE CUT TO --INT. DOWNTOWN HELIPORT - DAYCable welcomes Klute. His outer manner is warm,voluble, congratulatory -- CABLE Sorry we had to meet here. But I'm pressed for time. KLUTE Well there's a couple -- CABLE I read your report. I had to go along with it -- the idea of this being a wild goose chase, Tom being nowhere around -- KLUTE Well as a matter of -- CABLE I've been up country, you know my summer place, my camp. I don't even have a telephone there. This morning they sent a messenger out, that you'd been trying to call me. KLUTE Yeah. CABLE I'm on my way to Chicago. Very important meeting tonight. Well -- any new developments? KLUTE Yeah, two things Pete, that -- CABLE You said Trask was arranging laboratory work. Police laboratory. Anything from that? KLUTE Yeah. It wasn't Tom. CABLE I'm sorry. I don't understand. KLUTE It wasn't Tom that broke in the room. CABLE It has to be Tom. You said he ripped up his own pictures, he -- KLUTE Not Tom. Whoever it was left a kind of souvenir, I told you, in her clothing. Semen. The laboratory got a blood group reading from that. The man was blood type 0; Tom was an AB. CABLE (slowly) Some mistake perhaps that -- KLUTE No. No mistake Pete. It doesn't prove who it was -- but proves it wasn't Tom. CABLE You must be discouraged. KLUTE (prosaically) Not too bad. This brings back that Dumper in the picture. CABLE That who? KLUTE Dumper, the man Bree Daniel mentioned and Arlyn Page knew and Jane McKenna knew. CABLE You said he was no possible connection with Tom. The Page girl told you that, not Tom. KLUTE Someone's been doing all these things. CABLE You were hired to look for Tom, not someone. KLUTE Pete, I've got a chance to buy Jane McKenna's black book. CABLE What? KLUTE Call-girls generally keep a book, you know, a list of their clients. Sometimes, if a girl retires, she'll even sell it worth good money. Jane McKenna had a black book; when she died it was stolen. I've been after it a long time. CABLE You were hired to look for Tom. KLUTE I'm meeting a man tomorrow night. He wants to meet me on East-River Drive -- he wants five hundred dollars for the book. Can you get that for me Pete?Sometime -- right along about now -- it privatelycomes to Cable that Klute may know everything andthat he, Cable, may be being trapped. CABLE I can't follow you. KLUTE Will the Company put up five hundred dollars to get Jane McKenna's list of clients? CABLE No. It's ridiculous. This has nothing to do with Tom Grunemann. KLUTE (shrugs, stolidly) It probably has the Dumper's name. It might give us some kind of new lead. (beat) I want a look at it anyhow. CABLE Klute, the Company's interest is Tom Grunemann. Solely and exclusively. You say you can't find Tom; all right, I'll see that you're paid off; the case is closed. KLUTE All right, but I'm going to see that list.HELICOPTER FLIGHT is announced over loud speakerand Cable and Klute walk onto field.EXT. HELICOPTER FIELDPeople are boarding helicopter. CABLE Why would they deal with you? You don't know these people.Klute is momentarily at a loss -- not a questionhe'd prepared for -- improvises. KLUTE No, but Bree does. She's negotiating for me. Bree Daniel.Cable takes an instant to compute the thing. Then -- CABLE I can talk it over; possibly I can get the money. When are you meeting the man? KLUTE Tomorrow evening, nine. East River Drive and 73rd Street. CABLE Suppose I meet you there a half hour before. KLUTE Just send me a money order. CABLE No, I'd -- like to be in on it.ATTENDANT comes over to motion Cable onto thehelicopter.Klute smiles awkwardly, raises his hand in agoodbye gesture. KLUTE Well -- CABLE Tomorrow. See you tomorrow night.INT. HELICOPTERCable sits down next to window. The helicopterbegins to rise. CAMERA goes into a medium closeshot of Cable against the helicopter window. Thehelicopter ascends in front of a very tall officebuilding made up of endless glass squares. Atelephoto lens brings the glass squares of thebuilding directly against Cable's head andshoulders giving us the feeling that Cable isalmost levitating by himself. As one floor afteranother disappears behind him we see an almostmanic exhultation in Cable's face; as if he is ontop of things once more.EXT. STREET OUTSIDE BROWNSTONE - DAYWe bring Klute along street, and into theBrownstone.INT. STAIRWELL - DAYKlute climbs the stairs to Bree's apartment --knocks. He waits. No answer. He calls once -- KLUTE Bree?No answer. He starts downstairs again -- then turnsback, unlocks the door himself, enters.INT. BREE'S APARTMENT - DAYThe room is still disordered. Bree and FrankLigourin look at him, silently. Bree has beenassembling armfuls of dresses to carry away withher. Frank sits nearby in a chair. Klute smiles alittle -- almost apologetically. KLUTE I'm always getting surprises.Bree doesn't answer. She sets the armload ofdresses over the back of a chair, moves aside toget others. Frank smiles cautiously, ruefully. Then-- KLUTE (CONT'D) I don't want you to do this.He still doesn't extract an answer. She returnswith other dresses. KLUTE (CONT'D) Please. I said I don't want you to do this. BREE (tight, small) Trask said I should move. Let's not make a thing of it.He continues to look at her; she continues togather possessions. Then trying to smile, to dealwith it casually -- BREE (CONT'D) Look, too much is going on here. I'm moving in with another girl, that's all. Just for a while. FRANK (helpfully) That's right. This other girl's got a very big apartment, big, plenty of room. (then) Look, it's not necessarily how it looks, right? It's --He thinks better of continuing. Klute looks fromhim back to Bree. He speaks gravely, spacing hiswords -- unable to speak any faster. KLUTE No. Please. Not with this son of a bitch.Frank rises, both nervous and offended -- butdealing with Klute as between civilized men.Smiling. FRANK Klute, let's handle it like grownups? I mean we're all grown up now, right? (ventures forward) -- we all respect each other, you know what I mean? -- I respect you, Bree respects you -- you could say, it just didn't work out between you and she. But you got to respect her too -- you know, her best interests, best for her --Klute hits him, pursues, recovers, and starts tobeat him. BLOOD thickly descends the side ofFrank's face, as he struggles away. Bree isscreaming. Bree grabs at him from behind. Hethrusts her off. But it allows Frank to break awaythrough the still-open door. Klute pursues.INT. LANDING AT DOOR - DAYFrank clatters down a stairs as Klute arrives inthe doorframe, and as Bree, behind Klute, screams -- BREE No!Klute is restrained -- restrains himself. Frank hasfaced around on the stairs, still bleedingextravagantly from his torn scalp. Earnestly -- FRANK Hey, I'm gonna get you dropped.Klute start's out after him -- Frank vaults awaydown the stairs -- we hear him stumbling andrunning -- Klute faces sharply around into theapartment.INT. BREE'S APARTMENT - DAYPAST KLUTE TO BREE. She is running away from himagain, to a corner of the apartment, fumbling at asewing basket. He starts in, after her. KLUTE (indistinctly) Please --TWO SHOTShe swings about as he overtakes her, holding apair of scissors -- simply and transcendentlyterrified. She strikes at him, slashing hisforearm. He and she stand in absolute silence. Helooks down at the stain of blood spreading throughthe fabric of his jacket sleeve. Then he turns outof the room and down the stairs.EXT. BREE'S BROWNSTONE - DAYKlute comes out of door -- goes down steps to hisown apartment. A passerby stops him for directionsand doesn't seem to notice the blood on his sleeve.Klute goes into his apartment.INT. BREE'S APARTMENT: BREE - DAYBree is in the middle of dialing the phone. Herhands are shaking; she misdials -- holds down thereceiver for a moment then starts again.INT. KLUTE'S APARTMENT: KLUTE - DAYKlute stands in silence for a moment or two -- thentakes rather more note of his forearm. (Noturgently but practically; it behooves him to stopbleeding.) He turns toward the bathroom, pullinghis jacket off with the other hand.INT. BREE'S APARTMENT: BREE - DAYBree speaks to the phone, trying to make a simplepoint, trying to keep her voice even. BREE -- until he gets back. (beat) Yes I heard you, I understand that. I said I'm going to come over, I'll wait until he gets back.She hangs up before the other party can object indetail -- takes up her purse and goes out, not evenclosing the door behind her.INT. KLUTE'S APARTMENT: BATHROOM: KLUTE - DAYKlute has knotted a hand-towel around his forearm,now uses teeth and fingers to pull the ends tight.Then -- intending to clean up -- he takes up awashcloth, reaches for the faucet --EXT. BREE'S BROWNSTONE - DAYBree comes out of door - goes down steps -hesitates in front of Klute's apartment strugglingwith the question of whether to knock. CAMERA pullsback to reveal we are watching her through thewindshield of a car in the parking lot across thestreet. CAMERA pulls back further to reveal theback of Cable's head as he sits in the car watchingher. Bree starts to knock on Klute's door but stopsherself and walks down the street. Cable's headmoves out of the shot. We hear the sound of the cardoor opening and closing. Through the windshield wesee Cable cross in front of the car and start tofollow Bree down the street.INT. KLUTE'S APARTMENT: BATHRO0M: KLUTE - DAYKlute finishes mopping up. SOUND OF TELEPHONE. Heturns back out of the bathroom and answers it. KLUTE Hello? (listens, then soberly - ) Trask, I don't get that.EXT. STREET: BREE - DAYBree is about a quarter block away from theBrownstone now, hurrying. She waves in thedirection of a cab, misses it, continues on. We CUTTO --EXT. STREET: CABLE - DAYCable stands looking after her, hesitates overchoice of action, decides to follow.EXT. STREET: FIGURES: PAST BREE TO CABLE - DAYWe establish the distance between them -- Cable 100or so feet behind her, unnoticed by her,maintaining about the same pace, not -- at thispoint -- trying to overtake (perhaps waiting forless populated surroundings) We CUT BACK TO --INT. KLUTE'S APARTMENT: KLUTE - DAYKlute continues his phone conversation, shortspoken. KLUTE Who told you, his secretary? (listens) Has someone checked his hotel? He always stays at the -- (then) I'll look around, I'll call you back.He hangs up. First he checks out the windows (but -if we want to be accurate - from mid room, withoutdirectly approaching the windows themselves). Thenhe secures a pistol from his jacket (and folds thejacket itself over his arm to conceal it, as amatter of public decorum), and goes on out.INT. STAIRWELL: KLUTE - DAYKlute's manner, over the next few minutes, exhibitsan absolute, untheatrical, care and competence. Aman -- Cable -- may in fact be hiding heresomewhere to kill him. He sets about checking thelikely places -- first of all the lower hallway,then the stairwell itself, moving steadilyunalarmedly up.At the top he notes -- but still without mainconcern that Bree's door is open. He calls ahead -- KLUTE Bree --INT. BREE'S APARTMENT: KLUTE - DAYHe enters, puzzles, starts checking around (quitethoroughly; she might be hiding from him). We CUTBACK TO --EXT. STREETS: BREE; FIGURE OF CABLE - DAYBree moves past CONSTRUCTION WORK, through one ofthose temporary pedestrian passageways. Behind her,nearer than before we see the FIGURE OF CABLE.INT. STAIRWELL - DAYKlute comes quickly back downstairs, back into hisroom, takes up the phone. Through the still-opendoor we watch him begin dialing -- then CUT TO --INT. SPANGLER'S (OUTER) OFFICE - DAYBree sits isolated on the waiting-room couch. Shemay have been here for fifteen minutes -- or anhour. She turns the pages of a magazine -- onehanded, without even lifting it from the coffeetable, with an absolute lack of interest, amechanical gesture.We hear FOOTSTEPS approaching directly toward wherewe are watching Bree sit. LELA (O.S.) Mrs. Daniel --WIDER - TWO SHOTBree looks up in a kind of frozen terror, as theSecretary smiles nicely -- lovingly down at her. LELA -- I have to close up now. Leave your name and number with his message service, Mrs. Daniel, and why don't you just go home and wait until he -- BREE No. LELA Well I have to close up now. BREE Look -- could I use your phone? LELA Yes indeed. BREE Look. I almost killed my -- I almost killed someone. LELA (the same tone, completely) Well I'm certain Doctor Spangler will want to talk with you; excuse me.Bree moves to the desk and telephone. But we movewith the Secretary as she moves into Spangler'sinner office and switches out the lights(establishing TIME CHANGE: dusk now) and as wehear, O.S., the sound of DIALING and BREE'S VOICE -- BREE (O.S.)

I'm just a little way across town --FABER, ON PHONE (OFFICE) FABER Yes - yes dear, yes -- maybe half an hour, sure, yes.He hangs up. An ancient stirring, a kind oftriumph. He glances about, then tightens his tie.Then it comes to him, after all -- he takes note ofhimself -- he leans forward against his desk andrubs his forehead with old bony fingers. We CUT TO -INT. KLUTE'S APARTMENT - DAY (NIGHT)KLUTE on phone. KLUTE Trina, will you call me if you hear from, her? Will you check other people she might call? Yeah, if it wasn't trouble I wouldn't ask vou.He hangs up, immediately starts to dial again, thenpauses to check a list he's laid out by thetelephone. While he's doing this, his PHONE RINGS. KLUTE (CONT'D) Yeah? (then) Nothing yet, Trask; I'm going down the list. I've tried Spangler's office and Spangler's home; I just get his message service. I'll keep-- (interrupted -- listens -- then -- grimly) I may have steered Cable that way. I told him Bree was dealing for me, for Jane McKenna's book. Have you found any --He is interrupted again -- Trask wasting no wordson his end of things -- nods once -- KLUTE (CONT'D) Yeah.-- and depresses the receiver just long enough toclear the connection, and starts dialing again --We CUT TO --INT. STAIRWAY OF GARMENT BUILDING - DAY (NIGHT)Quitting time. As Bree enters from street level,employees are coming down the stairs, pushing pasther. She continues up on until at one point -- onemore officious or more communicative than theothers informs her -- FOREMAN Lady, it's closing up there. BREE What? FOREMAN We're closing up, quitting time, Fabers. BREE (unsurely) I have an appointment with Mr. Faber. FOREMAN Oh, yeah.He lets her pass, glances after her like theothers, continues on his way.INT. GARMENT BUILDING: FABER RECEPTION AREA - DAY(NIGHT)Bree arrives at the head of the stairs -- as stillothers press past her on their way down -- andcomes more or less directly up against the thicksetRECEPTIONIST. She is packing her purse, preparingto depart, looks somewhat challengingly at Bree --who sees no way to avoid the issue. BREE I have an appointment with Mr. Faber. RECEPTIONIST In there. (turns, bawls) Mr. Faber --Bree goes on nervously in the direction indicated,toward --A CORNER OF OFFICES: NATHAN FABERNATHAN stands bending over a bench with back tocamera, conferring with another man as Breeapproaches -- looking to us, as to her, exactlylike his father. We hear the Receptionist's VOICErepeating -- RECEPTIONIST (CONT'D) (O.S.) (CONT'D) Mr. Faber --As Bree nears him, he straightens and turns -- amuch younger man. Bree stops short, recognizing theerror. NATHAN Yes? BREE I'm sorry -- Mr. Faber Senior.

Then --RECEPTION AREA: RECEPTIONIST, BREEBree returns toward Receptionist, awkwardly -- BREE Did Mr. Faber leave a message for me or anything? Mr. Faber Senior? Bree Daniel. RECEPTIONIST Oh, I thought that was for tomorrow.The Receptionist riffles through a stack ofassorted envelopes -- hands one out to Bree -- andpromptly takes her way off. Out. Bree starts toopen the envelope then and there -- but OTHERScontinue to move past her. She seeks a more privateplace.ROWS OF GARMENTSBree shelters herself out of sight from everyoneelse -- though we continue to hear INTERMITTENTVOICES, O.S. and continue to maintain the sense ofother presences.We see her open the envelope --CLOSER: BREE, ENVELOPEShe finds nothing inside but money -- billstotaling fifty dollars. We see her looking for amessage, finding nothing. It comes to her slowlythat she's been paid off and avoided. She bites herlips in pain. She pushes back out of hiding --RECEPTIONIST AREA-- back to the reception area again. (By now thisimmediate scene has emptied, though we catch sightof a figure or two at scene-start, moving throughthe background, and continue to hear an occasionalNOISE or VOICE O.S.)Bree looks about for someone -- then scouts for apencil, finds one in a desk (or bench) drawer,starts to readdress the envelope (to direct it backto Mr. Faber). Then she breaks off from that, takesup a PHONE instead, dials -- waits -- then -- BREE Bree Daniel. Has he called in yet? Well if he does, I'm at -- (reads phone) -- two seven eight, three one hundred, and I guess I can wait here five minutes; then I'll try from somewhere else. (impatiently) Just tell him Bree Daniel; he knows who.She hangs up, goes back to readdressing theenvelope. FOOTSTEPS are approaching in herdirection. She glances up apologetically. BREE (CONT'D) Mr. Faber, I just wanted to leave this for your father, and I wondered if you'd --She pauses --ANGLE PAST BREE TO CABLECable hastens toward her along a lane of garments.In this brief glimpse a ludicrous and terrifyingfigure -- a noise, a gesticulation (actually thegesture is arms out, palms downward, intended as aquieting gesture; and the hissing noise is intendedas a shushing). Bree cries out, turns to run -- BREE (CONT'D) Someone ---- as we immediately, even as she's turning, CUT TO--INT. KLUTE'S APARTMENT: KLUTE - DAY (NIGHT)Klute speaks quietly but with terrible urgency intothe phone (dealing evidently with an ethicallyskittish message service at the other end). KLUTE Did she leave a number? (beat) This is a police call; don't make me take time to prove it. Did she leave a number? What is the number? (beat) What is the number? --INT. GARMENT BUILDING - DAY (NIGHT)Cable and Bree. They are at some remove from thesite of Cable's first appearance; there are otherevidences of time-lapse. Cable's manner is that ofslightly-strained patience -- a civility -- anattempt now and then to smile. Bree watches hisevery slight gesture, quivers to make a break forit, tries throughout to buy time. CABLE Can't we talk together reasonably, just -- ordinarily? (beat) I know you're expecting some kind of -- extravagant behavior, but believe me -- do you believe me? -- BREE Yes -- all right -- CABLE -- We can talk -- BREE -- Yes. CABLE All right, then, an ordinary matter. I'm a quite well off man, I have a -- position to respect. I would feel personally uncomfortable to be connected with a -- certain kind of woman, I'm sure you understand. Do you? Well I'd like to buy Jane McKenna's book.He looks at her discerningly. She seems not to havefollowed his exposition. He tries patiently toclarify it. CABLE (CONT'D) Her black book, Jane McKenna's, her list of -- of persons. I was told you're negotiating for it on behalf of --The PHONE RINGS, an explosive noise. Bree startles.It has been put on night-ring, to sound all overthe loft, and the noise is deafening. But -- themost bizarre element is Cable's absolute lack ofresponse to it. It rings and rings as he talks andtalks -- in the same expository tone as before,without raising his voice. It drowns out most ofhis words -- at most we catch only odd phrases ofall the following -- but he seems not to hear itany more than the clamor of other things torturinghis soul. CABLE (CONT'D) That was what Klute told me -- you were negotiating for him to buy that list. And I'm in a position to pay a good deal more for it than he can. Do you understand? I'd like you to acquire it on my -- (beat) Miss Daniel, do you not understand? (beat) Miss Daniel, I can't tell whether you understand me. (beat - still reasonably) Is this something Klute just invented? Is this a trap for me, Miss Daniel; does Klute know about me?He turns and lifts a phone (one of the extensionphones situated around the loft) -- though up tonow he's given no evidence of even hearing theringing. He just stands holding the phone for atime, then lowers it back on the receiver. With asort of absolute quiet -- CABLE (CONT'D) You have no idea what I'm talking about. BREE Yes -- Jane McKenna's book -- I could make a phone call. CABLE No, you're frightened, you're pretending. Well -- Klute knows about me then. Does everybody know, can you tell me? BREE Yes. CABLE Then it doesn't matter what I do any more, does it?Pause. Then he shudders slightly. CABLE (CONT'D) You people know nothing about pain.We CUT TO --EXT. STREETS - DAY (NIGHT)We see Klute -- probably in MLS -- running alongstreet. He tries for a cab -- misses it -- haltsthe next by expedient of cutting bodily in front ofit. The Driver starts to lean out to object. Klutemashes him back inside, enters the cab. We CUT BACKTO --INT. GARMENT BUILDING - DAY (NIGHT)MLS, the two FIGURES: CABLE, BREE. They aresomewhat separated -- Cable has gone to look downfrom one of the arched windows of the loft, whileBree remains in place. She is a prisoner, we cansuppose -- when we cut closer we'll see her eyescontinually shifting, her mind calculating herchances -- but he hasn't molested her. He bears herno animus at this point. His manner is ratherquiet, undetermined. He feels some relief that thething is, in effect, over -- and some puzzlementabout what to do (with either her or himself) now.He returns toward her.CLOSER: BREE, CABLENearing her again, he gestures several times,apologetically, seeking words. CABLE I've got no idea what I shall do.He happens too close; she can't avoid shrinking. CABLE (CONT'D) I'm not going to hurt you, absolutely, I'm not. BREE Will you let me go then?He seems not to have heard the request. He sits fora moment. An intellectual interest, a curiosity.(Meanwhile, perhaps, we see her starting to slipher shoes off, in hopes of running.) CABLE It puzzles me so badly. I've done terrible things but I can't consider myself a terrible man. I've killed three people and I'd still want to say it was accident, do you see? BREE (tries again, slowly) If you'll let me go I could tell them what -- CABLE (unhearing, resumes) Tom Grunemann discovered me -- we were here on business together, he discovered me with Jane McKenna. Then I suppose it was the -- the contempt I saw in his face and the certainty that sooner or later he'd use it against me. Within the Company. I endured that as long as I could, do you see? BREE I'm sorry, I'm just frightened. Yes. CABLE Excuse me Miss Daniel? BREE I said yes, I see. CABLE (doubtingly) Oh no, I don't think -- BREE Tell me. I'll listen. (pause) I just want you to tell me.He rises, approaches her -- apparently taken in,credulous, grateful, wondering -- CABLE You're willing to listen? You want me just to keep talking?He hits her. CABLE (CONT'D) That's what you do, isn't it; you make a man feel accepted. That's what you all do. Your stock in trade a man's weakness.He hits her again. CABLE (CONT'D) Why don't you ask for mercy? My God, what mercy has anyone given me?INT. ELEVATOR - KLUTE ASCENDING - DAY (NIGHT)EXT.

GARMENT BUILDING: KLUTE - DAY (NIGHT)Klute goes downstairs to back entrance of Faberloft. He slips inside. He hears THE SOUNDS OF THEBEATING -- a stirring of feet and indistinct impactsounds, a murmur of voices (but all quite muted,undramatic). He maneuvers through lanes ofgarments, trying to gain a line of sight. Heunderstands what's going on, strains to intervene,but can't disclose himself. At a point, he drops tohands and knees, slides underneath the garmentracks, drawing closer to Cable, trying to gainposition. We intersperse his progress with furtherBree-Cable fragments, as for instance --FRAGMENT: CABLE, BREE CABLE You're a person of no value, you have no value --KLUTE, SHIFTING CLOSERKlute works his way steadily closer -- understeadily increasing pressure, as the pursuit andbeating continue as SOUNDS, O.S. Even close at handthe noises are ambiguous -- the clatter offootsteps, grunts, a slap of flesh -- rather thandistinct.

Then we CUT TO --INT. KLUTE'S APARTMENT - DAYKLUTE is packing to leave. We follow him about ashe carries clothing from closet and bureau, foldsit into his suitcase on the table. We hear thefamiliar FOOTSTEPS on the stairs. Bree's KNOCK. Helets her in, keeps on about his business. Hisexpression is sober; hers is quite tentative. BREE Hi.He doesn't at least expel her. She ventures in,sits on the table, swings her heels, watches himpack. His arm impairs him. At length -- KLUTE I got a call from Ross this morning. Cable owned a plot of woodland -- he'd go there on weekends. They found Tom Grunemann's body buried there. They've notified his wife. BREE Oh. (pause; then sharply --) Well it wasn't us city people that did it -- your fine rosy-cheeked country boy. KLUTE Mm. BREE You're going back? KLUTE Mm.Pause. She compresses her lips, slips down from thetable, starts smartly out of the room. KLUTE (CONT'D) Wait.She returns and sits on the table again, waits. ButKlute doesn't seem about to say anything more --goes on packing. BREE Well suppose I hadn't come downstairs. Would you just have folded up and sneaked away? KLUTE (slowly) No. I was going to come up. I wanted to ask you to marry me. (pause) BREE You wanted to, or you are? KLUTE I am. BREE You could at least look at me!He complies, stands and looks, folding a necktie.But now she finds she has to look away. Somewhatbrokenly -- BREE (CONT'D) Look -- yes. I mean thanks, but -- don't you think we better be realistic? KLUTE About what? BREE Look at me. I'm pretty and sort of clever and very well intentioned, and dear God I'd tear your heart out! KLUTE I don't think so.He resumes packing, continues through thefollowing. BREE How can you not think so? You know the things I can do. KLUTE (unclearly) They don't scare me any more. BREE What? KLUTE Doesn't scare me. I think we could handle it.Thereafter he guards his silence, staunchly goes onpacking, as she comes at the thing from varioussharp angles. BREE Please, I'm a city person. I'm sure it's just as good as here but I'm a city person, that's all, I am! (pause) Hell I know what it's like. I was in Jersey once: the frogs go bra-a p all night! (pause) What'im I supposed to do? Mend your socks and sing in the church choir? (pause, choking) ) Do you not believe I love you? I'm honestly, honestly just --He has almost finished packing -- returns towardthe suitcase with the tin CLOCK and electric FAN,tries to fit them in as conversation continues. BREE (CONT'D) Look, why should it be yes or no? Can't we keep it going and see? I mean we can keep in touch and visit each other and see. People do that, that's realistic. KLUTE OK. BREE (bitterly) You don't believe that either, do you? Why can't you see my side? KLUTE Can you use these?He sets the fan beside her, hands her the LOUDLYTICKING clock. She holds it in her lap, numbly.He's packed -- closes various drawers, leaving ingood order -- snaps the suitcase shut, lifts itstiffly down from the table. She remains sitting. BREE Can I carry something for you, to the car? (he shakes his head) Will you kiss me? KLUTE No. I'm sore.He moves to the door, pauses, half-smiles -- KLUTE (CONT'D) Well --She smiles back. He goes.
