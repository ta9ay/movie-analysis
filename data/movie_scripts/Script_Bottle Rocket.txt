They listen intently as he briefs them on theintricacies of firearms.                         TEMPLE            A gun is a firearm. A pistol is a            firearm. But anything you hold in            your hand is a weapon. A knife. A            wrench. A ballpoint pen.                         ANTHONY            A ballpoiht pen?                         TEMPLE            Anyone who tells you a ballpoint            pen is not a weapon needs intensive            psychiatric treatment. You can            stick them in the esophagus. You            give them a ballpoint tracheotomy.They nod seriously. Temple laughs.EXT. FIELD. DAYThey're standing behind Temple's car in the middle of anopen pasture. The trunk is open.

DIGNAN            OK. Escape route. The most important            thing you can have is an escape            route. Just in case somebody's            tailing us. Or even chasing us, as            the case may be --                         ANTHONY            You think we're going to be chased?                         DIGNAN            That's a good question. No. I don't.            I'm just being hypocritical here.            However, I will say --Bob reaches for the .44.

DIGNAN                   (screaming)            What's your fucking problem? You're            a shithead!                         BOB            I just want to see how much bullets            it takes.Anthony picks up the gun off the table. He clicks the action.

It's too dangerous            for him.                         DIGNAN            Well, in reality it's not that            dangerous, Bob. It's only dangerous            if you don't know what you're doing.                         BOB            Yeah, but what if some nut pulled            gun on you?

It was just            one of those senior pranks that            didn't really go right. I mean,            obviously, since Swifty's dead.            That's why Anthony never graduated.                         BOB            His name was Swifty?                         DIGNAN            Yeah.

DIGNAN            I didn't realize you were so            sensitive to Bob's feelings.

They're walking through thekitchen.                         DIGNAN            Look, I admit I was wrong for not            telling you before the robbery that            your share wouldn't be as equal as            ours. But the fact remains me and            Anthony were much more exposed to            danger.Bob has now come to the big glass patio doors where Hectorsits outside, looking in. Bob keeps playing as he looks atHector.                         DIGNAN            I mean, Jesus Christ, Bob. You            didn't have some vicious lunatic            screaming, "I'm going to remember            you!"                         BOB                   (smiles slightly,                   keeps playing)            That's true. That would give me            nightmares.                         DIGNAN            Bob, I've got nightmares.Bob stops playing. He looks at Dignan.

ANTHONY            I hope not.                         BOB            Phil probably provoked him.                   (looking at Dignan)            Where's he going?Dignan and the officer are walking over to the backyard.                         DIGNAN            No, it was a rustling sound.

I understand your            loyalty. You're a good person. But            right now you're not using your            best judgement.Bob keeps walking.                         DIGNAN            Future Man would not want you to go            to jail I promise you. Just get in            the car and we'll talk about it.No reaction. Bob keeps walking straight ahead.                         DIGNAN            Future Man would never go to jail            for you, I'll tell you that.                         BOB            His name's not Future Man, Dignan.                         DIGNAN            I know it's not.

Because I don't care.            He's Future Man. But I care about            you. And to me it doesn't make            sense to go back to the scene of a            crime. Will you get in the car, Bob?            This is stupid.Bob stops walking.                         BOB            It's not your decision and he's not            your brother, Dignan.                         DIGNAN            That's right. I only have one vote.

Anthony and Inezare sitting on the steps beside him, in the shallow end.                         DIGNAN            See, one day we were playing hot            box over at my next door neighbor            Mr. Langston's house and Anthony            fell in the pool and got knocked            unconscious. I had to dive in and            save him.                         ANTHONY            This was in fourth grade.                         DIGNAN            Mr. Langston performed            cardiopulmonary recitation. CPR.            I've never said this before, but            frankly I thought Anthony was dead.            The veins in his face were all            sticking out. His skin was blue. He            truly did look dead.                         ANTHONY            After that my parents never let me            go to Dignan's again.                         DIGNAN            They blamed my family for everything.            They always said Mr. Langston saved            Anthony's life.Dignan stares wistfully across the pool. Anthony looks athim for a minute.                         ANTHONY            But if it wasn't for Dignan I            probably would of died.

DIGNAN            Right here.Anthony looks around the parking lot.                         DIGNAN            That coward. Son of a bitch.                         ANTHONY            Maybe he just went to the store.                         DIGNAN            He took his stuff. He's gone.                   (pause)            I should of seen this.

He shuts the door.Dignan follows him over to the sink and sits on the counter.                         DIGNAN            I mean, let's face it. Bob was dead            weight. We're a lot better off            without him.                   (pause)            But who could expect it? Just like            that. Steals the fucking car. What            kind of person pulls that --Anthony opens the door and walks out.                         ANTHONY            Bob didn't steal the car. He told            me he was going. He had to go help            his brother.Anthony sits back down on the bed. Dignan's shocked.                         DIGNAN            When'd he tell you?

DIGNAN            He told you and you let him do it.                         ANTHONY            He told me because he wanted to            know if I wanted to go.                         DIGNAN                   (hesitates)            If you wanted to go? What were you            going to do? Just leave me here by            myself?                         ANTHONY            Well, I didn't do it, did I?                         DIGNAN            So when you were saying Bob's at            the store and acting real suprised,            that was just an act. You were            just --                         ANTHONY            Bob went to help his brother. I            understand that and I can't help it            if you don't.                         DIGNAN            I understand that if I had a few            more friends like you and Bob I'd            be dead.                         ANTHONY            If you say so.INT. DINER.

DIGNAN            If you'd gone with Bob you'd            probably be in Weatherford by now.            Of course I'd be here frantically            worrying thinking you must of got            kidnapped.                         ANTHONY            I didn't realize you had such an            incredible ability to feel sorry            for yourself, Dignan.                         DIGNAN            Well, the world is a little bit            colder today.Anthony sits there thinking for a second, stating into space.Then he looks back at his map.

Dignan looks out thewindow.                         DIGNAN            I didn't know he had it in him.

The only thing I feel            like is getting the fuck out of            this place.                         ANTHONY                   (pause)            We need a car.For the first time Dignan looks away from the TV, at Anthony.                         DIGNAN            I have an idea for that.                         ANTHONY            What?

We            go into a room, grab some car keys            and --                         ANTHONY            What I'm saying is she wouldn't go            for that.

ANTHONY            Shh.                         DIGNAN            No one to back me up. Now I have a            good idea.

ANTHONY                   (kisses her)            I'll see you later.Inez goes outside. She closes the door.                         ANTHONY            I don't think we need any keys,            Dignan. I think I can hotwire a car            for us.                         DIGNAN            You don't know how to hotwire.                         ANTHONY            Yes, I do. Bob taught me.                         DIGNAN            Bob taught you how to get            electrocuted.                         ANTHONY            No, I'm serious. He made me a            diagram.EXT. SIDEWALK.

DIGNAN            What'd you say to Inez?Anthony shrugs.                         DIGNAN            "I'll come back for you. I love            you, Inez."Anthony is silent.                         DIGNAN            "I'm going to take you away from            all this windexing and making beds."Silence. Dignan exhales and looks out the window.EXT. HIGHWAY.

DIGNAN            You really know how to pick them.Anthony walks over to Dignan. He stands beside him for aminute.                         ANTHONY            I think we better go home.                         DIGNAN            Don't panic, Anthony.                         ANTHONY            I'm not. But there's --                         DIGNAN            You can't just run home every time            things get tough. First of all,            we've got enough dough to --                         ANTHONY            Our money situation is not good.                         DIGNAN                   (clapping him on the back)            You're so spoiled. What is "not            good" to you? Only a few hundred --                         ANTHONY            We've got sixteen dollars.                         DIGNAN            That's not correct.Dignan stares at Anthony.                         DIGNAN            Give it to me.Pause. Anthony reaches into his pocket and pulls out themoney. Dignan takes it. He counts it. He looks at Anthony.                         DIGNAN            Sixteen dollars.                         ANTHONY            I know.                         DIGNAN            Where's the rest?Dignan stares at Anthony. Pause.                         ANTHONY            I had to give some to Inez.

DIGNAN            What are you going to do, get            married? Have a bunch of little            idiot janitor brats!

ANTHONY            Why not?                         BOB            Cause I'm not getting any better.            It's a waste of time.                         ANTHONY            You've only been playing for two            weeks, Bob. It takes a long time to            learn this game.                         BOB            You think I'm improving?                         ANTHONY                   (pause)            Yes. You just got to stick with it.Bob looks down the fareway. He takes a deep breath andstarts walking toward his club about twenty yards away.INT. GOLF CART. DAYIn the cart. Bob's driving. There's a brief silence.                         BOB            You don't have to talk about it if            you don't want to.                         ANTHONY            No, I don't mind.                         BOB            I know it must of been a bad            experience. But it doesn't sound            like it was your fault.                         ANTHONY            Well, I didn't mean to electrocute            him. But the whole operation was my            idea.MONTAGE: Electronics wizardry. Splicing wires. Buzzingelectrodes. A filament lights up blue. Pliers and clippersrewire a circuit breaker, short out the P.A. system,electrify doors and windows. Anthony continues in VOICEOVER.                         ANTHONY (VO)            It took six months of research. I            did all the wiring myself. Switched            AC to DC. Doubled the voltage.            Shorted out the generator. The            whole school was shut down.                         BOB (VO)            That's pretty complicated for a            senior prank.                         ANTHONY (VO)            I don't like that word prank, Bob.            I was trying to do something more            than a prank.EXT. SCHOOL. DAYA large school building. Tall oak trees and benches in theshade. Green and blue lights blink in the windows. Whiteflashes and loud jolts of energy dance from room to room.Mozart plays in the distance.Students begin to swarm out into the yard.                         ANTHONY (VO)            I wanted to create an event.            Something everyone would remember.            And at first it worked perfectly.            The whole school was standing            around outside. Kids running all            over the place. Everybody laughing.EXT. GOLF COURSE. DAYAnthony and Bob are standing on the seventeenth green.                         ANTHONY            Even the school custodian Swifty            thought it was great. He kept            laughing and shaking his head the            whole time he tried to disconnect            the generator. And then suddenly                   (snaps his finger)            total silence except for Swifty            hanging off the generator with his            leg stuck to it being electrocuted.Anthony stares down the fareway.                         ANTHONY            Actually he died of a heart attack            brought on by the shock. He was an            older guy.INT. GOLF CART. DAYAnthony and Bob are driving back to the clubhouse.                         ANTHONY            I felt terrible. I'd known Swifty            since first grade. He was Dignan's            medicine man for Indian Guides.            They called each other Rattlesnake            and Killer Whale. Whenever Dignan            came to visit me he would act like            he and Swifty weren't that good of            friends, but that was just to make            me feel better. The whole rest of            the school had turned against me.EXT. BOB'S HOUSE.

BOB            Sixty days?                         ANTHONY            Yeah.

BOB            Why were you drawing the Holy Mary?                         ANTHONY            Prison tatoos. I got to be pretty            good.

DIGNAN            Yeah. It is.                         ANTHONY            Let's not even talk about it.                         BOB            It was stupid.

Dignan's looking across the room.There's Future Man and his friend CLAY fresh from a round ofgolf. They're standing on the other side of the room,looking across at Bob. They're smiling. Jackson picks up twoempty plates and walks away. Future Man and CLAY walk toBob's table.                         FUTURE MAN            Fancy seeing you here, Bob.

Anthony's crouched besidehim taking notes in a notebook.                         DIGNAN            OK. Man in blue jeans just left by            southwest door. He is entering a            white van. What time is it?                         ANTHONY            Eleven fifteen.                         DIGNAN            OK. Mark that down.                         ANTHONY            I did.Dignan keeps watching through the binoculars. He suddenlylooks back at Anthony.                         DIGNAN            God. Isn't this great? Working on            the job. Got a wheel man. Got a            safecracker. Good friends with Mr.            Henry.                         ANTHONY            Yeah. It's pretty good.                         DIGNAN            It's like we've finally arrived.Anthony nods. He's writing something.                         DIGNAN            What are you writing?Anthony shows him a little flip cartoon of a guy polevaulting.INT/EXT. PLANNING SEQUENCE. DAYWe see the team assembled around a table.

They all run for cover.Applejack and Dignan drive fast through a slalom course in adeserted parking lot.We see Kumar working on a safe. He wears a stethoscope andlistens to the tumblers. He turns the dial. Dignan is timinghim with a stopwatch.Kumar opens the safe. He looks at Dignan. Dignan nods with aserious expression on his face.EXT. RAILROAD TRACKS. DAYAnthony and Mr. Henry are jogging along railroad tracks inthe warehouse district. Anthony wears a blue T-shirt andshorts. Mr. Henry looks like a boxer in grey sweats with thehood up and a crisp white towel wrapped around his neck andtucked into his sweat top. He's wearing black Chuck Taylors.They've both got smooth running styles, though every twentyyards or so Mr. Henry rolls his shoulders and gives a quickflurry of punches. An older woman rides a bicycle across thetracks. She's not pretty, but she's got a strong face.Pioneer stock.                         MR. HENRY            Look at that woman. She's what?            Fifty? Fifty-five? But she hasn't            let herself go. I appreciate an            older woman who has a commitment to            her body.                         ANTHONY            So do I.They watch her ride down the street.                         MR. HENRY            Tell me something. What the hell            kind of name is Dignan?                         ANTHONY            I'm not really sure. I think it's            Irish. Or maybe --                         MR. HENRY            I guess what I'm trying to say is            what the hell kind of person is            this Dignan?                         ANTHONY            What do you mean what kind of            person? He's a good person.                         MR. HENRY            Sure, sure. He's a great person,            and I'd call bullshit on anybody            who said differently. But I wonder            if the kid has the goods                   (taps his temple)            up here.                         ANTHONY                   (long pause)            I don't think you're giving him            enough credit. I know sometimes he            doesn't think an idea through. He            gets too excited. But --                         MR. HENRY            As far as I can tell he hasn't            thought his life through. He'd be            fine cutting my grass or parking my            car. But business?                   (looks at Anthony)            You I can work with. You I could            groom. Dignan's not going to make it.Anthony stops running. Mr. Henry stops ahead of him andlooks back, jogging in place. Pause.                         ANTHONY            You're wrong about Dignan.Mr. Henry stops jogging in place.                         ANTHONY            And you're wrong if you think, I'd            turn my back on a friend.                         MR. HENRY            Hold it.Mr. Henry walks to Anthony and puts his hand on his shoulder.Anthony knocks it off.                         MR. HENRY            Anthony. I want.to say one thing to            you.Mr. Henry looks Anthony right in the eye.                         MR. HENRY            Congratulations. You passed the test.                         ANTHONY            What do you mean?                         MR. HENRY            The Abe Henry double-cross test.            You just made a perfect score.Anthony has to recover.                         ANTHONY            That was a test?                         MR.

ANTHONY            Mr. Henry never gave you a test,            did he?                         DIGNAN            What do you mean?

DIGNAN            How big is it?                         ANTHONY            Oh, I'd say about --                         BOB            It's in the driveway.                         ANTHONY                   (pause)            Temporarily.                         DIGNAN            Where?

It's going to            need some repairs.Dignan nods.                         ANTHONY            So how is it in there?                   (pointing at cell block)                         DIGNAN                   (shrugs)            What can I say? It's jail. You            don't sleep when you want to. You            don't eat when you want to.                         BOB            Do you have your own room?                         DIGNAN            We don't have rooms, Bob. We have            cells.                         BOB            Do you have your own cell?                         DIGNAN            No. I have a cellmate.

BOB            Do they let you --                         DIGNAN            I don't really want to talk about            it, Bob.Long pause.Anthony takes a sip from a milkshake. Dignan unwraps thefoil from a cheeseburger. He takes a bite.                         DIGNAN                   (with his mouth full                   of food)            This sure beats the shit out of the            shit they crap out in this joint.Anthony and Bob laugh. Dignan takes another huge bite.                         DIGNAN                   (smiling)            I might have to have another one of            these.

They stand there in silence. The line movesforward a few steps. Anthony and Bob walk with Dignan on theother side of the fence. The line stops. Pause.Dignan leans toward the fence.                         DIGNAN            Hey.He motions for them to come closer to the fence. He whispers:                         DIGNAN            I think I may have found a way out            of here.                         ANTHONY                   (pause)            You're kidding.                         DIGNAN            No. I'm not.                         ANTHONY            How?

Anthony and Bob walk with Dignan onthe other side of the fence.                         DIGNAN            When we go through the next gate            you'll have 30 seconds to take out            the tower guard.                         ANTHONY            What?

Bob and I'll --                         ANTHONY            Dignan, I --The line starts moving faster.                         DIGNAN            Scale the barricade and tunnel            through no man's land. And Bob.            Remember:                         ANTHONY            Scale the --                         DIGNAN            Shield me from the bullets. They            won't shoot civilians. Ready?                         BOB            Hold on --                         DIGNAN            Here we go.

He looksat Anthony and Bob. He smiles. He shrugs.                         DIGNAN            So long.Bob and Anthony slowly half-smile. They wave to Dignan asthe line of inmates turns away. Anthony looks to Bob. Bobsmiles.The line of inmates stops about fifty feet away. Dignanlooks back. Anthony looks at him. Dignan's expression haschanged. He wasn't expecting them to see it. His eyes lookcold. Anthony puts his hand on the fence. Dignan turns andthe line of inmates disappears into the cell block.Anthony stands there in silence.. He lets go of the fence.He walks with Bob down the long path in the cold air.                                            FADE OUT.
