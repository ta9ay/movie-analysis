								SCREENPLAY BY								Dan Goldberg								and								Len Blum								July 18, 1980
FADE UP ONA WHEATFIELDA beautiful field of wheat glistens in the morning sun.As the camera skims overtop, titles start to roll.  Aheadof us an odd-looking service van comes into view, sputteringalong a dirt road.  Getting closer, we can see the driver, athin, bookish man with a neat mustache.  This is AUSTIN GRIMALDI.The truck pulls up to a strange Victorian house in the middleof the wheatfield.  The house has several futuristic radardevices on the roof that rotate constantly.AUSTIN gets out, opens the van's rear doors, and pulls outtwo large metal boxes.                                             CUT TOTHE ATTIC WINDOWThe curtains part ever so slightly, and a pair of eyes peerdown.                                             CUT BACK TOTHE VANAUSTIN shuts the van's rear doors, and carries the two metalboxes into the house.  The titles stop rolling as we;                                             CUT TOINSIDE THE HOUSEAUSTIN is reading a schematic diagram as he sits in front ofthe exposed chassis of a complicated futuristic electroniccontraption, twice his size.  There are strange tools allover the floor.Putting down the diagram, he opens one of the metal cases andtakes out a sophisticated-looking glass sphere with electronicreceptacles mounted in the sides.He places this sphere in a space in the middle of the contraption,clamps it down, and plugs some wires into the globe's receptacles.Then he opens the second box.  Inside is a glowing green ball.Using a pair of special tongs, AUSTIN carefully lifts the ballout, and inserts it into an opening at the base of the machine,in the back.As soon as the ball is inside, the machine hums to life.  Theglass sphere sparkles, and a holographic picture of a greenplanet in space appears inside it.                      AUSTIN                    (looking at the holograph)                 Hmmmm ....He takes a strange tool, and moves out of frame to make anadjustment underneath the machine.  Suddenly a wire comesloose from the sphere and begins to spark.                      AUSTIN                    (seeing sparks)                 Uh - oh ....As the camera pulls closer to the holograph screen, thegreen planet begins to silently shake.                                             CUT TOSPACEWith an explosion that rocks the universe, a huge chunk ripsout of the green planet and shoots off into space, leavingthousands of glowing particles in its wake.                                             CUT BACK TOAUSTINNot noticing the silent image on the holograph, he quicklyrepairs the sparkling connection and returns to his otheradjustments.                                             CUT TOA FORESTFrom the forest floor we see the green planetoid fly overhead,dropping balls.  We watch as it moves away and disappears beyonda far-off mountain range.  The forest rumbles as the planetoidcrashes in the distance.The camera then pans over to a forest patch, where a beautifulgirl approaches, picking mushrooms.                                             CUT TOA GREEN BALL NEAR HER FEETAn ominous note is struck as the girl notices the glowingball, and is drawn to it.  Picking the sphere up, she looksat it.  Something inside her warns her of its danger, but,unable to resist, she puts it in her basket and continues on.                                             DISSOLVE TOTHE GATES OF KRAANNight falls over this futuristic chromoid city as the beautifulgirl passes through the glass gates and heads home.                                             CUT TOTHE GIRL'S BEDROOMThe girl yawns and gets into bed as the camera pans over toher basket in the corner.  Through its side, the green ballbegins to glow brightly.Getting closer, we see a slimy silk-like webbing ooze out ofthe ball and move towards the sleeping girl, pulling the greenball behind it.The ball starts to glow and pulse as the webbing begins tosurround the girl, like a cocoon.  Slowly the camera pansup the wall, and moves out through the window, and beyondthe city gates, rising higher and higher.                                             CUT TOTHE OUTLANDSFlying quickly overtop futuristic villages, the cameraheads further and further out into the less civilized sectors,where the rusting pipelines and crumbling utility stations ofa past civilization have been overgrown by scrub-bush and weeds.The camera zooms across this strange landscape toward the distantmountains where the huge planetoid fell.  Finally, from highabove the foothills, we begin to come down.In the hills below us, hundreds of blue humanoid barbarians aremoving along, mesmerized, toward a pulsing green glow high inthe mountaintops.  Suddenly the mountains begin to rumble.                                             CUT TOTHE LINE OF BARBARIANSAt the front of the line, the largest barbarian - obviouslytheir leader - stops and points.                                             CUT TOTHE MOUNTAINSA strange, green, foamy liquid comes pouring down the mountainstoward the barbarians.                                             CUT TOTHE LINE OF BARBARIANSThe barbarians stand frozen as the foam washes over them and keepson going.  One by one, their eyes turn green and they start tochange, becoming hairier, uglier, and stronger.As their transformations are complete, the barbarians gatherbehind their leader into an ever-growing mob of murderouslooking sub-humans.                                             DISSOLVE TOTHE GATES OF KRAANA frightened Kraanian councillor spurs his horse forward throughthe beautiful glass gates, as in the distance we hear the soundof ten thousand approaching footsteps.The camera pans to a hillside overlooking Kraan.  In the glowof sunset, the outline of the BARBARIAN LEADER, riding a blackwar-horse, appears at the hillside and stops.  Then with athundering of footsteps, the outline of five thousand barbarianscomes into view behind him, filling the horizon.                                             CUT TOTHE BARBARIAN LEADERHe is now wearing a strange medallion around his neck as, wild-eyed, he screams to signal the attack.  The bloodthirsty hordecharges down the hill behind him.The camera moves with the barbarians as they crash through thegates of the city, destroying everything in their path.  Smokeand flames are everywhere.  Ahead of us, terrified Kraaniansrun from the onslaught.As we track up over the burning rooftops, we see the BARBARIANLEADER riding his war-horse in the streets below.  Shoutinga command, he waves his men on as they move toward an impressivedoomed building in the middle of the city.                                             CUT TOTHE COUNCIL CHAMBERSAt the far end of this huge glass hall, the Kraanian Councilsits around a marble table.  From outside, we hear the battleraging.Pulling closer we can hear the worried voices of the Councilmembers.                      COUNCILMAN #3                 They're killing everyone.  We                 must escape!                      COUNCILMAN #2                 The city is burning!                      COUNCILMAN #4                    (throwing a parchment                     before the Elder)                 Even the mountains glow green and an                 evil slime oozes down!                      COUNCILMAN #1                 Elder, we must arm ourselves!  We                 must fight!                      ELDER                 Silence!Everyone gets quiet.  Looking at the parchment thrown beforehim, the ancient, withered ELDER rises to his feet.                      ELDER                 We are not a race of warriors.                 We are statesmen, and scientists.                 From our very beginning it was ordained                 that the warrior-race of Taarak the                 Defender would aid us in times of need.                 This was the Pact!                      COUNCILMAN #1                 Taarak the Defender?  His race is                 dead!  They cannot defend anyone!                      COUNCILMAN #2                 Some say that the race is not dead                 - that one still lives.                      COUNCILMAN #1                 One?  What good is one?                      ELDER                 One of Taarak's blood can do much.Outside, the sounds of battle grow louder.  A boy appears atthe doorway.                      BOY                 Elder!  They are at the walls!                      COUNCILMAN #3                 Well who is this last Defender?                 How can he be summoned?                      ELDER                 It is Taarna, of the blood of                 Taarak the Defender - the last of                 the race.  And must be summoned as                 my forefathers summoned Taarak                 himself - from within!                      COUNCILMAN #2                 But will this Defender answer?                      ELDER                 A Taarakian has no choice.  They                 must answer.  It is in their blood.The clattering of armour becomes audible.                      BOY                 They are in the halls!  They are coming!!                      ELDER                    (calmly to the boy)                 Bar the door.                 (to the Councilmen)                 We will summon the                 Defender together.The Councilmen nod.                      ELDER                    (shutting eyes)                 Taarna ... Taarna ...As the Councilmen take up the chant;                                             CUT TOTHE DOORAs the boy begins to bar the door, it bursts open, flinging himaside.  Standing in the doorway, surrounded by his men, isthe BARBARIAN LEADER.With a laugh, he raises a Medieval-looking multiple cross-bowand fires a burst of arrows into the boy's chest, as the crazedtroops rush in around him.The chanting continues as we;                                             CUT TOTHE OUTLANDSWe look down over this uncivilized wilderness with onlydecaying pipelines and the occasional jagged rock structurebreaking the barren uniformity of the land.  As the Council'sdistant chanting fades out, all is quiet.Suddenly from behind us, we hear the sound of flapping wingsand a huge rush of air.  Just above our heads, TAARNA THEDEFENDER comes flying in, sitting proudly in the saddle ofa giant crimson bird.                                             CUT TOTAARNA'S FACEShe is beautiful, with dark eyes and wild red hair blowingbehind her in the wind.Below her, on the ground, she sees a humanoid running in terror,chased by an ugly, four-legged mutant creature.Spurring her bird forward, TAARNA sweeps down over the uglybeast and lassoes it.  She then hoists the creature up intothe air and, tossing her end of the rope over a tall jaggedrock, she leaves the snarling beast hanging helplessly.Flying down to the grateful humanoid, she dismounts.  Asshe approaches we see that he has a barbarian medallionon a chain around his neck.                      HUMANOID                 I owe you my life.  Let me                 repay you ...He takes off his medallion and places it around her neck.Suddenly he twists the chain tight in his hand, pulling hertowards him.  His eyes change to a bright green as he forcesher to the ground and starts ripping at her clothes.  As hemolests her, TAARNA is distracted.  She hears something - voicesinside her, chanting her name.Quickly she grabs the chain and rips it apart.  Then shepowerfully smashes both her hands together around her attacker'sears.  As he holds his ringing ears, she gets up, lifts himabove her head, and hurls him mercilessly to the ground.Still hearing the chanting, she jumps on her bird, pulls outa second rope, and lassoes the barbarian's feet.  She thenlifts him up and leaves him hanging from the tall, jagged rock,next to the growling creature.As TAARNA flies off, the hanging beast eyes the barbarianhungrily.                                             CUT TOAUSTIN GRIMALDIHe is still sitting on the floor, working on his machine.As the camera pulls closer, we see that AUSTIN is reachingdeep inside the machineworks, trying to solder a small orangediode in place with an odd-style soldering iron.  The connectionbreaks, and the diode and some hot solder fall deeper into themachine and start smoking and sputtering.  As the smoke growsthicker, the machine starts to buzz loudly.                      AUSTIN                 Dammit!AUSTIN pulls his face out of the smoking chassis, grabs a pairof needlenose pliers, and reaches back to retrieve the part.The camera follows AUSTIN'S arm into the chassis, where smokesurrounds it and clouds over everything.  The buzzing soundgrows, and changes into the sound of powerful, throbbingengines.  Slowly the smoke begins to clear as we hear a voicecrackling over a radiophone.                      BOMBARDIER                    (V.O.)                 Where the hell are we?Suddenly the smoke dissipates and a formation of B-17 bomberscome tearing out into the moonlit night.                                             CUT TOTHE GROUND BELOWThe sound of jungle night creatures fills the air.  We seepalm trees silhouetted against the moon bright sky.  Thescene is almost serene.  The camera pans and suddenly thenose of a large parked bomber fills the screen, and as thecamera continues panning, we pass a large red rising sun onthe bomber's fuselage.  The pan stops at the tail of theaircraft, and we see a Japanese soldier - a guard.There is a moment of tranquillity, as jungle sounds fill theair.  The soldier almost dozes ... suddenly the cacophony ofsound stops, and for a brief moment there is complete silence... then with an agonizing wail an air raid siren shattersthe silence and the guard looks skyward, startled.Instantly all hell breaks loose as we hear pounding feet.Silhouetted figures rush by.                                             CUT TOA GUN EMPLACEMENTJapanese soldiers crank the barrel of an anti-aircraft gunskyward.  We begin to hear the sound of approaching engines.

AUSTIN uses a tool tofine-tune the holograph and an image begins to materialize;the glass gates of Kraan.As the image becomes clearer, the camera pulls closer and closerto the holograph screen.                                             CUT TOTHE GATES OF KRAANThe Council's voices still ringing in her head, TAARNA fliesin over the demolished gates.  Below her, the once-beautifulcity lies in ruins.Gliding overtop the deserted streets, she sees a column ofsmoke rising through the wrecked dome of the building in thetown's center.  As she watches the smoke rise, she pulls hardon the reins, and heads her bird up.The camera follows as she rides in through the shattered domedown to the Council Chambers below.Corpses of the Councilmen are strewn everywhere.  In thecenter of the room, a large pile of ancient books andmanuscripts lie smouldering.  Reaching the floor, TAARNAdismounts and starts to look around.  At the head ofthe marble table sits the ELDER - dead.  In front of him,a roll of parchment lies on the table.  TAARNA opens it.Carefully painted on the parchment is a circle of mountains,their tops glowing green.TAARNA looks at it, and puts it in her sack.  Then she noticesthat the ELDER is clutching something in his hand.  Pryinghis stiff fingers apart, she finds a blood-stained medallionjust like the one her attacker wore on his chain.Looking at the dead ELDER, TAARNA grips the medallion tightlyin her hand.                                             CUT TOOUTSIDE THE COUNCIL BUILDINGTAARNA flies back out through the shattered dome and surveysthe city below.  All is quiet and dark, except for a green glowcoming from a second-floor window.  Curious, she flies over,pulls up beside the window, and climbs in.                                             CUT TOGIRL'S BEDROOMEntering, TAARNA sees the slimy silk-like cocoon on the bed.The basket of fruit still sits on the floor.  Fromwithin the webbing, the green ball is glowing brightly.TAARNA looks at the parchment in her sack, then at the glowcoming from the cocoon.  Cautiously, she approaches the cocoon,sword drawn.Suddenly a hand from within the cocoon grabs the ball andshoots forward, ripping through the webbing and holding theball up to TAARNA's face.  The hand belongs to a hideouslyugly witch, who emerges from the cocoon, cackling throughsnake-like fangs.                      WITCH                 Behold!  The Sphere of Uluhtec!                 Look upon it, Taarna.  Look upon                 it with fear.  For in its glow lies                 the end of heaven - the beginning of                 hell.  Take it Taarna.  Feel death                 in your hands.  For death is upon                 you.  And as you perish ... so dies                 your race!The witch's eyes go green.

Then TAARNA, sword raised, leapsat the WITCH, slicing through her in rapid strokes.The WITCH cackles and crumbles into dust, but her green eyesstay suspended in the air, and her cackle echoes throughthe room.TAARNA backs away, climbing out the window, onto her bird.  Asshe flies off, she sees the WITCH'S green ball high above her,rising into the clouds and disappearing.

Gettingcloser we see that is is a modern winged rocketplane of nodeterminable nationality, soaring high above Earth.  The greenmeteorite passes, briefly bathing the rocketplane in its glow.The rocketplane banks sharply, then stabilizes.  Slowly thehatch-doors in its belly open up, revealing the underside ofan automobile suspended in the open hatch.Hydraulic metal arms emerge, lowering the automobile out fromthe belly of the cruising rocketplane.  We can see nowthat the car is a white, '59 Corvette convertible.With a "thunk", the metal arms release the car, andas the rocketplane blasts away, the Corvette begins itsfree-fall to Earth.As the car falls gracefully through space, the driver playswith the wheel, causing the Corvette to bank smoothly oneway, then the other.Once his direction is stable, the driver clicks on the carradio and adjusts it through various channels, until he settleson one.With the music playing, the car falls closer and closer toEarth, entering and emerging from the cloud cover over theatmosphere.  In the heat of entry the vehicle's paint startsburning up.As he heads down over a deserted area, the driver begins hisapproach.  Touching down at breakneck speed, the smokingCorvette bounces violently, every part straining at therepeated impact.The driver's face is expressionless as he jams the car intohigh gear and floors it, spinning the wheels in an attemptto translate downward momentum into forward motion.  Thenhe pops his drag chute to help slow down.TThis accomplished, the expressionless driver releases thechute, and speeds off down the road in a cloud of dust.

When she touches it, a rock panel slides away to reveala gold chest.  TAARNA opens it.Inside the chest lies a glistening set of armoured garments,so bright that TAARNA must shield her eyes for a moment.  Then,as she looks down at the armour, the voice of TAARAK THEDEFENDER comes into her head.                      TAARAK                    (V.O.)

Finallywe pull back to see her fully.Standing before us, glistening in the torch-light, she looksmagnificent.  Reaching once more into the chest, TAARNA pullsout a golden sword.  As she holds it, it seems to vibrate,almost buzzing in her hands.  Suddenly she swings it, slicingcleanly through one of the stone torches on the rock wall.

CUT TOTHE NEVERWHERE PYRAMIDARD is incanting to the raging water while two hooded monksstand beside him, holding the struggling KATHERINE out overthe pool.                      ARD                 Here is your sacrifice, Uluhtec.                 Now, give me your power!                 (to monks)                 Throw her in.Chanting the name "Uluhtec", the two monks start to throwthe girl in when suddenly a third monk leaps forward andgrabs her, kicking the other two monks into the water.The intruder's hood falls away and his bald head gleams in themoonlight.

You'll ruin everything!ARD jumps up and runs toward the Loc-Nar, perched in the stoneidol's hand.  Grabbing it, ARD holds the glowing ball above him.                      ARD                    (to his guards)                 Kill them!  Kill them both!Suddenly, a hand leaps out of the darkness, gripping theLoc-Nar just above Ard's hand - it is the QUEEN.                      QUEEN                 The Loc-Nar is mine!                      ARD                    (struggling)                 Stupid bitch!  Get away from me!As ARD and the QUEEN fight over the Loc-Nar, the Queen's troopspour in and battle with Ard's soldiers.  Thunder roars overhead.                                             CUT TODENHolding KATHERINE in one arm, DEN smashes a nearby soldier andgrabs the beast's spear.  With the battle raging all aroundhim, DEN looks up at the sky.                                             CUT TOTHE SKYLightning crackles, illuminating the night with electricity.                                             CUT BACK TODENDEN reaches down, picks up the long chain that was wrapped aroundthe glass case and attaches one end to his spear.  He kicks theother end into the raging water, then heaves the spearwith all his might into the head of the stone idol.In the same instant, a bolt of lightning fires down from the sky,striking the idol full force.  The lightning bolt travels throughthe spear and down the chain, into the water.  Suddenly, theelectrical energy arcs across to join with the Loc-Nar.Holding onto the Loc-Nar, ARD and the QUEEN begin to glow green,then de-materialize into a shimmering dimensional warp.  Thetroops stop fighting and look on in amazement, until allthat remains is the glowing Loc-Nar, hanging in mid-air.                      KATHERINE                    (to Den)                 Where did they go?                      DEN                 They are gone.  That is all                 that matters.

KATHERINE                 Oh, but Den, with the Loc-Nar                 you could have returned to Earth.                      DEN                 I like it better here.The lizard banks sharply away from us and carries them into thedistance.                      DAN                    (V.O.)

CUT TOTHE NEVERWHERE PYRAMIDThe camera pans down the stone statue to the glowing sphere,which lies abandoned on the ground.  The soldiers are gone.  Aswe watch, time begins to accelerate and the Neverwhere Pyramidages and crumbles all around the green ball.  The earth heavesand shifts, and dense vegetarian grows up through the cracks inthe ground.A prehistoric man walks up and sees the glowing ball under a fern.Fascinated, he picks it up and looks at it, as the foot of aTyrannosaurus Rex comes down, crushing him.Time advances again as the dinosaur becomes a skeleton, anda Biblical tent-community grows up around the ball.  In thefire-light, the Nomadic tribesmen are watering their animals,when one of the camels paws at the ground, uncovering the glowingball.  Scared, the camel struggles and trys to break its ropes.Out of nowhere a Roman Legion attacks, slaughtering the tribesmen.Time accelerates again, and the conquering Romans build a temple,placing the green ball in the head of a golden idol.  Then theRomans grow fat and debauched, while slave-girls feed them grapes.As the ball glows, the temple crashes down around the debauchedRomans, covering them and the green ball in rubble.Over the ruins of the temple, a succession of primitive mud andclay huts evolve into the thatched-roof cottages of a Medievalvillage.A Medieval stone-cutter finds the ball, and mortars it in withhis stones as he builds a water well in the centre of the village.Satisfied with his work, he lowers the bucket to draw himselfa drink.  Behind him, an  ox-cart comes roaring around a corner.The axle breaks and a heavy wooden wheel careens along, strikingthe stone-cutter in the back and knocking him into the well.Time advances once more as the Medieval village grows andtransforms into a Victorian-style town.  It is evening, andthe stone well now sits under a gazebo at the centre of a gas-lit village green.A fancy carriage carrying a Victorian gentleman passes by andcircles the green.Moving in through a window across the street, we see a seductive-looking woman dressing herself in black garters and lace.  Thisis intercut with the carriage circling the green, until thewoman, who looks like a high-class harlot, finishes dressing andleaves her room.  Crossing the street, she walks up to the gazeboand leans provocatively up against the well.The gentleman gets out of his carriage, approaches the womanand propositions her.  She smiles, touches, and teases him. Wepan down their legs to the green ball glowing in the well-wall.Suddenly red blood begins to drip over the ball, and the woman'sbody falls to the ground.  The camera pans up to the well-bucket,where the gentleman is washing the blood from his hands.As time begins to move forward again, the man ages and hobblesaway, as the well crumbles and cheap turn-of-the-century row-housing grows up, covering the green ball.  The town becomesdirtier and blacker, and smokestacks blow soot into the morningsky.  Almost on cue, the doors of the houses open, and grimcoal-miners emerge, shuffling through the filthy streets ontheir way to work.The camera pans down to a drain in the gutter.  A rat appears.Panning back up, the street is now empty.  A bell is heardringing, and a horse-drawn Red Cross cart pulls around a cornerand into view.  Masked workers follow the cart.  One ringsthe bell, while the others pull corpses from the doorways andload them into the cart.  The gutters and windowsills are nowfull of rats.  Time advances again and the buildings becomedeserted derelicts.  Their decaying timbers groan under theweight.A support snaps, and one of the buildings starts to collapse.Falling amidst the crumbling plaster and rotting wood is theglowing green ball.  As the ball hits the ground, it is coveredover by rubble.The rubble becomes bleached by the hot sun and the landscapegrows drier.  Sand blows all around, covering over everything.As the sandstorm clears, the entire terrain is nothing butdesert.  In the distance we can see a group of people walking.                                             CUT TOPEOPLEThe people appears to be a band of aboriginal workmen, carryingfuturistic laser-shovels over their shoulders.  They are led bya goateed archaeologist with an elaborate metal detector.  Ashe walks, his detector starts bleeping.  He points to a spoton the ground, and the natives start digging with their laser-shovels.One of the workers finds something.                      WORKER                 Kuma!  Kuma!  Kuma!The archaeologist waves the workers away and directs a tread-driven shovel-sifter up to the spot.  The shovel-sifter digsin and pulls up a large chunk of desert.  When the sand hassifted out, we see the tarnished Loc-Nar in the machine's grip.It is not glowing.  The machine swivels, and a native foremanplucks the Loc-Nar from the shovel-sifter's teeth.As the foreman touches it, the Loc-Nar starts glowing brightly.The foreman's hands turn green.  He looks at his green hands,then he looks over to the archaeologist.  Suddenly the foreman'sentire body glows green, and crumbles into dust.The archaeologist and the natives stare in horror at theglowing Loc-Nar, lying in the pile of green dust.                                             DISSOLVE TONEW YORK - AERIAL SHOT - DAYThe camera comes down from high above the city.  The generalshape and outline of New York looks familiar, but as we getcloser we sense that something is different.  Fires areburning in various locations below us, and intermittentgunshots become audible as the narration begins.                      HARRY                    (V.O.)

It stops full frame onthe newspaper held in the cabdriver's hands.  A slow pan acrossthe front page reveals that the paper is the New York Times,July 6, 2031One headline reads: "400,000 Traffic Deaths Over Holiday Weekend".Another reads: "Venus Declared 73rd State".The camera stops on a headline reading: "Professor DiscoversAncient Relic --- to be shown in N.Y.
