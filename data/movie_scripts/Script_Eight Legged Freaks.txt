They're definitely getting             bigger.                           JOSHUA             I've calculated a growth factor of             twelve percent over the last             forty-eight hours.

Maybe             I should try some.Mike pauses at the desert tank, watching a cricket searchfor food. A trap-door spider pops out of its camouflagedden like a jack-in-the-box. The arachnid yanks thecricket below and replaces the roof in a nanosecond.Mike looks in another tank where ogre-eyed spittingspiders shoot blasts of paralyzing goo at haplessinsects.

You'd be             spider chow, kid.Mike looks in a tank where jumpers chase fleeingcrickets. He moves toward another tank that is coveredwith a towel.                           MIKE             Are the new tarantulas in here?                           JOSHUA             Took me forever to get a breeding             set of Chilean reds. I must have             bribed every customs agent from             Vegas to Santiago.Joshua unveils the    tank. Dirt floor. Several burrowentrances. Joshua     pours in the bugs. A large, maletarantula comes out    of a burrow. It pounces on a bug,then wraps its prey    in webbing, turning the insect into amummy-like bundle.                           MIKE             That is too cool.                           JOSHUA             Male tarantulas compete for the             female's attention.
