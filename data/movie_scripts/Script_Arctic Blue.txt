ARCTIC BLUEby Ross LaMannaFADE IN:1	EXT.  BOREAL FOREST - ALASKA - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAYFlying.  Not at the intangible height of a jet, but atspitting distance from the treetops.  We're in centralAlaska, the Big Lonely, just north of the Arctic Circle.A thick forest follows the contours of mountain foothillslike a deep-pile carpet.  Up at treeline the forest thins totundra, a grassy scruff turning red and yellow with thecoming of autumn.On the horizon, the hills rise to meet the EndicottMountains, a great fortress wall of granite so sharp andjagged that snow cannot stick to its face.  This is how allNorth America once looked -- raw, indomitable.Then, abruptly coming into the SCENE is a colossal etchingacross the landscape too deliberate to be of natural origin.Bisecting this country like a metallic ribbon -- or a scar,depending on your point of view -- is the 800-mile-longTrans-Alaskan Pipeline.Even the immensity of the pipeline is rendered insignificantby the vastness of the land.  It goes on, and on, and on...DISSOLVE TO:A lone MAN walks along the Haul Road, a one-lane graveltrail running parallel to the pipeline.  The weather turnssour -- rough wind and stinging snow cut across the man'spath.DISSOLVE TO:The man is ERIC DESMOND, twenty-four, clean-shaven,determined.  He's clearly out of place here, dressed in abusiness suit and a light, camel-hair topcoat.Eric is trying to follow some footprints in the snow -- apredator's tracks, those of a wolf or coyote.  But thefootprints ahead have faded, covered by the snow and wind.DISSOLVE TO:The weather becomes more oppressive.  Heavy snow, gale windsand sub-zero temperatures make his progress tortuous.  Ericstrives stubbornly forward.																(CONTINUED)1	CONTINUED:DISSOLVE TO:Eric has gathered some branches.  He tries to make a fire.Moisture from his breath has frozen in the upturned collarof his insufficient coat, and his skin is split raw from thecold.His hands are too numb to hold the matches.  After severalattempts at striking one, he slumps down next to the pile ofwood, exhausted and frustrated.DISSOLVE TO:The snow has covered the pile of branches.  Eric still sitsnext to it, partially covered in snow himself.ERICHis face is a death mask: eyes half-open and dull, lips apurplish blue, bloodless skin crystallizing as it ices over.The wind HOWLS around him.  The snow sticks to his eyelashesand hair without melting.																		END DREAM2	INT.  DARK BEDROOM - NIGHTEric bolts up in bed.  Next to him, ANNE MARIE GAUVIN sitsup and hugs him.  All that can be seen of her in the dark isa lovely silhouette and a cascade of dark hair.  After amoment, Eric kisses her.  He shakes off the dream and liesback down.3	EXT.  HAUL ROAD AND PIPELINE - CLOSE - DAYA metal sign, peppered with shotgun holes, is posted near apipeline support piling:									PIPELINE UTILITY CORRIDOR				  PRIVATE PROPERTY				  NO   TRESPASSING				  NO	  HUNTING				  NO	 TRAPPING				  NO	 SHOOTINGWIDEREric walks quietly past the sign, intent on something aheadof him.  Although still somewhat boyish in appearance, he'sconfident and resolute in attitude.  His clothes have adistinctly western feel: Lucchese boots, Levis 501's, Mahancotton shirt.  His down parka is unzipped in the sunny,windless, forty-degree afternoon.																(CONTINUED)3	CONTINUED:He pauses, then brings to his shoulder a rifle with afour-power scope mounted atop it.  He peers through thescope.HIS POV - THROUGH SCOPEHe puts the crosshairs on the shoulder flank of a big,ivory-white timber wolf, fifty yards away.BACK TO SCENEAnne Marie stands beside Eric, a Nikon with a telephoto lensin her hand, holding her breath in anticipation.  She'stwenty-three, pretty, with soft features and piercing blueeyes.  She wears Eddie Bauer woman's gear like she was bornin it.Eric expertly fixes his aim and slowly squeezes the trigger.But instead of a loud retort, there is only the dull POP ofa CO2-powered dart gun.NEW ANGLEThe tranquilizer dart finds its mark in the wolf's fleshyshoulder.  The wolf takes off running, but almostimmediately slows, sits, then lies down.Eric and Anne Marie hurry over to the wolf, who is breathingdeeply.  Eric kneels next to him and strokes his thick fur.										ERIC			What a beauty.			(to Anne Marie)			Hand me the transmitter.Anne Marie passes to Eric a tiny, weatherproof homing deviceattached to a steel collar band.  Eric puts the collarloosely around the wolf's neck and crimps it in place, allthe while TALKING soothingly to the semi-conscious animal.Anne Marie smiles at Eric's tenderness and snaps somephotos.With the collar in place and transmitter activated, Ericbacks away while the wolf tries to rouse itself from itsnarcosis.										ERIC			(continuing)			He's coming around fine.										ANNE MARIE			Be right back.  I left my			camcorder in the car.																(CONTINUED)3	CONTINUED:  (2)FOLLOW ANNE MARIEas she hurries back to their International Scout.  On thedoor of the Scout is a stylized logo of an oil derrick,under which are the words:									NORTHLAND PETROLEUM CORP.Anne Marie opens the hatchback and grabs a video camera.ANGLE ON ERIC AND THE WOLFEric smiles as the wolf wobbles tentatively to his feet andtrots unsteadily away.  Near the treeline the wolf turns,glances back at Eric and then disappears into the forest.NEW ANGLEAnne Marie is taping the wolf's retreat.  Looking throughthe viewfinder, she crosses a gully between a pipelinepiling and a rock formation.  Eric turns toward her and aglint of light in the debris at her feet catches his eye.										ERIC			Anne Marie!  Stop!She glances down.  Something metal is half-buried in thedead leaves and gravel.										ERIC			(continuing)			Don't move.Eric runs over.  He pokes at the object with a stick.  Witha SNAP, a steel leg trap chomps the stick in half.  AnneMarie jumps back.  Eric brushes the dead leaves on theground behind her and she carefully backtracks out of thegully.										ERIC			(continuing)			Goddamn trappers!He angrily rips the trap out of the ground, unearthingseveral others attached to one another by a long chain.										ERIC			(continuing)			Takes nerve, laying traplines on			restricted land.Eric slips the scope off the dart rifle and climbs up thepipeline on foot pegs to the top of an anchoring poINT.																(CONTINUED)3	CONTINUED:  (3)Using the scope as a telescope, he scans up and down theHaul Road.										ANNE MARIE			What are you doing?										ERIC			He still might be around.  I saw			fresh tire tracks coming in.HIS POV - THROUGH SCOPEThe road and the pipeline stretch toward either horizon,north and south.  In the distance, a jeep is parked on theHaul Road.  Near it, a Man climbs down into another shallowravine.BACK TO SCENEEric hurries down the footpegs.										ERIC			Man and a jeep, about a mile and			a half down.He jumps into the Scout.  Anne Marie stuffs her cameras intothe hatchback.  As soon as she climbs in, Eric tears out.4	INT.  SCOUT - (MOVING SHOT)It races along the dusty gravel road at 60 MPH.5	EXT.  HAUL ROADStartled at the APPROACH of the Scout, the Trapper uprootshis traps and runs out of the ravine.  He WHISTLES andanother Trapper appears nearby.6	INT.  TRAPPERS' JEEPThey pile into their dilapidated, all-terrain jeep.  It'soddly well-equipped, however.  Bolted to the dashboard is anexpensive tape player and a beat-up radio beacon receiverwith a round locating screen.  They zoom off.7	INT.  SCOUT - (MOVING SHOT)Eric stomps on the gas.  The dust from the jeep obscures hisview but he's gaining on them anyway.  Anne Marie hangs onand squints her eyes against the choking dust.8	INT.  TRAPPERS' JEEP - (MOVING SHOT)The driver is LEMALLE (35), a tall, ugly, rawboned Canadian.His entire outfit is made of animal hide.  He has long redhair, and a reptilian face usually twisted into a sadisticsneer.  While driving, he scans along the pipeline.										LEMALLE			Where the fuck did you drop			Corbett off?In the passenger seat, MITCHELL (38), chews tobacco andlooks grim.  He's a squat, flat-faced Okie, with curlymatted hair and tired grey eyes.  He's dressed in a brownlong coat and has a Colt .45 Peacemaker in a quick-drawholster strapped to his leg.  Despite his intimidating air,confrontation is not his style.He spots a figure up ahead, where the road crosses a muddycreek.										MITCHELL			He's over there.9	EXT.  HAUL ROADTurning sharply, the trappers' jeep splashes through thecreek bed without slowing.  Bouncing, it comes down hardagainst the axle-deep bank at the creek's high water mark.LeMalle tries to back out, but can't find traction in themud.Eric stops the Scout thirty yards behind them.10   INT.  SCOUTEric opens his door.  To Anne Marie:										ERIC			Stay here.										ANNE MARIE			Be careful -- there're two of			them.Eric reaches in the back seat and hands something to AnneMarie.										ERIC			If I unzip my parka, stick this			out the window.11   EXT.  HAUL ROADEric confidently approaches the jeep.																(CONTINUED)11   CONTINUED:Then, a third trapper climbs from the creek.  He's got aline of traps slung around his neck and a world ofexperience on his face.  He's BEN CORBETT, a life-longhuntsman, somewhere past forty, weathered beyond his years.He has a feral nose, thick beard and dark, smart, hunter'seyes.  He wears a hooded cotton sweat shirt, cottoncoveralls and vapor-barrier mountain boots.  On his belt isa holster rig cradling a .44 magnum revolver.Eric slows down.  He didn't expect to face anyone asformidable as Corbett.12   INT. / EXT. JEEPEmboldened by Corbett's presence, LeMalle reaches into theback seat and grabs his 6.5 by 55 Swedish military carbine.										CORBETT			(to LeMalle)			No shooting.  Let's see who's so			interested in us.Corbett has an incongruously affable voice.  He throws histraps into the jeep, then strides closer toward Eric.										MITCHELL			(to Corbett)			Ain't worth it, Ben...13   EXT.  HAUL ROAD - CREEK CROSSING - LONG SHOTAs Corbett comes closer, Eric realizes this might not'vebeen a great idea.  Corbett squints his eyes and sniffs theair, as if by this he can gauge his opponent's mettle.										ERIC			You got two counts against you --			trapping out of season and			poaching on restricted land.										CORBETT			Can't be much of a crime, if all			they got minding the area is a			cocky kid.										ERIC			I got your plate number, asshole.			Maybe you feel like spending a			few months in jail.Corbett just smiles.																(CONTINUED)13   CONTINUED:But LeMalle, rankled, sticks the carbine out the jeepwindow.Seeing the rifle pointed at him, Eric freezes, then slowlyunzips his parka.										LEMALLE			Ben?  Sure you don't want me to			drop the fucker?Corbett doesn't answer.  Then, his eyes narrow and he lookspast Eric at the Scout.CORBETT'S POVThe passenger in the Scout sticks what looks like anotherrifle out the window.BACK TO SCENEEric quickly glances over his shoulder to make sure AnneMarie's backing him up.										ERIC			You leave and don't come back,			that's the end of it.After a long moment, Corbett smiles again, then turns awayfrom Eric.  He motions LeMalle to the front of the jeep.Frustrated, LeMalle slams back the safety on the carbine andthrows it in the back seat.ANGLE ON TRAPPERSMitchell climbs into the jeep and starts the engine.LeMalle and Corbett rock the jeep back and forth in the rut.While pushing, Corbett rips the sole of his boot on a sharppiece of granite.   He cusses and pushes harder.14   EXT.  HAUL ROAD - CREEK CROSSINGEric walks back to the Scout.  He feels the trappers' eyeson his back, but forces himself not to hurry.The trappers free their vehicle.  Corbett gets in thedriver's seat, and they take off.15   INT.  SCOUTAnne Marie's hands are shaking as she pulls the plastictranquilizer rifle back in the window.																(CONTINUED)15   CONTINUED:										ANNE MARIE			(unnerved)			Great idea -- pointing a lousy			dart gun at some nut with a			high-powered hunting rifle.										ERIC			Bastards took off, though, didn't			they?16   EXT.  BOREAL FOREST - LATER THAT DAYThe trappers have left the flatlands of the Haul Road area.Now their jeep climbs a pathway over the rolling foothills.17   INT.  TRAPPERS' JEEP - (MOVING SHOT)Corbett broods while driving.  Mitchell looks out thewindow.  The silence makes LeMalle uncomfortable.										LEMALLE			All this fuckin' land, and we're			locked out.  Makes me puke.										CORBETT			Jawing about it won't change it.										LEMALLE			Three hundred seventy-five			million acres in this state.  I'm			real tired of runnin' into			people.										MITCHELL			Then don't look to your left.18   EXT.  SPORTSMEN'S CAMPA brand-new Land Rover is parked on an alluvial fan in abend in a small river.  Scattered about is an assortment ofexpensive camping gear, beer cans, spent shells and othergarbage.Three toy-macho, vacationing SPORTSMEN are guzzling beer andBLASTING fish in the shallow river with 12-gauge shotguns.They look up and glower suspiciously as the jeep slows andstops.19   INT.  TRAPPERS' JEEPLeMalle grabs his carbine.										CORBETT			Leave it here.																(CONTINUED)19   CONTINUED:										MITCHELL			Let's keep going.  We're only an			hour from Devil's Cauldron.										CORBETT			(pats Mitchell's shoulder)			Relax.  I just want to ask them			how the hunting is.20   EXT.  SPORTSMEN'S CAMPCorbett gets out of the jeep.  He regards the Sportsmen,their shotguns and their mess with ill-concealed contempt.The Sportsmen clutch their weapons and watch Corbett.  Hewalks around the camp, spotting a rubber-lined rucksackstuffed with dead ermine.  After a long, tense moment,Corbett smiles.										CORBETT			Looks like you've had some luck.			Where's your guide?										SPORTSMAN #1			We're on our own, if it's any of			your damn business.										CORBETT			(re ermine)			You did real good.He crouches next to the dead animals and strokes the fur.										LEMALLE			(to Corbett)			No swinging shit.  They're over			their goddamned limit.										CORBETT			(to Sportsmen)			My friend is right.  Supposed to			have a licensed guide when you're			on this land, too.										SPORTSMAN #1			Hey, we paid our fuckin' permit			fees.LeMalle amuses himself by pissing in their campfire.  No onenotices that in the b.g., quiet Sportsman #3 unzips hisparka, exposing a .45 Peacemaker in a belt holster.																(CONTINUED)20   CONTINUED:										SPORTSMAN #2			I were you, I'd drive right on			outta here again.  Now.										CORBETT			(calmly)			This was my roaming land, 'til			the government took it over.			Only Innuit can hunt here now,			and tourists, like you.Corbett swings the rucksack of carcasses onto the hood ofthe Land Rover.  Pissed, Sportsmen #1 and #2 step closer tohim.										CORBETT			(continuing)			According to tribal law, hunters			passing through the land of			another tribe can only take game			to survive.  They can eat the			meat, but have to surrender the			hides.LeMalle pulls a hunting knife and holds up one of theermine.										LEMALLE			Want the meat?										SPORTSMAN #1			Fuck you, dirtball.Corbett chuckles and Mitchell spits.WIDERLeMalle digs through the camping goodies in the back of theLand Rover, many still in their packages.  He helps himselfto some sandwiches and a 12-pack of beer.										LEMALLE			I say shoot 'em, bury 'em with			their shiny new car.										MITCHELL			(to LeMalle)			If you're gonna take something,			take it and let's go.Corbett looks down to fasten the top of the rucksack.																(CONTINUED)20   CONTINUED:  (2)NEW ANGLESuddenly, Sportsman #3 reaches inside his parka and pullsthe pistol.  He swings it toward LeMalle.LeMalle looks up when he hears the HAMMER cock.There is a deafeningly loud SHOT.Sportsman #3 falls down dead at LeMalle's feet.Off to one side, Corbett holds a huge, smoking .44 magnumsix-shooter in his hand.Shotgun in hand, Sportsman #1 gauges his chances of blastingCorbett.  Nil.  When Corbett turns to him, he lies theweapon down.  Sportsman #2 rushes to his friend.Looking bleak, Mitchell spits again.  Corbett crosses toLeMalle and knocks from his hands the things he wanted tosteal.  Chastised, LeMalle smolders.  After a moment:										CORBETT			(to Sportsmen)			Put him in your truck.  Smell of			blood will attract the bears.			(to trappers)			Let's go.As Corbett walks to the jeep, he's too angry to notice thathe's stepped in a patch of mud under the Land Rover.Near the jeep, LeMalle stops and pulls them into a huddle.										LEMALLE			I don't believe in leavin'			witnesses behind, Ben.										MITCHELL			It was self defense.  Leave it at			that.										LEMALLE			You think those fucks will tell			it that way?										CORBETT			(ending the argument)			We'll get a head start before			they go crying to the law.Corbett turns and FIRES two rounds from his .44 into theengine of the Land Rover.  The Sportsmen stare and sputter.																(CONTINUED)20   CONTINUED:  (3)										CORBETT			(continuing; to Sportsmen)			You can pack out of here -- two,			three days' hike along this river			at most.  Weather should hold			this early in the season.Corbett and Mitchell get in their jeep.LEMALLEisn't yet satisfied.  He walks back over to the Sportsmen,kneeling beside their fallen friend, and crouches rightbeside them.  Intimidated, Sportsman #2 looks away, butLeMalle grabs his chin and turns his face back toward him.										LEMALLE			Think I'm pretty?  You better			forget how we look, 'cause next			time they won't keep me from			killing you.  This land ain't			quite civilized, you know...He unsheathes his buck knife.  BELOW FRAME, he slices acrossthe forehead of the dead Sportsman, peels back his scalp andcuts it loose, Indian-style.  The Sportsmen are stunned andsickened.ANGLE ON TRAPPERS' JEEPCorbett looks at Mitchell and wearily shakes his head.										MITCHELL			At least he scalped the dead one.21   EXT.  DEVIL'S CAULDRON - DUSKDevil's Cauldron Hot Springs is a cluster of twenty tinydwellings connected by an unpainted boardwalk.  The townsquats, ugly and temporary-looking, in a dirt clearing fiftymiles north of the Arctic Circle.  Thirty miles east of thePipeline, it's almost dead center of interior Alaska.At the edge of town is a gravel airstrip.  Mixed with theprospector-era sod-roof cabins are a few prefabricatedhouses.  The boon brought by men building the pipeline islong gone.  Now only a few itinerant loggers, natives andbush dwellers remain to fight boredom, each other and thedepression of the oncoming winter.Enough steam escapes from the hot springs to perpetuallyblanket the valley with fog.  The spa is log-walled andhorseshoe- shaped, with partitioned baths inside.

KENAI'S GENERAL STORECorbett and the other trappers drive past Meyerling and parktheir jeep as the sun disappears behind the foothills.23   INT.  KENAI'S GENERAL STOREA handwritten public notice next to a schedule of churchmeetings reads: "Live each day so you can look every damnman in the eye and tell him to go to hell."  There is a postoffice in the corner with some combination boxes and awicketless window.The trappers come in.  Corbett sits in a chair and pulls hisboots off.  One of his wool socks is wet.  He nods to theman sitting in the other chair, SAM WILDER.  Wilder is shortand tough, with a full head of crewcut grey hair andweather- ravaged face that makes him look older than hissixty years.										CORBETT			Hullo, Sam.  Slow day?										WILDER			(wary)			Ben...boys.  Yeah, real slow, and			I'd like to keep it that way.										CORBETT			(conciliatory)			Just passing through.A chubby Inupiat (interior Eskimo), wearing thick glasses,several heavy sweaters and battery-heated socks, fussesbehind the counter.  He's EARL KENAI, owner of the hotsprings spa and the general store.LeMalle chews on a handful of bear jerky.  Kenai stares atLeMalle until he begrudgingly pays for the jerky.

Meyerling comes in and posts some fliers on thecorkboard.										MEYERLING			I hope I can count on you			gentlemen to vote for The			People's Friend this November.										CORBETT			Share some of that oil company			money in your pocket and you can.Meyerling smiles like a toad, then slaps another poster onthe wall.  LeMalle throws his knife and it STICKS in theposter between Meyerling's spread fingers.  Meyerling jumpsback and the trappers laugh.  Meyerling looks to Wilder forsupport.										WILDER			(to Meyerling)			One flier comes loose and I shoot			you for littering.

LeMalle cleanshis carbine while eating beans and bacon.  Mitchell hunchesover a table.  He's making a scrimshaw -- delicatelyengraving, using homemade tools, on a palm-sized piece ofwhale bone.  He rubs his eyes and looks up at Corbett.										MITCHELL			So much for the walking weather			you predicted.																(CONTINUED)25   CONTINUED:										CORBETT			Had no choice...

It's a double-unit weathertight cocoon of fiberglassand aluminum, pulled by a diesel rig on oversized tires.The front module is 12 by 24, the rear 12 by 18.An extended-cab pickup pulls up and Sam Wilder gets out.The gravel-and-dirt Haul Road, paralleling the pipeline for400 miles, is closed to the public.  An arriving vehicle,therefore, is news.  The front door of the dwelling opens.Eric and Anne Marie come outside, delighted to see Wilder.

Anne Marie's getting cabin fever			already.Anne Marie shoots a look at Eric but doesn't disagree --this is obviously an issue with them.  Wilder looks withamusement at the mobile dwelling.										WILDER			What'd you say they call these			spaceships?										ERIC			Mobile Arctic Dwelling -- MAD.										ANNE MARIE			I call it 'the Turtle,' as in			carrying your home on your back.										ERIC			Best thing is, Meyerling has to			chase around to find us.										ANNE MARIE			(laughs)			The little creep hates it that			Eric actually does what the			company hired him to do.

Likely that's an SOS.			Have to pass on that lunch.										ERIC			We'll go with you.																		CUT TO:27   EXT.  SPORTSMEN'S CAMP - LATER THAT DAYEverything seems peaceful enough.  The SOS fire (made fromburning green branches for white smoke and rubber for blacksmoke) has burnt down to embers.Eric, Anne Marie and Wilder pull up in Wilder's pickup.The two Sportsmen sit in the front seat of the Land Rover,but they don't react to the arrival of the rescuers.  In theback seat, a reflective camping blanket covers a large mass.Something is amiss.  Eric shoots a look of trepidation atAnne Marie as they get out of the pickup.   Wilder pulls thedoor of the Land Rover open.A Sportsman slumps out onto the ground.  His eyes are openand his tongue pokes out between his lips.  His skin isblue-white. (He looks, in fact, much like Eric's nightmare.)Startled, Eric steps back.  Anne Marie gasps with horror.Wilder unzips the Sportsman's light windbreaker and listensfor a heartbeat.  Nothing.										WILDER			Stupid goddamn greenhorns!  Froze			to death.										ANNE MARIE			It's not even winter!										WILDER			They got wet in the rain.

The starter TURNS OVER, but theengine makes a horrendous GRINDING.  He walks to the frontof the vehicle.  Noticing the bullet holes in the grille, hebends down for a closer look.NEW ANGLEEric opens the rear hatchback and digs through the plentifulsupplies.  Still in their packages are some matchbox-sizedELT locating beacons.										ERIC			They had Emergency Locater			Transmitters, but didn't use			them.			(opens one up; shakes his				head)			Maybe because they didn't bring			batteries.CLOSEAnne Marie opens the back door of the Land Rover.

Corbett's awful			hardbitten these days.Wilder leans against the Land Rover, feeling tired.										WILDER			(continuing)			His old roaming area's all			private reserve now.

HOT SPRINGS SPACorbett soaks in one of the huge wooden tubs with a pudgyInupiat hooker, DIXIE.He looks up as Eric comes into the spa.  Eric holdsCorbett's boots, which have been repaired.  Eric pauses whenhe sees Corbett.  There is a flash of recognition betweenthem.										ERIC			Ben Corbett?										CORBETT			Yep.  Afraid you have me at a			disadvantage.										ERIC			Kenai at the general store asked			me to bring these.  Didn't expect			we'd already met.										CORBETT			No big deal.  We just got off on			the wrong foot.  What's your			name?Eric glances down at Corbett's duffel bag, which sits on thefloor next to Corbett's tub.  Corbett's magnum rests on topof it, well within reach.  Corbett notices Eric's interestin it.  He leans back and smiles.										ERIC			Desmond.										CORBETT			New to the country, kid?										ERIC			Six months.  Ecological study for			Northland Oil.										CORBETT			Ecology.

He SCREECHES backwards to get a running start,REVS the engine, pops the clutch, and tears toward thebridge.As they reach the midpoint of the bridge it begins to buckleunder them.  With a sickening WRENCHING, the crossbarsupports crumple.The jeep flies through the still-burning gasoline, becomesairborne, and SCRAPES to a rude stop on the edge of thepavement on the other side, the back wheels dangling inspace.LeMalle and Mitchell gingerly get out and push the ass endof the jeep onto solid earth.84   INT.

ERIC			How the hell were they smart			enough to find us?										CORBETT			Smart?  Sure.  That's why I'm			sitting in this plane and they're			down there blowing me kisses.Eric retracts the landing gear and banks toward thesouthwest.  Corbett notices that Eric seems a little unsureof the controls.										CORBETT			(continuing)			Been driving long?										ERIC			I needed a pilot's license to			take the job here, so I got one			in six weeks.										CORBETT			That makes the flight more			interesting.Eric ignores the jibe.

Yeah, that one's easy;			you could glide right in...Suddenly, he turns in the seat and pins Eric against thedoor with his left foot.The plane flies erratically.  With his right foot, Corbettkicks the fuel jettison lever on the instrument panel,jamming it on.90   EXT.  CESSNA - (AERIAL SHOT)The lever, used to empty the fuel tanks in case ofemergency, does so with great expediency.  All the gas isinstantly discharged.91   INT.  CESSNA - (AERIAL SHOT)Corbett releases Eric and calmly sits back up in his seat.Eric rubs his neck, incredulous.  Corbett's move was toofast and too outrageous.  In a moment, the engine SPUTTERSto a stop.  Eric struggles to hold the stick steady andglide the plane down to the plateau Corbett pointed out.										CORBETT			Hope you got your money's worth			on those lessons.92   EXT.  CESSNA - (AERIAL SHOT)There's an even chance of hitting a mountain instead of theplateau.  Eric pushes the Cessna's nose down.

In front of him, the engine is ON FIRE.Eric undoes his seat belt and rights himself, but his leggets caught in the tangled belt.  He pulls out a Swiss Armyknife and cuts the rope binding Corbett's handcuffs to theseat.  Corbett pushes the passenger door open.  Panicking,Eric tries to pull loose of his seat belt, painfullywrenching his ankle.94   EXT.  CESSNACorbett rolls out into the snow.

ERIC			(continuing)			Last time I checked the flight			plan, we were forty miles			northeast of Devil's Cauldron.			Southwest is that way.  No sense			waiting for a goddamn taxi.Grimacing with pain, he gets up.  Clutching the magnum, heshoves Corbett in front of him and starts walking.  Corbettfrowns -- it's tough to trudge through the snow with hisarms cuffed tightly behind his back.Eric looks around and tries not to let his emotions registeron his face.  They wouldn't be farther from the rest ofhumanity on another planet.  Smelling fear on Eric, Corbettenjoys the view.  And waits.95   EXT.  ENDICOTT MOUNTAINS - LATER THAT DAYThe Endicott range is full of jagged peaks, icy streams andgnarled tundra valleys.  Squinting in the glare of the snow,Eric and Corbett trek through the grandiose Gates of theArctic area.  The smoldering plane wreckage is a hard-won,snow-covered mile behind them.Intricate patterns of fragmented rock, strips of scruffytundra and bedrock outcrops produce lonely, forebodingmosaics upon the landscape.  The air is still.  The silenceis itself a disconcerting presence.  Ten miles ahead and twothousand feet lower, the forest begins.  But here, on therock face of the mountains, Eric and Corbett might as wellbe in a desert.

CORBETT			Snow shelter.  Okay.  You dig.			I'll have a little sit-down.Corbett sits on his haunches and smiles while Eric digs nearthe rocks.  Although he knows Corbett is testing his everymove, Eric refuses to let his patronizing air get to him.										CORBETT			(continuing)			Even in the drifts, this snow's			too powdery to make a shelter.			When you're done jerking around,			reach down the back of my coat.Eric approaches him suspiciously.  He puts his hand downthrough Corbett's collar.  Something is stowed inside ahomemade flap in the lining of his coat.

Corbett takes in the scenery, in no particularhurry.  Frustrated, but making dead sure he's always got thedrop on Corbett,  Eric puts a tentative foot on the ice.										CORBETT			Ice is too thin -- you can see			the water moving underneath.										ERIC			We're not sitting here 'til			November.

Now and again he glances behind,gauging Eric's weariness, waiting for a moment'scarelessness.  Around them there is heavy vegetation now --snow-covered sedge tussocks, knee-deep muskeg and twistedthickets that are treacherous and slow to tramp through.Above them, ominous clouds and sharp, cold winds are comingdown from the north.But below, a mile ahead, the edge of the forest is like thehem of a great green garment stretching endlessly southward.The combination of altitude and latitude creates anamazingly sharp topographical dividing line.  Within a fewthousand yards, the landscape abruptly changes from scrubbrush to thick coniferous forest.										CORBETT			Better get into those trees			before that squall blows down.Then, Corbett pauses as a walloping sound ECHOES across thefoothills.Just ahead, two enormous bull moose are fighting.

Hunching againstthe wind, Eric pulls off his gloves and reaches in hispocket for some precious matches.  His fingers are so coldhe can't hold them, and he drops several in the wet snow.Angry, he shoots a look at Corbett. Corbett is holding hishands inside his coat.  He pulls them out and quickly takesthe remaining matches from Eric.Crouching down, back to the wind, Corbett grasps a matchbetween his numb fingers and awkwardly strikes it.  He holdsthe flame next to the kindling.  It doesn't catch fireimmediately.  Corbett lets the match burn out against hisfingers.  He tries another match.  This time, a flame takeshold but could succumb to the wind at any moment.On his knees and elbows, Corbett nurses along the tiny fire.Eric can't control his shivering.

She feelsaround inside the saddlebags and finds three emergency roadflares.Anne Marie IGNITES the flares.  They illuminate the areawith an eerie reddish glow.  She YELLS at the bear, wieldsthe flares like Excalibur and moves forward.The bear, reluctant to leave so hearty a pre-hibernationmeal, GROWLS and cocks its head back and forth to assess thethreat.

The bearswipes at her, its huge paw inches away.  Anne Marie jabs atthe paw with the flare, but that only makes the bear morequarrelsome.She twists around, looking for a defense.  Above her is thecabling from the generator to the circuit box for theTurtle's electrical system.  She tugs at it, but it won'tbudge.  The bear SNIFFS at Anne Marie with its big wetsnout.  Anne Marie notices warning a sign on a controlvalve:										?  DANGER!!										?  BLACK WATER										?  UNTREATED SEWAGEGrimacing, she tries to turn the valve.  After much effort,it SNAPS and opens, releasing a stream of fetid sewage.WIDERThe bear gets a muzzle full of the stuff.  HOWLINGunhappily, it backs away, GRUNTING and SNEEZING.

The flareburns out, plunging the area into darkness.Anne Marie wraps the rope around the tree trunk andnervously tries to LIGHT another flare.

Feeling that he's won, LeMalle wraps his bonyfingers around the stock of the Remington.Anne Marie closes her eyes and FIRES.  Pulling the rifleclose, LeMalle tucks and rolls and jumps to his feet.  AnneMarie FIRES again, and AGAIN.  Shot, LeMalle hobbles away,leaving a trail of blood in the snow.  Numb, Anne Marie letsher arm fall.204  EXT.  BOARDWALK NEAR WILDER'S CABINEric looks around at the sound of the shooting, fearing theworst.  He pulls Corbett off the boardwalk and they cutacross open ground toward the airstrip depot.205  INT.  HOT SPRINGS SPAKenai looks around at the messy RESULTS of LeMalle'sransacking for things to wear.  Kenai turns, startled, whenhe hears footsteps.  It's Neff and Meyerling.																(CONTINUED)205  CONTINUED:										KENAI			(disgusted)			Lookit this damn mess.  Where in			hell's Wilder?										NEFF			(after a beat)			Dead.  Trappers killed him.										KENAI			Aw, Jesus.  Told you this was			trouble.			(to Meyerling)			What about you, big shot?  Do			something.  Who's side are you			on, anyway?										MEYERLING			Hey, I thought you people loved			Corbett and his wild men!										KENAI			This shoot-'em-up shit is bad for			business.  I'm sick of it.										MEYERLING			What about you, Neff?										NEFF			Well... two of the trappers are			down already --										MEYERLING			(suddenly on the bandwagon)			-- One left; three of us.  Let's			finish it.										NEFF			What about Eric Desmond?										MEYERLING			I'll handle him.206  EXT.  YARDS BEHIND AIRSTRIP DEPOTThrough the snow, Eric can see the faint outline of theplane on the runway.  He and Corbett hurry toward the backof the airstrip depot.As they wend their way through the junk-filled yards, Ericcatches a glimpse of movement around a corner, REFLECTED ina pane of glass leaning against a roll of tar paper.																(CONTINUED)206  CONTINUED:ERIC'S POV - REFLECTIONPeacemaker in hand, Mitchell is behind the depot, comingright for them.WIDEREric takes out the homemade flashbomb.  He lights it, tossesit toward Mitchell and covers his eyes.  It EXPLODES with amuffled pop and a bright flash of white light.Mitchell stumbles backwards and blinks his eyes.  The flashhas temporarily clouded his vision.Eric moves Corbett to another approach to the depot andwaits for Mitchell to move on.207  EXT.  REAR WALL OF AIRSTRIP DEPOTMitchell is about to do just that when a hand on hisshoulder stops him.  It's LeMalle, oblivious to the profusebleeding from his right shoulder.  Mitchell blinks, stillhaving trouble seeing.  LeMalle gestures for him to be quietand points in Eric and Corbett's direction.										LEMALLE			(whispers)			Over there...He hoists his Remington.										MITCHELL			(whispers)			Hold it.  You might hit Ben.										LEMALLE			Bullshit.  I hit what I'm aiming			at.										MITCHELL			Let 'em come closer first...But LeMalle is too anxious.  He swings the rifle up,left-handed, and SHOOTS.NEW ANGLEThe bullet just misses Eric.  He panics and wildly returnsFIRE with the .357.208  EXT.  REAR WALL OF AIRSTRIP DEPOTMitchell and LeMalle scatter under the hail of bullets.																(CONTINUED)208  CONTINUED:ANGLE ON ERIC AND CORBETTas they HEAR LeMalle's labored footsteps run past them,nearby.  Eric peers cautiously around the corner toward thedepot.  There is no further movement.Eric waits a moment, then leads Corbett cautiously towardthe depot.209  EXT.  REAR WALL OF AIRSTRIP DEPOTReaching the rear wall, they practically stumble oversomething.  It's Mitchell, lying on the ground near thewall, badly wounded by Eric's barrage.  Eric gasps.Anguished, Corbett kneels next to Mitchell.  Mitchell pullshim closer.										MITCHELL			Glad to see you're okay.  I told			LeMalle not to shoot.			(tries to smile)			Had some fine seasons, didn't			we...Mitchell's grasp on Corbett's coat relaxes as he dies.Horrified, Eric stares at the man he killed.  Noticing thescrimshaw lying on the snow where it slipped from Mitchell'spocket, Corbett picks it up.										CORBETT			(to Eric)			Fifteen years on the trail with			this man, I never saw him rise to			anger.Glaring at Eric, Corbett dips his hand in Mitchell's blood,and suddenly smears it across Eric's mouth.  Repelled, Ericpulls back.										CORBETT			(continuing; bitterly)			Your first kill.  How does it			taste?Wiping his face, sickened and desolate, Eric has no reply.WIDERThen, from somewhere close by, LeMalle FIRES at them.  Ericstuffs the .357 in his belt and uses a brick to knock thepadlock off the back door of the depot.  He pushes Corbettinside.210  INT.  CARGO PLANE - COCKPITThe pony-tailed, ex-hippie PILOT shuts his engines off andremoves his Walkman headphones.  Hearing LeMalle'scontinuing GUNSHOTS, the Pilot pulls his door closed andturns on his two-way radio.										PILOT			(into radio mic)			Circle, this is BMY-955.  I just			touched down in Devil's Cauldron.			Nobody's here to greet me like			usual, and there's gunfire.  I'm			getting scarce.With that, he STARTS his engines up again.CUT TO ERIC IN DEPOTwho turns, startled, when he hears the ENGINES coughing tolife OS.211  INT.  CARGO PLANE - COCKPITThe Pilot fiddles with his controls and prepares to takeoff.  He looks up, surprised, as the passenger door suddenlyopens.WIDERAnne Marie slides onto the seat.										ANNE MARIE			You can't leave yet.										PILOT			It's my responsibility to get			this aircraft out of here safely.Anne Marie points the .44 at him.										PILOT			(continuing)			You got to be kidding.										ANNE MARIE			Leave the engines idling.  Go			back and open the side door.Shaking his head and muttering, the Pilot unfastens his seatbelt, climbs between the two seats to the cargo compartment,and obliges the little lady with the big gun.212  INT.  AIRSTRIP DEPOTThe depot, as temporary-looking as the rest of Devil'sCauldron, is a boxcar-shaped loading dock and warehouse witha corrugated steel roof.  Boxes, wood palettes and handdollies are piled haphazardly about.Eric and Corbett navigate through the piles of boxes,inching toward the front door -- the door leading to theplane.Suddenly, a string of overhead lights come on.  Eric goesfor the .357, then stops when he sees Meyerling, Kenai andNeff have come in the front door.  Kenai stomps his feet andshivers.  Grandstanding for the others, Meyerling stepsforward.										MEYERLING			Nobody wants any more killings;			we all agree to that, correct?			(no one argues)			That's good.  Now, Eric, you're			gonna hand your prisoner over to			us.										ERIC			Fuck you.										MEYERLING			This isn't your concern.  It's			over, here and now.										CORBETT			(to Meyerling)			Sure, when you put a bullet in my			back on the way out.  Easier for			all involved.										MEYERLING			Not a bad idea.  Face it, Ben.			There's no room in Alaska for you			any more.Meyerling pokes with his foot at a tipped-over rack ofEskimo paraphernalia -- masks, furs, big skin drums, fish-and bear-spears.										MEYERLING			(continuing)			You're as antiquated as this			shit.Meyerling moves toward Corbett, but Eric stands in his way.																(CONTINUED)212  CONTINUED:										ERIC			Keep back.										CORBETT			You're quite a piece of work,			Meyerling.  The tide changes, you			ride right along with it.Eric looks at Neff.										ERIC			Neff, you know better than			this...										NEFF			You're an outsider, Mr. Desmond.			Step aside; stay out of it.Kenai and Neff move in with Meyerling.  Eric stands hisground and reaches for the .357 in his belt.NEW ANGLESuddenly, LeMalle stumbles into the depot, the blankets andfurs dragging at his feet.  His right side is bathed inblood.  Half-frozen, bled dry, he looks ready to drop downdead.  In his left hand, impossibly, he still clutches themassive Remington.He hoists it to his hip and grits his teeth as he BOLTS around into the chamber with his injured right arm.  Bracinghimself, he levels the rifle at Eric.Hearing the ACTION of the rifle, Eric turns.Corbett reaches down, grabs a rusty Eskimo spear in both hishandcuffed hands, and hurls it.There is a deafening ROAR as LeMalle's rifle discharges.LeMalle flies back from the recoil -- and from the spearstuck clear through his chest.Some packing material above Eric's head smolders, ignited bythe muzzle blast.NEW ANGLEThere is a moment of silence.  Corbett looks at the otherweapons near him, and then at Meyerling.  Threatened,Meyerling pulls out a .380 automatic.  Before Eric can doanything, Meyerling FIRES.The IMPACT of the bullet throws Corbett against some boxes.																(CONTINUED)212  CONTINUED:  (2)With a YELL, Eric jumps Meyerling and rips the gun from hisgrasp.  Enraged, he pummels Meyerling with it until Kenaiand Neff pull them apart.  Eric wrenches away from them andscrambles to his feet with Meyerling's gun in his hand.										ERIC			(continuing)			Anybody moves and I'll shoot!Holding the .380 on them, Eric crosses to Corbett.  Bleedingfrom the abdomen, he's trying to stand up.										ERIC			(continuing)			Can you walk?										CORBETT			Wound's a through-and-through.			Missed my liver, I think.										ERIC			Let's get out of here.Cautiously backing away from the others, Eric helps Corbettget up and shuffle toward the OS SOUND of the cargo plane.213  EXT.  DEVIL'S CAULDRON - AIRSTRIPAnne Marie jumps down from the cockpit.  She and Eric liftCorbett into the plane.214  EXT.  CARGO PLANEas it taxis and lifts off.215  INT.  CARGO PLANE - (AERIAL SHOT)While Eric takes Corbett's handcuffs off, Anne Marie looksat his wound.  He waves her away.										ERIC			How come you didn't let him shoot			me?										CORBETT			(softly)			Like I said, I'd still be up on			that mountain, frozen solid, it			wasn't for you.										ERIC			We'll get you to a hospital, soon			as we get to Fairbanks.																(CONTINUED)215  CONTINUED:										CORBETT			So they can patch me up and put			me in a cage?  Forget it.			Meyerling's right -- I'm a			dinosaur.  Greedy bastards like			him, it's their turn with this			land.  Put me in the woods, let			me live or die on my own.He painfully pulls himself into a sitting position.										CORBETT			(continuing; peers out				window)			Look down there, tell me what any			of this matters.  Struggles of			men get swallowed by the bigness.			Soon there won't be a trace of			our troubles... or us.										ERIC			You're wrong.  Everything we do			leaves its mark.  You said it			yourself -- there are hundred-			year-old footprints in the			tundra.Too tired to argue, Corbett leans back against the window.He takes Mitchell's scrimshaw out of his pocket and looks atit.EXTREME CLOSE UP - THE SCRIMSHAWThe exquisitely beautiful and detailed engraving depicts agrizzly beside a wilderness creek, with trees and mountainsin the background.CORBETTclutches the scrimshaw in his hand and closes his eyes.NEW ANGLE - (AERIAL SHOT)Eric sighs as he looks at the blood -- Mitchell's blood --on the back of his hand.  He stares at Corbett for a longmoment.  Then, resolved, he climbs up front and sayssomething to the Pilot.  Grumbling, the Pilot adjusts hiscontrols.																		CUT TO:216  EXT.  HAUL ROAD - PUMPING STATION - DAYThe snow clouds are dissipating.  The cargo plane comes downthrough them and lands on the airstrip behind the pumpingstation.217  INT.  CARGO PLANEAs it rolls to a stop, Eric throws open the cargo door.Corbett sits up, surprised.  He and Eric exchange a longlook, then Corbett crosses to the open door and gingerlysteps down onto the snow-covered runway.218  EXT.  CARGO PLANEEric and Anne Marie watch from the door of the plane asCorbett limps across the runway toward the treeline.  As hegoes, his footprints are dusted over by the snow and wind.Corbett stops, turns and looks back at Eric, then continuesonward, disappearing into the forest.ANGLE ON CARGO PLANEEric closes the cargo door as the Pilot turns the planearound and taxis back down the runway.219  INT.  CARGO PLANE - (AERIAL SHOT)Eric wearily sits next to Anne Marie.  She kisses him.The Pilot glances over his shoulder and frowns.										PILOT			(to himself)			Too damn crazy in this state			anymore.  I'm moving back to L.A.220  INT.  CARGO PLANE - ANGLE THROUGH WINDOW - (AERIAL SHOT)The plane climbs above the fog and snow clouds into a sunny,ice blue sky.  It banks and turns south.  Behind it, themountains roll on toward the Arctic wasteland, forever.
