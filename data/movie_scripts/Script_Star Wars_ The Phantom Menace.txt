The vendor suddenlyappears.VENDOR : Hey, that will be seven truguts!!JAR JAR opens his mouth in surprise, and the frog snaps away, ricochetsaround the market, and lands in Sebulba's soup, splashing him.

The weaponson your fighters may not penetrate the shields on the control ship.OBI-WAN : And there's an even bigger danger. If the Vicroy escapes, YourHighness, he will return with another droid army.PADME : That is why we must not fail to get to the Viceroy. Everythingdepends on it.INT.

The two Jedi may beusing the Queen for their own purposes.DARTH SIDIOUS : The Jedi cannot become involved. They can only protect theQueen. Even Qui-Gon Jinn will not break that conenant....
