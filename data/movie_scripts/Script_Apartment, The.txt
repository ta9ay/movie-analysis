                     THE APARTMENT                           by            Billy Wilder and I.A.L. Diamond                        THE APARTMENTA DESK COMPUTERA man's hand is punching out a series of figures on thekeyboard.                         BUD (V.O.)            On November first, 1959, the            population of New York City was            8,042,783.  if you laid all these            people end to end, figuring an            average height of five feet six and            a half inches, they would reach            from Times Square to the outskirts            of Karachi, Pakistan.  I know facts            like this because I work for an            insurance company --THE INSURANCE BUILDING - A WET, FALL DAYIt's a big mother, covering a square block in lowerManhattan, all glass and aluminum, jutting into the leadensky.                         BUD (V.O.)            -- Consolidated Life of New York.            We are one of the top five companies            in the country -- last year we            wrote nine-point-three billion            dollars worth of policies.  Our            home office has 31,259 employees --            which is more than the entire            population of Natchez, Mississippi,            of Gallup, New Mexico.INT. NINETEENTH FLOORAcres of gray steel desk, gray steel filing cabinets, andsteel-gray faces under indirect light.  One wall is linedwith glass-enclosed cubicles for the supervisory personnel.It is all very neat, antiseptic, impersonal.  The only humantough is supplied by a bank of IBM machines, clacking awaycheerfully in the background.                         BUD (V.O.)            I work on the nineteenth floor --            Ordinary Policy Department -            Premium Accounting Division -            Section W -- desk number 861.DESK 861Like every other desk, it has a small name plate attached tothe side.  This one reads C.C. BAXTER.                         BUD (V.O.)            My name is C.C. Baxter - C. for            Calvin, C. for Clifford -- however,            most people call me Bud. I've been            with Consolidated Life for three            years and ten months.  I started in            the branch office in Cincinnati,            then transferred to New York.  My            take-home pay is $94.70 a week, and            there are the usual fringe benefits.BAXTER is about thirty, serious, hard-working, unobtrusive.He wears a Brooks Brothers type suit, which he boughtsomewhere on Seventh Avenue, upstairs.  There is a stack ofperforated premium cards in front of him, and he is totalingthem on the computing machine.  He looks off.ELECTRIC WALL CLOCKIt shows 5:19.  With a click, the minute hand jumps to 5:20,and a piercing bell goes off.                         BUD (V.O.)            The hours in our department are            8:50 to 5:20 --FULL SHOT - OFFICEInstantly all work stops.  Papers are being put away,typewriters and computing machines are covered, and everybodystarts clearing out.  Within ten seconds, the place isempty -- except for Bud Baxter, still bent over his work,marooned in a sea of abandoned desks.                         BUD (V.O.)            -- they're staggered by floors, so            that sixteen elevators can handle            the 31,259 employees without a            serious traffic jam.  As for            myself, I very often stay on at the            office and work for an extra hour            or two -- especially when the            weather is bad.  It's not that I'm            overly ambitious -- it's just a way            of killing time, until it's all            right for me to go home.            You see, I have this little problem            with my apartment --                                            DISSOLVE TO:STREET IN THE WEST SIXTIES - EVENINGBud, wearing a weather-beaten Ivy League raincoat and anarrow-brimmed brown hat, comes walking slowly down thestreet skirting the puddles on the sidewalk.  He stops infront of a converted brownstone, looks up.                         BUD (V.O.)            I live in the West Sixties - just            half a block from Central Park.  My            rent is $84 a month.  It used to be            eighty until last July when Mrs.            Lieberman, the landlady, put in a            second-hand air conditioning unit.The windows on the second floor are lit, but the shades aredrawn.  From inside drifts the sound of cha cha music.                         BUD (V.O.)            It's a real nice apartment -            nothing fancy -- but kind of            cozy -- just right for a bachelor.            The only problem is - I can't            always get in when I want to.INT. THE APARTMENT - EVENINGWhat used to be the upstairs parlor of a one-family house inthe early 1900's has been chopped up into living room,bedroom, bathroom and kitchen.  The wallpaper is faded, thecarpets are threadbare, and the upholstered furniture couldstand shampooing.  There are lots of books, a record player,stacks of records, a television set (21 inches and 24payments), unframed prints from the Museum of Modern Art(Picasso, Braque, Klee) tacked up on the walls.Only one lamp is lit, for mood, and a cha cha record isspinning around on the phonograph.  On the coffee table infront of the couch are a couple of cocktail glasses, apitcher with some martini dregs, an almost empty bottle ofvodka, a soup bowl with a few melting ice cubes at thebottom, some potato chips, an ashtray filled with cigarstubs and lipstick-stained cigarette butts, and a woman'shandbag.MR. KIRKEBY, a dapper, middle-aged man, stands in front ofthe mirror above the fake fireplace, buttoning up his vest.He does not notice that the buttons are out of alignment.                         KIRKEBY                   (calling off)            Come on, Sylvia.  It's getting late.SYLVIA, a first baseman of a dame, redheaded and saftig,comes cha cha-ing into the room, trying to fasten a necklaceas she hums along with the music.  She dances amorously upto Kirkeby.                         KIRKEBY            Cut it out, Sylvia.  We got to get            out of here.He helps her with the necklace, then turns off the phonograph.                         SYLVIA            What's the panic?  I'm going to            have another martooni.She crosses to the coffee table, starts to pour the remnantsof the vodka into the pitcher.                         KIRKEBY            Please, Sylvia!  It's a quarter to            nine!                         SYLVIA                   (dropping slivers of                   ice into the pitcher)            First you can't wait to get me up            here, and now -- rush, rush, rush!            Makes a person feel cheap.                         KIRKEBY            Sylvia -- sweetie -- it's not            that -- but I promised the guy I'd            be out of here by eight o'clock,            positively.                         SYLVIA                   (pouring martini)            What guy?  Whose apartment is this,            anyway?                         KIRKEBY                   (exasperated)            What's the difference?  Some            schnook that works in the office.EXT. BROWNSTONE HOUSE - EVENINGBud is pacing back and forth, throwing an occasional glanceat the lit windows of his apartment.  A middle-aged womanwith a dog on a leash approaches along the sidewalk.She is MRS. LIEBERMAN, the dog is a Scottie, and they areboth wearing raincoats.  Seeing them, Bud leans casuallyagainst the stoop.                         MRS. LIEBERMAN            Good evening, Mr. Baxter.                         BUD            Good evening, Mrs. Lieberman.                         MRS. LIEBERMAN            Some weather we're having.  Must be            from all the meshugass at Cape            Canaveral.                   (she is half-way up                   the steps)            You locked out of your apartment?                         BUD            No, no.  Just waiting for a friend.            Good night, Mrs. Lieberman.                         MRS. LIEBERMAN            Good night, Mr. Baxter.She and the Scottie disappear into the house.  Bud resumespacing, his eyes on the apartment windows.  Suddenly hestops -- the lights have gone out.INT. SECOND FLOOR LANDING - EVENINGKirkeby, in coat and hat, stands in the open doorway of thedarkened apartment.                         KIRKEBY            Come on -- come on, Sylvia!Sylvia comes cha cha-ing out, wearing an imitation Persianlamb coat, her hat askew on her head, bag, gloves, and anumbrella in her hand.                         SYLVIA            Some setup you got here.  A real,            honest-to-goodness love nest.                         KIRKEBY            Sssssh.He locks the door, slips the key under the doormat.                         SYLVIA                   (still cha cha-ing)            You're one button off, Mr. Kirkeby.She points to his exposed vest.  Kirkeby looks down, seesthat the buttons are out of line.  He starts to rebuttonthem as they move down the narrow, dimly-lit stairs.                         SYLVIA            You got to watch those things.            Wives are getting smarter all the            time.  Take Mr. Bernheim -- in the            Claims Department -- came home one            night with lipstick on his shirt --            told his wife he had a shrimp            cocktail for lunch -- so she took            it out to the lab and had it            analyzed -- so now she has the            house in Great Neck and the children            and the new Jaguar --                         KIRKEBY            Don't you ever stop talking?EXT. BROWNSTONE HOUSE - EVENINGBud, standing on the sidewalk, sees the front door start toopen.  He moves quickly into the areaway, almost bumpinginto the ashcans, stands in the shadow of the stoop with hisback turned discreetly toward Kirkeby and Sylvia as theycome down the steps.                         KIRKEBY            Where do you live?                         SYLVIA            I told you -- with my mother.                         KIRKEBY            Where does she live?                         SYLVIA            A hundred and seventy-ninth            street -- the Bronx.                         KIRKEBY            All right -- I'll take you to the            subway.                         SYLVIA            Like hell you will.  You'll buy me            a cab.                         KIRKEBY            Why do all you dames have to live            in the Bronx?                         SYLVIA            You mean you bring other girls up            here?                         KIRKEBY            Certainly not.  I'm a happily            married man.They move down the street.  Bud appears from the areaway,glances after them, then mounts the steps, goes through thefront door.INT. VESTIBULE - EVENINGThere are eight mailboxes.  Bud opens his, takes out amagazine in a paper wrapper and a few letters, proceeds upthe staircase.INT. SECOND FLOOR LANDING - EVENINGBud, glancing through his mail, comes up to the door of hisapartment.  As he bends down to lift the doormat, the doorof the rear apartment opens and MRS. DREYFUSS, a jovialwell-fed middle-aged woman, puts out a receptacle full ofold papers and empty cans.  Bud looks around from his bentposition.                         BUD            Oh.  Hello there, Mrs. Dreyfuss.                         MRS. DREYFUSS            Something the matter?                         BUD            I seem to have dropped my key.                   (faking a little search)            Oh -- here it is.He slides it out from under the mat, straightens up.                         MRS. DREYFUSS            Such a racket I heard in your            place -- maybe you had burglars.                         BUD            Oh, you don't have to worry about            that -- nothing in there that            anybody would want to steal...                   (unlocking door quickly)            Good night, Mrs. Dreyfuss.He ducks into the apartment.INT. THE APARTMENT - EVENINGBud snaps on the lights, drops the mail and the key on asmall table, looks around with distaste at the mess hisvisitors have left behind.  He sniffs the stale air, crossesto the window, pulls up the shade, opens it wide.  Now hetakes off his hat and raincoat, gathers up the remains ofthe cocktail party from the coffee table.  Loaded down withglasses, pitcher, empty vodka bottle, ice bowl and potatochips, he starts toward the kitchen.The doorbell rings.  Bud stops, undecided what to do withthe stuff in his hands, then crosses to the hall door,barely manages to get it open.  Mr. Kirkeby barges in pasthim.                         KIRKEBY            The little lady forgot her galoshes.He scours the room for the missing galoshes.                         BUD            Mr. Kirkeby, I don't like to            complain -- but you were supposed            to be out of here by eight.                         KIRKEBY            I know, Buddy-boy, I know.  But            those things don't always run on            schedule -- like a Greyhound bus.                         BUD            I don't mind in the summer -- but            on a rainy night -- and I haven't            had any dinner yet --                         KIRKEBY            Sure, sure.  Look, kid -- I put in            a good word for you with Sheldrake,            in Personnel.                         BUD                   (perking up)            Mr. Sheldrake?                         KIRKEBY            That's right.  We were discussing            our department -- manpower-wise --            and promotion-wise --                   (finds the galoshes                   behind a chair)            -- and I told him what a bright boy            you were.  They're always on the            lookout for young executives.                         BUD            Thank you, Mr. Kirkeby.                         KIRKEBY                   (starting toward door)            You're on your way up, Buddy-boy.            And you're practically out of liquor.                         BUD            I know.  Mr. Eichelberger -- in the            Mortgage Loan Department -- last            night he had a little Halloween            party here --                         KIRKEBY            Well, lay in some vodka and some            vermouth -- and put my name on it.                         BUD            Yes, Mr. Kirkeby.  You still owe me            for the last two bottles --                         KIRKEBY            I'll pay you on Friday.

BUD                   (making a mental note)            Cheese crackers.He carries his load into the kitchen.The kitchen is minute and cluttered.  On the drainboard arean empty vermouth bottle, some ice-cube trays, a jar withone olive in it, and a crumpled potato-chip bag.Bud comes in, dumps his load on the drainboard, opens theold-fashioned refrigerator.  He takes out a frozen chickendinner, turns the oven on, lights it with a match, rips theprotective paper off the aluminum tray and shoves it in.Now he starts to clean up the mess on the drainboard.  Herinses the cocktail glasses, is about to empty the martinipitcher into the sink, thinks better of it.  He pours thecontents into a glass, plops the lone olive out of the jar,scoops up the last handful of potato chips, toasts animaginary companion, and drinks up.  Then he pulls awastebasket from under the sink.It is brimful of liquor bottles, and Bud adds the emptyvodka and vermouth bottles and the olive jar.  Picking upthe heavy receptacle, he carries it through the living roomtoward the hall door.INT. SECOND FLOOR LANDING - EVENINGThe door of Bud's apartment opens, and Bud comes out withthe wastebasket full of empty bottles.  Just then, DR.

Some clown at Schrafft's            57th Street ate a club sandwich,            and forgot to take out the toothpick.                         BUD            Oh.

BUD            Oh, that's not me.  It's just that            once in a while, I have some people            in for a drink.                         DR. DREYFUSS            As a matter of fact, you must be an            iron man all around.

THE APARTMENT - EVENINGBud, loosening his tie, goes into the kitchen, opens theoven, turns off the gas.  He takes a coke out of therefrigerator, uncaps it, gets a knife and fork from adrawer, and using his handkerchief as a potholder, pulls thehot aluminum tray out of the oven.  He carries everythingout into the living room.In the living room, Bud sets his dinner down on the coffeetable, settles himself on the couch.  He rears up assomething stabs him, reaches under his buttocks, pulls out ahairpin.  He drops it into an ashtray, tackles his dinner.Without even looking, he reaches over to the end table andpresses the remote TV station-selector.  He takes a sip fromthe coke bottle, his eyes on the TV screen across the room.The picture on the TV set jells quickly.  Against abackground of crisscrossing searchlights, a pompous announceris making his spiel.                         ANNOUNCER            -- from the world's greatest            library of film classics, we            proudly present --                   (fanfare)            Greta Garbo -- John Barrymore --            Joan Crawford -- Wallace Beery --            and Lionel Barrymore in --                   (fanfare)            GRAND HOTEL!There is an extended fanfare.  Bud leans forward, chewingexcitedly on a chicken leg.                         ANNOUNCER            But first, a word from our sponsor.            If you smoke the modern way, don't            be fooled by phony filter claims --Bud, still eating, automatically reaches for the station-selector, pushes the button.A new channel pops on.  It features a Western -- CockamamieIndians are attacking a stagecoach.That's not for Bud.  He switches to another station.  In afrontier saloon, Gower Street cowboys are dismantling thefurniture and each other.Bud wearily changes channels.  But he can't get away fromWesterns -- on this station, the U.S. Cavalry is riding tothe rescue.  Will they get there in time?Bud doesn't wait to find out.  He switches channels again,and is back where he started.On the screen, once more, is the announcer standing in frontof the crisscrossing searchlights.                         ANNOUNCER            And now, Grand Hotel -- starring            Greta Garbo, John Barrymore, Joan            Crawford --                   (Bud is all eyes and                   ears again)            -- Wallace Beery, and Lionel            Barrymore.  But first -- a word            from our alternate sponsor.                   (unctuously)            Friends, do you have wobbly            dentures -- ?That does it.  Bud turns the set off in disgust.The TV screen blacks out, except for a small pinpoint oflight in the center, which gradually fades away.In the bathroom, Bud, in pajamas by now, is brushing histeeth.  From the shower rod hang three pairs of socks onstretchers.  Bud takes a vial from the medicine shelf,shakes out a sleeping pill, washes it down with a glass ofwater.  He turns the light off, walks into the bedroom.In the bedroom, the single bed is made, and the lamp on thenight table is on.  Bud plugs in the electric blanket, turnsthe dial on.  Then he climbs into bed, props up the pillowbehind him.  From the night table, he picks up the magazinethat arrived in the mail, slides it out of the wrapper,opens it.  It's the new issue of PLAYBOY.  Bud leafs throughit till he comes to the piece de resistance of the magazine.He unfolds the overleaf, glances at it casually, refolds it,then turns to the back of the magazine and starts to read.What he is so avidly interested in is the men's fashionsection.  There is a layout titled WHAT THE YOUNG EXECUTIVEWILL WEAR with a sub-head reading The Bowler is Back.Illustrating the article are several photographs of malemodels wearing various styles of bowlers.Bud is definitely in the market for a bowler, but somehowhis mind starts wandering.  He turns back to the overleafagain, unfolds it, studies it, then holds the magazine upvertically to get a different perspective on the subject.By now the sleeping pill is beginning to take effect, and heyawns.  He drops the magazine on the floor, kills the light,settles down to sleep.  The room is dark except for the glowfrom the dial of the electric blanket.Three seconds.  Then the phone jangles shrilly in the livingroom.  Bud stumbles groggily out of bed, and putting on hisslippers, makes his way into the living room.  He switcheson the light, picks up the phone.                         BUD            Hello? -- Hello? -- yes, this is            Baxter.INT.

He picks up a pad and pencil from thetable, prints something in block letters.  Tearing off thetop sheet, he impales it on the spindle of the phonograph,then walks out, closing the door behind him.  The note reads:                        NOT TOO LOUD                THE NEIGHBORS ARE COMPLAININGEXT.

Bud ducks discreetly intothe areaway.  Mr. Dobisch, bareheaded, emerges cautiouslyfrom the cab.  Between the fingers of his hands he iscarrying four long-stemmed glasses, brimful of stingers.The blonde steps out, holding his hat.                         BLONDE            This the place?                         DOBISCH            Yeah.                   (to cab driver)            How much?

DOBISCH            Get the money, will you?The blonde plants the hat on top of his head, unbuttons hisovercoat, reaches into his pants pocket.  As she does so,she jogs his elbow.                         DOBISCH            Watch those stingers!The blonde has taken out Dobisch's money clip, with about ahundred dollars in it.                         DOBISCH            Give him a buck.The blonde peels a bill off, hands it to the cabbie, hangson to the rest of the roll just a second too long.

BLONDE                   (holding door open                   for him)            I mean - barging in on your            mother -- in the middle of the night?                         DOBISCH                   (edging past her with stingers)            Don't worry about the old lady.            One squawk from her, and she's out            of a job.In the areaway, Bud has overheard them, and it doesn't makehim any happier.  He steps out on the sidewalk, shufflesdown the street.INT. SECOND FLOOR LANDING - NIGHTThe blonde and Dobisch, his hands full of stingers, come upto Bud's door.

Then the door of therear apartment opens, and Dr. Dreyfuss, in a beaten bathrobe,sets out a couple of empty milk bottles with a note in them.Suddenly, from Bud's apartment, comes a shrill female giggle.Dr. Dreyfuss reacts.  Then the cha cha music starts fullblast.                         DR.

CENTRAL PARK - NIGHTBud, in raincoat and slippered feet, turns in off thestreet, plods along a path in the deserted park.  He stopsat a damp bench under a lamp post, sits.  In the background,lights shine from the towering buildings on Central ParkSouth.Bud huddles inside his raincoat, shivering.  He is verysleepy by now.  His eyes close and his head droops.  A gustof wind sends wet leaves swirling across the bench.  Buddoesn't stir.  He is all in.                                            FADE OUT.FADE IN:INT. LOBBY INSURANCE BUILDING - DAYIt's a quarter to nine of a gray November morning, and work-bound employees are piling in through the doors.  Among themis Bud, bundled up in a raincoat, hat, heavy muffler andwool gloves, and carrying a box of Kleenex.  He coughs,pulls out a tissue, wipes his dripping nose.  He has a badcold.The lobby is an imposing, marbled affair, as befits acompany which last year wrote 9.3 billion dollars worth ofinsurance.  There are sixteen elevators, eight of themmarked LOCAL - FLOORS 1-18, and opposite them eight markedEXPRESS - FLOORS 18-37.  The starter, a uniformed Valkyriewielding a clicker, is directing the flow of traffic intothe various elevators.Bud joins the crowd in front of one of the express elevators.Also standing there is Mr. Kirkeby, reading the Herald-Tribune.

Maybeit's the way she's put together, maybe it's her face, ormaybe it's just the uniform -- in any case, there issomething very appealing about her.  She is also anindividualist -- she wears a carnation in her lapel, whichis strictly against regulations.  As the elevator loads, shegreets the passengers cheerfully.

Little Lord            Fauntleroy!Leaving Bud at the employees' coat-racks, Kirkeby headstoward his office, one of the glass-enclosed cubicles.  Budhangs up his hat and raincoat, stows away the gloves andmuffler.  Out of his coat pocket he takes a plastic anti-histamine sprayer and a box of cough drops, and stillcarrying the Kleenex, threads his way to his desk.  Most ofthe desks are already occupied, and the others are fillingrapidly.Once seated at his desk, Bud arranges his medicaments neatlyin front of him. He takes a Kleenex out of the box, blowshis nose, then leaning back in his swivel chair sprays firstone nostril, then the other. Suddenly the piercing bell goesoff -- the workday has begun. Being the ultra-conscientioustype, Bud instantly sits upright in his chair, removes thecover from his computing machine, picks up a batch ofperforated premium cards, starts entering figures on hiscomputer.After a few seconds, he glances around to make sure thateverybody in the vicinity is busy. Then he looks up a numberin the company telephone directory, dials furtively.

You see, my            little friend, she kept insisting            Picasso was a bum -- so she started            to do that mural -- but I'm sure it            will wash off -- just eyebrow pencil.BUD - ON PHONE                         BUD            It's not Picasso I'm calling about.

It is warm. Clipped to hishandkerchief pocket are a black fountain pen and, next toit, a thermometer in a black case. Bud unclips thethermometer case, unscrews the cap, shakes the thermometerout, puts it under his tongue. He resumes work.A messenger comes up to his desk with an interoffice envelope.                         MESSENGER            From Mr. Dobisch.

It'sworse than he thought. He puts the thermometer back in thecase, clips it to his pocket, takes his desk calendar out ofa drawer, turns a leaf.

SHELDRAKE                   (studying him)            I was sort of wondering what you            looked like. Sit down.                         BUD            Yes, Mr. Sheldrake.He seats himself on the very edge of the leather armchairfacing Sheldrake.                         SHELDRAKE            Been hearing some very nice things            about you -- here's a report from            Mr. Dobisch -- loyal, cooperative,            resourceful --                         BUD            Mr. Dobisch said that?                         SHELDRAKE            And Mr. Kirkeby tells me that            several nights a week you work late            at the office -- without overtime.                         BUD                   (modestly)            Well, you know how it is -- things            pile up.                         SHELDRAKE            Mr. Vanderhof, in Public Relations,            and Mr. Eichelberger, in Mortgage            and Loan -- they'd both like to            have you transferred to their            departments.                         BUD            That's very flattering.Sheldrake puts the report down, takes off his glasses, leansacross the desk toward Bud.                         SHELDRAKE            Tell me, Baxter -- just what is it            that makes you so popular?                         BUD            I don't know.                         SHELDRAKE            Think.Bud does so. For a moment, he is a picture of intenseconcentration. Then --                         BUD            Would you mind repeating the            question?                         SHELDRAKE            Look, Baxter, I'm not stupid. I            know everything that goes on in            this building -- in every            department -- on every floor --            every day of the year.                         BUD                   (in a very small voice)            You do?                         SHELDRAKE                   (rises, starts pacing)            In 1957, we had an employee here,            name of Fowler. He was very popular,            too. Turned out he was running a            bookie joint right in the Actuarial            Department tying up the switchboard,            figuring the odds on our I.B.M.            machines -- so the day before the            Kentucky Derby, I called in the            Vice Squad and we raided the            thirteenth floor.                         BUD                   (worried)            The Vice Squad?                         SHELDRAKE            That's right, Baxter.                         BUD            What -- what's that got to do with            me? I'm not running any bookie joint.

But if you'd just let me explain --                         SHELDRAKE            You better.                         BUD                   (a deep breath)            Well, about six months ago -- I was            going to night school, taking this            course in Advanced Accounting --            and one of the guys in our            department -- he lives in Jersey --            he was going to a banquet at the            Biltmore -- his wife was meeting            him in town, and he needed someplace            to change into a tuxedo -- so I            gave him the key    and word must            have gotten around -- because the            next thing I knew, all sorts of            guys were suddenly going to            banquets -- and when you give the            key to one guy, you can't say no to            another and the whole thing got out            of hand -- pardon me.He whips out the nasal-spray, administers a couple of quicksquirts up each nostril.

He crosses to the clothes-tree,removes his hat and coat, hangs them up. From OFF comes --                         KIRKEBY'S VOICE            Hi, Buddy-boy.                         DOBISCH'S VOICE            Congratulations, and all that jazz.Bud turns. Kirkeby, Dobisch, Eichelberger and Vanderhof havecome into the office.                         BUD            Hi, fellas.                         EICHELBERGER            Well, you made it, kid -- just like            we promised.                         VANDERHOF            Quite an office -- name on the            door -- rug on the floor -- the            whole schmear.                         BUD            Yeah.                         DOBISCH            Teamwork -- that's what counts in            an organization like this. All for            one and one for all -- know what I            mean?                         BUD            I have a vague idea.Kirkeby signals to Vanderhof, who shuts the door. The fourcharter members of the club start closing in on Bud.                         KIRKEBY            Baxter, we're a little disappointed            in you -- gratitude-wise.                         BUD            Oh, I'm very grateful.                         EIGHELBERGER            Then why are you locking us out,            all of a sudden?                         BUD            It's been sort of rough these last            few weeks -- what with my cold and            like that --He has picked up the desk calendar, shoves it discreetlyinto one of the drawers.                         DOBISCH            We went to bat for you -- and now            you won't play ball with us.                         BUD            Well, after all, it's my            apartment -- it's private            property -- it's not a public            playground.                         VANDERHOF            All right, so you got yourself a            girl -- that's okay with us -- but            not every night of the week.                         KIRKEBY            How selfish can you get?                   (to the others)            Last week I had to borrow my            nephew's car and take Sylvia to a            drive-in in Jersey. I'm too old for            that sort of thing -- I mean, in a            Volkswagen.                         BUD            I sympathize with your problem --            and believe me, I'm very sorry --                         DOBISCH            You'll be a lot sorrier before            we're through with you.                         BUD            You threatening me?                         DOBISCH            Listen, Baxter, we made you and we            can break you.He deliberately flips a cigar ash on Bud's desk. At the sametime, the door opens, and Sheldrake comes striding in briskly.                         BUD            Good morning, Mr. Sheldrake.The others swivel around.                         SHELDRAKE            Morning, gentlemen.                   (to Bud)            Everything satisfactory? You like            your office?                         BUD            Oh, yes, sir. Very much. And I want            to thank you --                         SHELDRAKE            Don't thank me -- thank your            friends here -- they're the ones            who recommended you.The four friends manage to work up some sickly smiles.                         DOBISCH            We just dropped in to wish him the            best.                   (quickly brushes                   cigar ash off desk)                         KIRKEBY                   (as they move toward                   the door)            So long, Baxter. We know you won't            let us down.                         BUD            So long, fellas. Drop in any time.            The door is always open -- to my            office.They leave. Sheldrake and Bud are alone.                         SHELDRAKE            I like the way you handled that.            Well, how does it feel to be an            executive?                         BUD            Fine. And I want you to know I'll            work very hard to justify your            confidence in me --                         SHELDRAKE            Sure you will.                   (a beat)            Say, Baxter, about the apartment -            now that you got a raise, don't you            think we can afford a second key?                         BUD            Well -- I guess so.                         SHELDRAKE            You know my secretary -- Miss            Olsen --                         BUD            Oh, yes. Very attractive. Is she --            the lucky one?                         SHELDRAKE            No, you don't understand. She's a            busybody -- always poking her nose            into things -- and with that key            passing back and forth -- why take            chances?                         BUD            Yes, sir. You can't be too careful.He glances toward the glass partitions to make sure thatnobody is watching.                         BUD            I have something here -- I think it            belongs to you.Out of his pocket he has slipped the compact with the fleur-de-lis pattern we saw Fran use at the Rickshaw. He holds itout to Sheldrake.                         SHELDRAKE            To me?                         BUD            I mean -- the young lady -- whoever            she may be -- it was on the couch            when I got home last night.                         SHELDRAKE            Oh, yes. Thanks.                         BUD            The mirror is broken.                   (opens compact,                   revealing crack in mirror)            It was broken when I found it.                         SHELDRAKE            So it was.                   (takes the compact)            She threw it at me.                         BUD            Sir?                         SHELDRAKE            You know how it is -- sooner or            later they all give you a bad time.                         BUD                   (man-of-the-world)            I know how it is.                         SHELDRAKE            You see a girl a couple of times a            week -- just for laughs -- and            right away she thinks you're going            to divorce your wife. I ask you --            is that fair?                         BUD            No, sir. That's very unfair --            especially to your wife.                         SHELDRAKE            Yeah.                   (shifting gears)            You know, Baxter, I envy you.            Bachelor -- all the dames you            want -- no headaches, no            complications --                         BUD            Yes, sir. That's the life, all right.                         SHELDRAKE            Put me down for Thursday again.                         BUD            Roger. And I'll get that other key.Sheldrake exits. Bud takes the calendar out of the deskdrawer, makes an entry.

The other girls immediately abandontheir posts, and dash after her.INT. NINETEENTH FLOOR - DAYIt's a swinging party, all right. Nobody is working. Severaldesks have been cleared and pushed together, and on top ofthis improvised stage four female employees and Mr. Dobisch,with his pants-legs rolled up, are doing a Rockette kickroutine to the tune of JINGLE BELLS. Employees are ringedaround the performers, some drinking out of paper cups,others singing and clapping in rhythm.One of the cubicles has been transformed into a bar, and itis jammed with people. Mr. Kirkeby and Mr. Vanderhof arepouring -- each has a couple of bottles of liquor in hishands, and is emptying them into the open top of a water-cooler.But the stuff is flowing out as fast as it flows in --everybody is in line with a paper cup waiting for a refill.Bud comes shouldering his way out of the crowded cubicle,holding aloft two paper cups filled with booze. Since hispromotion he has bought himself a new suit, dark flannel,and with it he wears a white shirt with a pinned roundcollar, and a foulard tie. He also has quite a glow on.Detouring past necking couples, he heads in the direction ofthe elevators.The doors of Fran's elevator are just opening, and theswitchboard operators, led by Sylvia, come streaming out.                         SYLVIA                   (to a colleague)            -- so I said to him: Never again! --            either get yourself a bigger car or            a smaller girl --As they head for the party, they pass Bud, who is approachingthe elevator with the two drinks. Fran is just closing theelevator doors.                         BUD            Miss Kubelik.The doors slide open again, and Fran looks out. Instead ofthe customary carnation in the lapel of her uniform, shewears a sprig of holly.                         BUD                   (holding out one of                   the drinks)            Marry Christmas.                         FRAN            Thank you.                   (takes drink)            I thought you were avoiding me.                         BUD            What gave you that idea?                         FRAN            In the last six weeks you've only            been in my elevator once -- and            then you didn't take your hat off.                         BUD            Well, as a matter of fact, I was            rather hurt when you stood me up            that night --                         FRAN            I don't blame you. It was            unforgivable.                         BUD            I forgive you.                         FRAN            You shouldn't.                         BUD            You couldn't help yourself. I mean,            when you're having a drink with one            man, you can't just suddenly walk            out on him because you have another            date with another man. You did the            only decent thing.                         FRAN            Don't be too sure. Just because I            wear a uniform -- that doesn't make            me a Girl Scout.                         BUD            Miss Kubelik, one doesn't get to be            a second administrative assistant            around here unless he's a pretty            good judge of character -- and as            far as I'm concerned, you're tops.            I mean, decency-wise -- and            otherwise-wise.                   (toasting)            Cheers.                         FRAN            Cheers.They down their drinks.

FRAN                   (indicating elevator)            I shouldn't drink when I'm driving.

Later on            there will be human sacrifices --            white collar workers tossed into            the computing machines, and punched            full of those little square holes.                         FRAN            How many of those drinks did you            have?                         BUD                   (holding up four fingers)            Three.                         FRAN            I thought so.They have now reached the entrance to the bar, which isoverflowing with thirsty natives.                         BUD            You wait here. I think I hear the            sound of running water.He leaves her outside the cubicle, and elbows his waythrough the crowd toward the booze-filled water cooler. Outof another cubicle comes Miss Olsen, cup in hand. She toohas had quite a few. Seeing Fran, she walks up to her, withan acid smile on her face.                         MISS OLSEN            Hi.

MISS OLSEN            So you don't have to play innocent            with me. He used to tell his wife            that I was the branch manager from            Seattle -- four years ago when we            were having a little ring-a-ding-            ding.

MISS OLSEN                   (holding her by the arm)            What for? You haven't done            anything -- it's him -- what a            salesman -- always the last booth            in the Chinese restaurant -- and            the same pitch about divorcing his            wife -- and in the end you wind up            with egg foo yong on your face.Bud comes burrowing out of the crowded cubicle, balancingthe two filled paper cups, spots Fran.

BAXTER'S OFFICE - DAYBud ushers Fran in, and is confronted by a strange couplenecking in the corner. He gestures them out, crosses to hisdesk.                         BUD            Miss Kubelik, I would like your            honest opinion. I've had this in my            desk for a week -- cost me fifteen            dollars -- but I just couldn't get            up enough nerve to wear it --From under the desk he has produced a hatbox, and out of thehatbox a black bowler, which he now puts on his head.                         BUD            It's what they call the junior            executive model. What do you think?Fran looks at him blankly, absorbed in her own thoughts.                         BUD            Guess I made a boo-boo, huh?                         FRAN                   (paying attention again)            No -- I like it.                         BUD            Really? You mean you wouldn't be            ashamed to be seen with somebody in            a hat like this?                         FRAN            Of course not.                         BUD            Maybe if I wore it a little more to            the side --                   (adjusting hat)            is that better?                         FRAN            Much better.                         BUD            Well, as long as you wouldn't be            ashamed to be seen with me -- how            about the three of us going out            this evening -- you and me and the            bowler -- stroll down Fifth            Avenue -- sort of break it in --                         FRAN            This is a bad day for me.                         BUD            I understand. Christmas -- family            and all that --                         FRAN            I'd better get back to my elevator.            I don't want to be fired.                         BUD            Oh, you don't have to worry about            that. I have quite a bit of            influence in Personnel. You know Mr.            Sheldrake?                         FRAN                   (guardedly)            Why?                         BUD            He and I are like this.                   (crosses his fingers)            Sent me a Christmas card. See?He has picked up a Christmas card from his desk, shows it toFran. It is a photograph of the Sheldrake clan groupedaround an elaborate Christmas tree -- Mr. and Mrs.Sheldrake, the two boys in military school uniforms, and abig French poodle. Underneath it says:                     SEASON'S GREETINGS                     from the SHELDRAKES                Emily, Jeff, Tommy, Jeff Jr.,                         and Figaro.                         FRAN                   (studying the card ruefully)            Makes a cute picture.                         BUD            I thought maybe I could put in a            word for you with Mr. Sheldrake --            get you a little promotion -- how            would you like to be an elevator            starter?                         FRAN            I'm afraid there are too many other            girls around here with seniority            over me.                         BUD            No problem. Why don't we discuss it            sometime over the holidays -- I            could call you and pick you up and            we'll have the big unveiling --                   (touching the brim of                   his bowler)            -- you sure this is the right way            to wear it?                         FRAN            I think so.                         BUD            You don't think it's tilted a            little too much --Fran takes her compact out of her uniform pocket, opens it,hands it to Bud.                         FRAN            Here.                         BUD                   (examining himself in                   the mirror)            After all, this is a conservative            firm -- I don't want people to            think I'm an entertainer --His voice trails off. There is something familiar about thecracked mirror of the compact -- and the fleur-de-lispattern on the case confirms his suspicion. Fran notices thepeculiar expression on his face.                         FRAN            What is it?                         BUD                   (with difficulty)            The mirror -- it's broken.                         FRAN            I know. I like it this way -- makes            me look the way I feel.The phone has started to ring. Bud doesn't hear it. Hecloses the compact, hands it to Fran.                         FRAN            Your phone.                         BUD            Oh.                   (picks up phone from desk)            Yes?                   (throws a quick look                   at Fran)            Just a minute.                   (covers mouthpiece;                   to Fran)            If you don't mind -- this is sort            of personal                         FRAN            All right. Have a nice Christmas.She exits, closing the door. Bud takes his hand off themouthpiece.                         BUD                   (every word hurts)            Yes, Mr. Sheldrake -- no, I didn't            forget -- the tree is up and the            Tom and Jerry mix is in the            refrigerator -- yes, sir -- same to            you.He hangs up, stands there for a moment, the bowler still onhis head, the noise from the party washing over him. Heslowly crosses to the clothes-tree. picks up his coat -- anew, black chesterfield. With the coat over his arm, hestarts out of the office.INT. NINETEENTH FLOOR - DAYThe party has picked up tempo. On top of the desks, Sylviais doing a mock strip tease -- without taking any clothesoff. There is hollering, drinking and clapping all around her.Bud moves past the floor show, paying no attention. Kirkebyspots him, detaches himself from the cheering section aroundSylvia.                         KIRKEBY            Where you going, Buddy-boy? The            party's just starting.                   (catching up with him)            Listen, kid -- give me a break,            will you -- how about tomorrow            afternoon? I can't take her to that            drive-in again -- the car doesn't            even have a heater four o'clock --            okay?Bud ignores him, continues walking through the ranks ofempty desks.                                            DISSOLVE TO:INT. CHEAP BAR - COLUMBUS AVENUE IN THE SIXTIES - EVENINGIt is six o'clock, and the joint is crowded with customershaving one for the road before joining their families forChristmas Eve. There are men with gaily wrapped packages,small trussed-up Christmas trees, a plucked turkey in aplastic bag. Written across the mirror behind the bar, inglittering white letters, is HAPPY HOLIDAYS. Everybody is inhigh spirits, laughing it up and toasting each other.Everybody except Bud Baxter. He is standing at the bar inhis chesterfield and bowler, slightly isolated, broodingover an almost empty martini glass. The bartender comes up,sets down a fresh martini with an olive on a toothpick,takes his payment from a pile of bills and coins lying infront of Bud. Bud fishes out the olive, adds it to half adozen other impaled olives neatly arranged in fan shape onthe counter. He is obviously trying to complete the circle.A short, rotund man dressed as Santa Claus hurries in fromthe street, and comes up to the bar beside Bud.                         SANTA CLAUS                   (to bartender)            Hey, Charlie -- give me a shot of            bourbon -- and step on it -- my            sleigh is double parked.He laughs uproariously at his own joke, nudges Bud with hiselbow. Bud stares at him coldly, turns back to his martini.The laughter dies in Santa Claus' throat. He gets his shortof bourbon, moves down the bar to find more convivial company.Standing near the end of the curved bar is a girl in hermiddle twenties wearing a ratty fur coat. Her name is MARGIEMacDOUGALL, she is drinking a Rum Collins through a straw,and she too is alone. From a distance, she is studying Budwith interest. On the bar in front of her is a container ofstraws in paper wrappers. She takes one of them out, tearsoff the end of the paper, blows through the straw -- sendingthe wrapper floating toward Bud. The paper wrapper passesright in front of Bud's nose. He doesn't notice it.Margie, undaunted, lets go with another missile.This time the wrapper lands on the brim of Bud's bowler. Noreaction. Another wrapper comes floating in, hits Bud'scheek. He never takes his eye off his martini.Margie leaves her place, and carrying her handbag and herempty glass, comes up alongside Bud. Without a word, shereaches up and removes the wrapper from Bud's bowler.                         MARGIE            You buy me a drink, I'll buy you            some music.                   (sets the glass down)            Rum Collins.Not waiting for an answer, she heads for the juke box. Budlooks after her noncommittally, then turns to the bartender.                         BUD            Rum Collins.                   (indicating martini glass)            And another one of these little            mothers.At the juke box, Margie has dropped a coin in and made herselection. The music starts -- ADESTE FIDELIS. She rejoinsBud at the bar just as the bartender is putting down theirdrinks in front of them. Bud removes the new olive, adds itto the pattern on the counter in front of him. They bothdrink, staring straight ahead. For quite a while, there iscomplete silence between them.                         MARGIE                   (out of nowhere)            You like Castro?                   (a blank look from Bud)            I mean -- how do you feel about            Castro?                         BUD            What is Castro?                         MARGIE            You know, that big-shot down in            Cuba with the crazy beard.                         BUD            What about him?                         MARGIE            Because as far as I'm concerned,            he's a no good fink. Two weeks ago            I wrote him a letter -- never even            answered me.                         BUD            That so.                         MARGIE            All I wanted him to do was let            Mickey out for Christmas.                         BUD            Who is Mickey?                         MARGIE            My husband. He's in Havana -- in            jail.                         BUD            Oh. Mixed up in that revolution?                         MARGIE            Mickey? He wouldn't do nothing like            that. He's a jockey. They caught            him doping a horse.                         BUD            Well, you can't win 'em all.They sit there silently for a moment, contemplating theinjustices of the world.                         MARGIE                   (to herself)            'Twas the night before Christmas            And all through the house            Not a creature was stirring --            Nothing --            No action --            Dullsville!                   (drinks; to Bud)            You married?                         BUD            No.                         MARGIE            Family?                         BUD            No.                         MARGIE            A night like this, it sort of            spooks you to walk into an empty            apartment.                         BUD            I said I had no family -- I didn't            say I had an empty apartment.They both drink.                                            CUT TO:INT. BUD'S APARTMENT - EVENINGThe living room is dark, except for a shaft of light fromthe kitchen, and the glow of the colored bulbs on a smallChristmas tree in front of the phony fireplace.Hunched up in one corner of the couch is Fran, still in hercoat and gloves, crying softly. Pacing up and down isSheldrake. His coat and hat are on a chair, as are severalChristmas packages. On the coffee table are an unopenedbottle of Scotch, a couple of untouched glasses, and a bowlof melting ice.                         SHELDRAKE                   (stops and faces Fran)            Come on, Fran -- don't be like that.            You just going to sit there and            keep bawling?                   (no answer)            You won't talk to me, you won't            tell me what's wrong --                   (a new approach)            Look, I know you think I'm stalling            you. But when you've been married            to a woman for twelve years, you            don't just sit down at the breakfast            table and say "Pass the sugar --            and I want a divorce." It's not            that easy.                   (he resumes pacing;                   Fran continues crying)            Anyway, this is the wrong time. The            kids are home from school -- my in-            laws are visiting for the            holidays -- I can't bring it up now.                   (stops in front of her)            This isn't like you, Fran -- you            were always such a good sport --            such fun to be with --                         FRAN                   (through tears)            Yeah -- that's me. The Happy            Idiot -- a million laughs.                         SHELDRAKE            Well, that's more like it. At least            you're speaking to me.                         FRAN            Funny thing happened to me at the            office party today -- I ran into            your secretary -- Miss Olsen. You            know -- ring-a-ding-ding? I laughed            so much I like to died.                         SHELDRAKE            Is that what's been bothering            you -- Miss Olsen? That's ancient            history.                         FRAN            I was never very good at history.            Let me see -- there was Miss Olsen,            and then there was Miss Rossi --            no, she came before -- it was Miss            Koch who came after Miss Olsen --                         SHELDRAKE            Now, Fran --                         FRAN            And just think -- right now there's            some lucky girl in the building            who's going to come after me --                         SHELDRAKE            Okay, okay, Fran. I deserve that.            But just ask yourself -- why does a            man run around with a lot of girls?            Because he's unhappy at home --            because he's lonely, that's why --            all that was before you, Fran --            I've stopped running.Fran has taken a handkerchief out of her bag and is dabbingher eyes.                         FRAN            How could I be so stupid? You'd            think I would have learned by            now -- when you're in love with a            married man, you shouldn't wear            mascara.                         SHELDRAKE            It's Christmas Eve, Fran -- let's            not fight.                         FRAN            Merry Christmas.She hands him a flat, wrapped package.                         SHELDRAKE            What is it?He strips away the wrapping to reveal a long-playing record.The cover reads: RICKSHAW BOY - Jimmy Lee Kiang withOrchestra.                         SHELDRAKE            Oh. Our friend from the Chinese            restaurant. Thanks, Fran. We better            keep it here.                         FRAN            Yeah, we better.                         SHELDRAKE            I have a present for you. I didn't            quite know what to get you --            anyway it's a little awkward for            me, shopping --                   (he has taken out a                   money clip, detaches                   a bill)            -- so here's a hundred dollars --            go out and buy yourself something.He holds the money out, but she doesn't move. Sheldrakeslips the bill into her open bag.                         SHELDRAKE            They have some nice alligator bags            at Bergdorf's --Fran gets up slowly and starts peeling off her gloves.Sheldrake looks at her, then glances nervously at his wristwatch.                         SHELDRAKE            Fran, it's a quarter to seven --            and I mustn't miss the train -- if            we hadn't wasted all that time -- I            have to get home and trim the            tree --Fran has started to remove her coat.                         FRAN            Okay.                   (shrugs the coat back on)            I just thought as long as it was            paid for --                         SHELDRAKE                   (an angry step toward her)            Don't ever talk like that, Fran!            Don't make yourself out to be cheap.                         FRAN            A hundred dollars? I wouldn't call            that cheap. And you must be paying            somebody something for the use of            the apartment --                         SHELDRAKE                   (grabbing her arms)            Stop that, Fran.                         FRAN                   (quietly)            You'll miss your train, Jeff.Sheldrake hurriedly puts on his hat and coat, gathers up hispackages.                         SHELDRAKE            Coming?                         FRAN            You run along -- I want to fix my            face.                         SHELDRAKE                   (heading for the door)            Don't forget to kill the lights.            See you Monday.                         FRAN            Sure. Monday and Thursday -- and            Monday again -- and Thursday            again --                         SHELDRAKE                   (that stops him in                   the half-open door)            It won't always be like this.                   (coming back)            I love you, Fran.Holding the packages to one side, he tries to kiss her onthe mouth.                         FRAN                   (turning her head)            Careful -- lipstick.He kisses her on the cheek, hurries out of the apartment,closing the door. Fran stands there for a while, blinkingback tears, then takes the long-playing record out of itsenvelope, crosses to the phonograph. She puts the record on,starts the machine -- the music is JEALOUS LOVER. As itplays, Fran wanders aimlessly around the darkened room, herbody wracked by sobs. Finally she regains control of herself,and picking up her handbag, starts through the bedroomtoward the bathroom.In the bathroom, Fran switches on the light, puts her bag onthe sink, turns on the faucet. Scooping up some water, shewashes the smeared mascara away, then turns the faucet off,picks up a towel As she is drying her face, she notices inthe pull-away shaving mirror the magnified reflection of avial of pills on the medicine shelf. Fran reaches out forthe vial, turns it slowly around in her hand. The labelreads: SECONAL - ONE AT BEDTIME AS NEEDED FOR SLEEP.Fran studies the label for a second, then returns the vialto the shelf. She opens her handbag, takes out a lipstick.As she does so, she sees the hundred dollar bill Sheldrakeleft in the bag. Her eyes wander back to the vial on themedicine shelf. Then very deliberately she picks up Bud'smouthwash glass, removes the two toothbrushes from it, turnson the faucet, starts filling the glass with water.

CHEAP BAR - COLUMBUS AVENUE - NIGHTThe joint is deserted now except for the Santa Claus, who isleaning against the bar, quite loaded, and Bud and MargieMacDougall, who are dancing to a slow blues coming from thejuke box.

Go home.Bud and Margie ignore him, continue dancing -- or ratherswaying limply cheek-to-cheek. The bartender crosses to thejuke box, pulls the plug out. The music stops, but not Budand Margie -- they continue dancing.                         BARTENDER            O-U-T -- out!He goes to the front of the bar, starts to extinguish thelights. Margie picks up her handbag from the bar, and Buddowns the remains of his drink.                         MARGIE            Where do we go -- my place or yours?

MARGIE                   (looking around)            Say, this is Snugsville.                         BUD                   (helping her out of                   her coat)            Mrs. MacDougall, I think it is only            fair to warn you that you are now            alone with a notorious sexpot.                         MARGIE                   (a gleam)            No kidding.                         BUD            Ask anybody around here. As a            matter of fact, when it's time for            me to go -- and I may go just like            that --                   (snaps his fingers)            -- I have promised my body to the            Columbia Medical Center.                         MARGIE                   (shuddering deliciously)            Gee. Sort of gives you goose-bumps            just to think about it.                         BUD            Well, they haven't got me yet, baby.            Dig up some ice from the kitchen            and let's not waste any time --            preliminary-wise.                         MARGIE            I'm with you, lover.She takes the bowl of melted ice Bud has handed her,disappears into the kitchen. As Bud starts to remove hiscoat, he becomes aware of a scratching noise from thephonograph. He crosses to it, sees that the needle is stuckin the last groove of a long-playing record.Bud lifts the record off, examines it curiously, then putsit aside and substitutes the cha cha record. As the musicstarts, he dances over to the coat-rack beside the door,hangs up his chesterfield and bowler. He turns back into theroom, still dancing, suddenly spots Fran's gloves on thecoffee table. He picks up the gloves, looks around for someconvenient place to get rid of them. Moving over to thebedroom door, he opens it, tosses the gloves toward the bedinside. He shuts the door, starts to turn away, freezes in adelayed reaction to something he saw inside. He quicklyopens the door again, looks.Sprawled across the bed, on top of the bedspread, is Fran.The light from the bathroom falls across her. She is fullydressed, still in her coat, and apparently asleep.Bud steps into the bedroom, closing the door behind him,walks over to Fran.                         BUD            All right, Miss Kubelik -- get up.            It's past checking-out time, and            the hotel management would            appreciate it if you would get the            hell out of here.                   (Fran doesn't stir)            Look, Miss Kubelik, I used to like            you -- I used to like you a lot --            but it's all over between us -- so            beat it -- O-U-T -- out!                   (no reaction; he puts                   a hand on her                   shoulder, shakes her)            Come on -- wake up!She doesn't respond. But something falls out of her hand,rolls across the bed. Bud picks it up, looks at it -- it ishis sleeping-pill vial, now uncapped and empty.                         BUD                   (a hoarse whisper)            Oh, my God.For a second he is paralyzed. Then he drops the vial, grabsFran, lifts her into a sitting position on the bed, shakesher violently.                         BUD            Miss Kubelik! Miss Kubelik!Fran's head droops to one side, like a rag doll's. Bud letsgo of her, rushes out.In the living room, the phonograph is still cha cha-ing away.Bud dashes to the phone, picks it up. Then it occurs to himthat he doesn't know whom to call and he hangs up. Out ofthe kitchen comes Margie, with a bowlful of ice cubes.                         MARGIE            I broke a nail trying to get the            ice-tray out. You ought to buy            yourself a new refrigerator.Bud, not listening, runs past her to the hall door and out.                         MARGIE                   (calling after him)            I didn't mean right now.INT. SECOND FLOOR LANDING - NIGHTBud arrives at the door of the Dreyfuss apartment, startsringing the doorbell and pounding with his fist.                         BUD            Dr. Dreyfuss! Hey, Doc!The door opens, and Dr. Dreyfuss stands there sleepily,pulling on his beaten bathrobe.                         BUD                   (words tumbling over                   each other)            There's a girl in my place -- she            took some sleeping pills -- you            better come quick -- I can't wake            her up.                         DR. DREYFUSS            Let me get my bag.He disappears from the doorway.                         BUD            Hurry up, Doc.Bud turns and runs back into his apartment.INT.

MARGIE            Hey -- over here, lover.Bud stops in his tracks, suddenly aware of her.                         MARGIE            What's all this running around?            You're going to wear yourself out.Bud strides over to her purposefully, yanks her up to herfeet.                         MARGIE            Not so rough, honey.                         BUD                   (taking the glass out                   of her hand)            Good night.                         MARGIE            Good night?                         BUD                   (thrusting the fur                   coat at her)            The party's over.                         MARGIE            What's the matter? Did I do            something wrong?                         BUD                   (easing her toward door)            It's an emergency -- see you some            other time.Dr. Dreyfuss comes hurrying in, carrying his medical bag. Hestops, bewildered by the sound of music and the sight of awide-awake girl in the apartment.                         BUD            Not this one --                   (pointing to the bedroom)            -- in there, Doc.Dr. Dreyfuss proceeds into the bedroom.                         MARGIE            Say, what's going on here, anyway?                         BUD            Nothing.

MARGIE                   (pointing back)            My shoes.Bud reaches under the coffee table, where she left hershoes, retrieves them.                         MARGIE                   (bitterly)            Some lover you are. Some sexpot!Bud shoves the shoes at her, takes a bill out of his wallet,hands it to her.                         BUD            Here -- find yourself a phone booth            and call your husband in Havana.                         MARGIE            You bet I will. And when I tell him            how you treated me, he'll push your            face in.                   (he shoves her                   through the open door)            You fink!Bud slams the door shut, starts toward the bedroom. Halfwaythere, he becomes aware that the cha cha record is still on.He detours to the phonograph, switches it off, continuesinto the bedroom.In the bedroom, the overhead light is on, and Dr. Dreyfussis working on the unconscious Fran. He has removed her coat,and is shining a flashlight into her eyes, examining herpupils. Bud approaches the bed worriedly.                         BUD            She going to be all right, Doc?                         DR. DREYFUSS            How many pills were in that bottle?                         BUD            It was half-full -- about a dozen            or so. You going to have to take            her to the hospital?Dr. Dreyfuss ignores him. Out of his medical bag, he takes astomach tube with a rubber funnel at the end. Then he startsto lift Fran off the bed.                         DR. DREYFUSS            Help me, will you?Between them, they get Fran into an upright position.                         DR. DREYFUSS            Into the bathroom.They half-carry, half-drag Fran's limp form toward thebathroom.                         BUD            What are you going to do, Doc?                         DR. DREYFUSS            Get that stuff out of her stomach --            if it isn't too late. You better            put some coffee on -- and pray.Bud starts away as Dr. Dreyfuss takes Fran into the bathroom.Bud loses no time getting into the kitchen. He fills analuminum kettle with water, strikes a match, lights the gasburner, puts the kettle on. Then he takes a jar of instantcoffee and a chipped coffee mug out of the cupboard, shakesan excessive portion of coffee into the mug, sticks a spoonin it. He watches the kettle for a moment, mops his browwith a handkerchief, then starts back toward the bedroom.Bud crosses the bedroom to the half-open door of thebathroom, looks in anxiously. From inside come the sounds ofa coughing spasm and running water. Bud turns away, undoeshis tie and collar, paces the bedroom floor. Something onthe night table attracts his attention -- resting againstthe base of the lamp is a sealed envelope. Bud picks itup -- on it, in Fran's handwriting, is one word, JEFF. Heturns the letter over in his hand, trying to decide what todo with it.Dr. Dreyfuss emerges from the bathroom, carrying a pale,still unconscious Fran. Bud quickly conceals the suicidenote behind his back.                         DR. DREYFUSS            Bring my bag.He lugs Fran into the living room. Bud stashes the letter inhis back pocket, picks up the medical bag, follows them.In the living room, Dr. Dreyfuss lowers Fran into a chair.Her chin falls to her chest. Dreyfuss takes the bag fromBud, fishes out a hypodermic syringe, draws 2 c.c.'s from abottle of picrotoxin.                         DR. DREYFUSS            Roll up her right sleeve.Bud does so. Dr. Dreyfuss hands the hypodermic to Bud,searches for a spot for the injection.                         DR. DREYFUSS            Nice veins.He swabs the spot with alcohol, takes the hypodermic backfrom Bud.                         DR. DREYFUSS            Want to tell me what happened?                         BUD            I don't know -- I mean -- I wasn't            here -- you see -- we had some            words earlier -- nothing serious,            really -- what you might call a            lovers' quarrel --                         DR. DREYFUSS                   (making off-scene injection)            So you went right out and picked            yourself up another dame.                         BUD            Something like that.                         DR. DREYFUSS            You know, Baxter, you're a real            cutie-pie -- yes, you are.Bud just stands there, taking it. Fran stirs slightly, andfrom her parched lips comes a low moan. Dr. Dreyfuss grabsher by the hair, lifts her head up.                         DR. DREYFUSS            If you'd come home half an hour            later, you would have had quite a            Christmas present.With his free hand, Dr. Dreyfuss slaps Fran viciously acrossthe face. Bud winces. Dreyfuss, still holding Fran by thehair, takes a box of ammonia ampules out of his bag. Hecrushes one of the ampules in his hand, passes it under hernose. Fran tries to turn her head away. Dreyfuss slaps heragain, hard, crushes another ampule, repeats the process.Bud is watching tensely. From the kitchen comes the whistleof the boiling kettle, but Bud pays no attention.                         DR. DREYFUSS            Get the coffee.Bud hurries into the kitchen. He turns off the gas, poursthe boiling water into the mug with the instant coffee,stirs it. From off, come the sounds of more slapping andsome moaning. Bud carries the coffee out.In the living room, Dr. Dreyfuss is working another ammoniaampule under Fran's nose. Her eyes start fluttering. Dreyfusstakes the coffee mug from Bud, forces it between Fran'slips, pours coffee into her mouth. Fran resistsinstinctively, half the coffee dribbling over her chin anddress, but Dr. Dreyfuss keeps at it.                         DR. DREYFUSS            Let's get some air in here.

THE APARTMENT - DAWNThrough the bedroom window comes the first faint light ofdawn. Fran has been put to bed by an exhausted Dr. Dreyfuss.She is in her slip, and Dreyfuss is just drawing the blanketover her. Her eyes are closed, and she is moaning fitfully.Watching from the doorway is Bud, in shirtsleeves now, wearyand disheveled.                         DR. DREYFUSS            She'll sleep on and off for the            next twenty-four hours.

I ought            to charge you by the mile.They have now moved out into the living room, where theoverhead light and the Christmas tree bulbs are still on.                         DR. DREYFUSS            Any of that coffee left?                         BUD            Sure.He goes into the kitchen. Dr. Dreyfuss takes a small notebookwith a fountain pen clipped to it out of his bag, sinks downon the couch.                         DR.

(no answer from Bud)            Where does she live?Bud appears from the kitchen, stirring the coffee powder ina cup of hot water.                         BUD                   (apprehensive)            Why do you want to know, Doc? You            don't have to report this, do you?                         DR.

BUD            It's just that she's got a family --            and there's the people in the            office -- look, Doc, can't you            forget you're a doctor -- let's            just say you're here as a neighbor --                         DR. DREYFUSS                   (a long look at Bud)            Well, as a doctor, I guess I can't            prove it wasn't an accident.

DR. DREYFUSS                   (taking a big gulp of                   the spiked coffee)            I don't know what you did to that            girl in there -- and don't tell            me -- but it was bound to happen,            the way you carry on. Live now, pay            later. Diner's Club!                   (another swig)            Why don't you grow up, Baxter? Be a            mensch! You know what that means?

DREYFUSS                   (finishing coffee)            But you're not out of the woods            yet, Baxter -- because most of them            try it again!                   (picks up bag, starts                   toward door)            You know where I am if you need me.He walks out, closing the door after him. Bud dejectedlyturns off the overhead light, kicks out the plug of theChristmas tree lights, trudges into the bedroom.Fran is fast asleep. Bud picks up her dress, gets a hanger,drapes the dress over it, hangs it from the door. An earlymorning chill has invaded the room, and Bud switches an theelectric blanket to keep Fran warm. Then he slumps into achair beside the bed, looks at Fran compassionately. Thelight on the dial of the electric blanket glows in thegrayish room. Bud just sits there, watching Fran.                                            FADE OUT:FADE IN:INT.

Open up already!Finally the door opens a crack, and Bud peers out. He lookslike a man who has slept in his clothes -- rumpled, bleary-eyed, unshaven.

All night I didn't sleep            ten minutes -- and I'm sure you            woke up Dr. Dreyfuss.

THE APARTMENT - DAYBud closes the door, crosses toward the bedroom, looksinside. Fran is asleep under the electric blanket, breathingevenly. He tries to shut the bedroom door, but it won'tclose completely because Fran's dress, on a hanger. ishooked over the top. He goes to the phone, picks it up,dials the operator.

There is a hugeChristmas tree and a jumble of presents, open gift boxes,and discarded wrappings.Sheldrake and his two sons, TOMMY and JEFF JR., are squattingon the floor, testing a Cape Canaveral set the kids got forChristmas. Sheldrake is in a brand new dressing gown, with amanufacturer's tag still dangling from it, and the boys arein pajamas and astronaut's helmets. As for the Cape Canaveralset, it is a miniature layout of block-houses, launchingpads, and assorted space-missiles. Tommy has his finger onthe button controlling one of the rockets.                         SHELDRAKE                   (counting down)            7-6-5-4-3-2-1 -- let her rip!Tommy presses the button, and a spring sends the rockettoward the ceiling. Just then, the phone in the entrancehall starts ringing.                         JEFF JR.            I'll get it.He hurries to the phone.                         TOMMY            Hey, Dad -- why don't we put a fly            in the nose cone and see if we can            bring it back alive?                         SHELDRAKE            It's a thought.                         TOMMY            Maybe we should send up two flies --            and see if they'll propagate in            orbit.

KIRKEBY            -- so yesterday afternoon I take            Sylvia up to the apartment, and            guess who he's got stashed away in            the bedroom?                         DOBISCH            Who?                         KIRKEBY            Kubelik.                         DOBISCH            No kidding.

MATUSCHKA            Mr. Dobisch?                         DOBISCH            Yeah.                         MATUSCHKA            My name is Karl Matuschka -- my            sister-in-law, she runs one of the            elevators here -- Fran Kubelik.                         KIRKEBY                   (exchanging a glance                   with Dobisch)            Miss Kubelik?                         MATUSCHKA            You know her?                         DOBISCH            Of course. There may be a lot of            employees here -- but we're one big            happy family.                         MATUSCHKA            Well, she lives with us -- and my            wife, she's getting a little            nervous -- on account of Fran            hasn't been home for two days.                         KIRKEBY                   (another look at Dobisch)            That so.                         MATUSCHKA            Anyway, we was wondering if somebody            in the office would know what            happened to her.                         DOBISCH            I see.                   (to Kirkeby)            What do you think, Al? Can we help            the man?                         KIRKEBY                   (after a pregnant pause)            Why not? We don't owe Buddy-boy            anything.                         DOBISCH            Yeah. What's Buddy-boy done for us            lately?

THE APARTMENT - EVENINGBuddy-boy is bending over a hot stove, preparing an Italiandinner. He takes a saucepan of spaghetti off the fire, andpicking up the tennis racquet with the other hand, pours thespaghetti on top of the racquet strings. Then he turns onthe faucet, runs water over the spaghetti. With the combinedtechnique of Brillat-Savarin and Pancho Gonzales, he gentlyagitates the racquet, letting the water drain off thespaghetti. As he works, he hums a theme from Tschaikowsky'sCapriccio Italien.Fran walks in, still in her robe.                         FRAN            Are we dressing for dinner?                         BUD            No -- just come as you are.                         FRAN                   (watching him)            Say, you're pretty good with that            racquet.                         BUD            You ought to see my backhand.                   (dumping spaghetti                   into platter)            And wait till I serve the meatballs.                   (demonstrates)                         FRAN            Shall I light the candles?                         BUD            It's a must -- gracious-living-wise.As Fran starts into the living room, Bud begins to ladlemeat sauce onto the spaghetti, humming operatically.In the living room, the small table has been set for two,and prominent on it is the champagne bottle that Mr. Kirkebyleft behind, still in its cardboard bucket, but freshly iced.As Fran lights the candles, she notices the napkins on thetable, peels a price-tag off the corner of one of them.                         FRAN            I see you bought some napkins.                         BUD            Might as well go all the way.He carries the platter of spaghetti and meat sauce in fromthe kitchen, sets it on the table, sprinkles some cheese onit. Then he crosses to the coffee table, where a fullmartini pitcher stands in readiness, fills a couple ofglasses. Fran seats herself at the table.                         BUD            You know, I used to live like            Robinson Crusoe -- shipwrecked            among eight million people. Then            one day I saw a footprint in the            sand -- and there you were --                   (hands her martini)            It's a wonderful thing -- dinner            for two.                         FRAN            You usually eat alone?                         BUD            Oh, no. Sometimes I have dinner            with Ed Sullivan, sometimes with            Dinah Shore or Perry Como -- the            other night I had dinner with Mae            West -- of course, she was much            younger then.                   (toasting)            Cheers.                         FRAN            Cheers.They drink.                         BUD            You know what we're going to do            after dinner?                         FRAN            The dishes?                         BUD            I mean, after that?                         FRAN            What?                         BUD            You don't have to if you don't want            to --                         FRAN            I don't?                         BUD            We're going to finish that gin game.                         FRAN            Oh.                         BUD            So I want you to keep a clear head.The door bell rings. Carrying his martini glass, Bud crossesto the door, starts to open it.                         BUD            Because I don't want to take            advantage of you -- the way I did            yesterday in bed.By now the door is open, and Bud is speaking to Fran overhis shoulder. He turns, finds himself face to face with KarlMatuschka, who is standing grimly in the doorway.                         MATUSCHKA            Baxter?                         BUD            Yes?Matuschka shoves him roughly aside, strides past him towardFran, who has risen to her feet.                         MATUSCHKA            What's with you, Fran -- did you            forget where you live?                         FRAN                   (to Bud)            This is my brother-in-law, Karl            Matuschka.                         BUD                   (friendly)            How do you do, Mr. Matuschka?                         MATUSCHKA                   (pushing Bud away; to Fran)            Okay, get your clothes on. I got            the cab downstairs.                         BUD            Now, wait a minute. I know what            you're thinking -- but it's not as            bad as it looks --                         MATUSCHKA                   (shoving him away)            It's none of my business what you            do, Fran -- you're over twenty-            one -- but your sister happens to            think you're a lady.                         BUD            All we were going to do is eat and            wash the dishes --                         MATUSCHKA                   (grabbing him)            Look, Buddy-boy -- if there wasn't            a lady present, I'd clobber you.                         FRAN                   (separating them)            All right, Karl -- I'll get dressed.She exits into the bedroom, removing her dress from thedoor, and closing it. Matuschka leans against the wallbeside the hall door, eyeing Bud truculently. Bud raises afinger to remonstrate with him -- then breaks into a nervous,ingratiating smile.                         BUD            Care for a martini? Champagne?                   (Matuschka continues                   glaring at him)            How about a little spaghetti with            meat sauce? Made it myself.                   (Matuschka just scowls)            Your sister-in-law sure is            terrific --                   (realizes his mistake;                   switching abruptly)            Must be murder driving a cab in New            York -- I mean, with all that            cross-town traffic --He gestures with the martini glass, spilling the contentsover his shirtfront. Through the partly open hall door, Dr.Dreyfuss sticks his head in.                         DR. DREYFUSS            Hi, Baxter.He steps into the apartment, passing Matuschka withoutseeing him.                         DR. DREYFUSS            How's the patient?

BUD            Oh, this is Mr. Matuschka -- he's            Miss Kubelik's -- he's got a cab            downstairs --                         MATUSCHKA                   (to Dreyfuss)            Fran been sick or something?Dr. Dreyfuss looks at Bud.

BUD            Who else?Matuschka lashes out with a left to Bud's jaw, and while heis off balance, catches him with a right to the eye.

BUD            Well, it's just that so many things            have been happening so fast -- I'm            very pleased -- especially for Miss            Kubelik. Now that I've gotten to            know her better, I think she's the            kind of girl that definitely ought            to be married to somebody --                         SHELDRAKE            Oh, sure, sure. But first the            property settlement has to be            worked out -- then it takes six            weeks in Reno -- meanwhile, I'm            going to enjoy being a bachelor for            a while.

SHELDRAKE            That's just one of the privileges            that goes with this job. You also            get a nice little expense account,            the use of the executive washroom --                   (breaks off, peers at                   Bud's face)            Say, what happened to you, Baxter?                         BUD            I got kicked in the head, too.                         SHELDRAKE            Oh?With a shrug, he exits into his own office, closing the doorbehind him.

We got two brain            surgeons, an ear, nose and throat            specialist, a proctologist, and            three nurses from Bellevue.                         BUD            No, thanks -- I don't feel like it.            Look, Doc -- in case I don't see            you again -- how much do I owe you            for taking care of that girl?                         DR. DREYFUSS            Forget it -- I didn't do it as a            doctor -- I did it as a neighbor.                   (stopping in doorway)            By the way, whatever happened to her?                         BUD                   (airily)            You know me with girls. Easy come,            easy go. Goodbye, Doc.                         DR. DREYFUSS            Happy New Year.Bud closes the door, returns to the kitchen, brings out abox of glassware and the tennis racquet. As he starts todeposit the racquet in a carton, he notices a strand ofspaghetti clinging to the strings. He removes it gently,stands there twirling the limp spaghetti absently around hisfinger.                                            CUT TO:INT. CHINESE RESTAURANT - NIGHTIt is five minutes before midnight, New Year's Eve. Sittingalone in the last booth is Fran, a paper hat on her head, apensive look on her face. There are two champagne glasses onthe table, and the usual noisemakers, but the chair oppositeher is empty. Above the general hubbub, the Chinese pianistcan be heard playing. After a moment, Fran glances off.Threading his way through the merrymakers crowding the barand overflowing from the booths is Sheldrake. He is indinner clothes, topped by a paper hat. Reaching the lastbooth, he drops into the chair facing Fran.                         SHELDRAKE            Sorry it took me so long on the            phone. But we're all set.                         FRAN            All set for what?                         SHELDRAKE            I rented a car -- it's going to be            here at one o'clock -- we're            driving to Atlantic City.                         FRAN            Atlantic City?                         SHELDRAKE            I know it's a drag -- but you can't            find a hotel room in town -- not on            New Year's Eve.                         FRAN                   (a long look at Sheldrake)            Ring out the old year, ring in the            new. Ring-a-ding-ding.                         SHELDRAKE            I didn't plan it this way, Fran --            actually, it's all Baxter's fault.                         FRAN            Baxter?                         SHELDRAKE            He wouldn't give me the key to the            apartment.                         FRAN            He wouldn't.                         SHELDRAKE            Just walked out on me -- quit --            threw that big fat job right in my            face.                         FRAN                   (a faint smile)            The nerve.                         SHELDRAKE            That little punk -- after all I did            for him! He said I couldn't bring            anybody to his apartment --            especially not Miss Kubelik. What's            he got against you, anyway?                         FRAN                   (a faraway look in                   her eye)            I don't know. I guess that's the            way it crumbles -- cookie-wise.                         SHELDRAKE            What are you talking about?                         FRAN            I'd spell it out for you -- only I            can't spell.The piano player is consulting the watch on his upraisedleft arm. He drops the arm in a signal, and the lights goout. At the same time, he strikes up AULD LANG SYNE.All over the dimly lit room, couples get to their feet,embracing and joining in the song.In the last booth, Sheldrake leans across the table, kissesFran.                         SHELDRAKE            Happy New Year, Fran.Fran's expression is preoccupied. Sheldrake faces in thedirection of the pianist, and holding his glass aloft, singsalong with the others.As AULD LANG SYNE comes to an end, the place explodesnoisily -- there is a din of horns, ratchets, and shoutedgreetings. The lights come up again.In the last booth, Sheldrake turns back toward Fran -- butshe is no longer there. Her paper hat lies abandoned on hervacated chair.                         SHELDRAKE            Fran --                   (looking around)            -- where are you, Fran?He rises, cranes his neck, trying to spot her in the crowd.                                            DISSOLVE TO:EXT. BROWNSTONE HOUSE - NIGHTFran, a coat thrown over the dress she was wearing at theRickshaw, comes down the street almost at a run. There is ahappy, expectant look on her face. She hurries up the stepsof the house and through the front door.INT. STAIRCASE AND SECOND FLOOR LANDING - NIGHTFran mounts the stairs eagerly. As she reaches the landingand heads for Bud's apartment, there is a loud, sharp reportfrom inside.Fran freezes momentarily, then rushes to the door.                         FRAN            Mr. Baxter!                   (pounding on door)            Mr. Baxter! Mr. Baxter!The door opens and there stands Bud, the bottle of champagnehe has just uncorked still foaming over in his hand. Hestares at Fran unbelievingly.                         FRAN                   (sagging with relief)            Are you all right?                         BUD            I'm fine.                         FRAN            Are you sure? How's your knee?                         BUD            I'm fine all over.                         FRAN            Mind if I come in?                         BUD                   (still stunned)            Of course not.INT. THE APARTMENT - NIGHTFran comes in and Bud shuts the door. The room is the sameas we left it, except for an empty champagne glass standingon the coffee table.                         BUD            Let me get another glass.He goes to one of the cartons, takes out a champagne glasswrapped in newspaper, starts to unwrap it.                         FRAN                   (looking around)            Where are you going?                         BUD            Who knows? Another neighborhood --            another town -- another job -- I'm            on my own.                         FRAN            That's funny -- so am I.                   (Bud, pouring                   champagne, looks up                   at her)            What did you do with the cards?                         BUD                   (indicating carton)            In there.Fran takes the deck of cards and the gin rummy score pad outof the carton, settles herself on the couch, starts toshuffle the cards expertly.                         BUD            What about Mr. Sheldrake?                         FRAN            I'm going to send him a fruit cake            every Christmas.Bud sinks down happily on the couch, and Fran holds out thedeck to him.                         FRAN            Cut.Bud cuts a card, but doesn't look at it.                         BUD            I love you, Miss Kubelik.                         FRAN                   (cutting a card)            Seven --                   (looking at Bud's card)            -- queen.She hands the deck to Bud.                         BUD            Did you hear what I said, Miss            Kubelik? I absolutely adore you.                         FRAN                   (smiling)            Shut up and deal!Bud begins to deal, never taking his eyes off her. Franremoves her coat, starts picking up her cards and arrangingthem. Bud, a look of pure joy on his face, deals -- anddeals -- and keeps dealing.And that's about it. Story-wise.                                            FADE OUT.                                                         THE END
