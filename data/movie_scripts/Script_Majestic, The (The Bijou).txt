THE BIJOU by Michael Sloane REVISED DRAFT October 14, 1997 "... the magic is all around you. All the time. Everywhere. In every thing. The trick... is to see it."IN BLACK...... the insistent, persistent, eight-to-the-bar beat ofBOOGIE-WOOGIE. Hot, exciting, pulsating rhythm, ramping up.THEN...... in the blackness, falling s-l-o-w-l-y, tumblingg-e-n-t-l-y, a picture-postcard: "GREETINGS FROM HOLLYWOOD!"Then another... and another, each one dropping through frame,a gentle rain.In these old postcards, Hollywood is a dream town where moviestars glide out of big cars to press their hands-and-footprints in the wet cement.Another postcard: "I'M MEETING THE STARS AT HOLLYWOOD & VINE!"In this postcard myth, you'd toddle down to Hollywood andVine, bump into Bogie and Bacall, and join them for dinner atthe Brown Derby. Or Ciro's. Or the Coconut Grove...More postcards. Pictures of movie theaters, but not the onesthat you and I know today. These are palaces. Temples. Grauman's Chinese and Egyptian. The Carthay Circle. TheParamount, the Million Dollar. From a time when moviegoingwas a complete experience, not a trip to the local mall. Theushers were friendly and helpful and wore gold brocadedjackets and guided you to your seat. The popcorn was hot andfresh and buttered with real butter, not 30-weight motor oil. CUT TO:THE PILE OF POSTCARDSa wild jumble. Then, one LAST POSTCARD drops lazily on topof the pile. It's a view of Hollywood at night, a carpet oflights under the yawning, protective smile of Mt. Lee's mostfamous resident, the fully-lit HOLLYWOOD SIGN. We PUSH INTOTHE PICTURE OF THE SIGN, DISSOLVING UNTIL WE'RE...... PUSHING INTO THE REAL HOLLYWOOD SIGN, closer and closer,until we fly right through it -- then crazily loop up andbehind it until we're looking down at...EXT. HOLLYWOOD (AERIAL VIEW) - NIGHTSUPER TITLE: 1951A gigantic aerial shot. Postwar autos fill the muggymidsummer evening air with the sounds of thousands of HONKINGHORNS, a mere precursor to the traffic yet to come. Darkenedoutlying neighborhoods are evidence of the postwar homeconstruction boom, as scores of stucco bungalows are beingbuilt in the areas surrounding the beating heart of the town,a swath of garishly bright concrete calledHOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD. PETE'S NARRATION (V.O.) Of course, it's not like the postcards say it is. This is what it's like. I'm Pete Appleton, and this is my town.Still in the same shot, we rocket down into the center of theintersection of Hollywood and Vine, then head west along theboulevard, skimming just above the traffic -- past Musso andFrank's Grill and the Hollywood Canteen, past the EgyptianTheater and a rumbling Pacific Electric Red Car, acrossHighland Avenue, past the Paramount Theater, and across thestreet toGRAUMAN'S CHINESE THEATER. PETE'S NARRATION (V.O.) Born and raised here, thank you very much. Sometimes, it seems like everyone here is from somewhere else. But everyone loves the movies, so Hollywood is everyone's town, and they come here by the busload. To them, Grauman's Chinese Theater is just about the most exciting place on the planet. To me, it's the theater that's playing "The African Queen."And like the man said, the film on the marquee is "THEAFRICAN QUEEN." Still the same shot, buses disgorgeTOURISTS, who move into the forecourt of the theater. TheMEN doff their hats and mop their brows. The WOMEN pulltheir blouses away from their chests, fanning themselves withmovie-star maps as they marvel at the signed cement blocks. We MOVE AMONG THEM, until we pick up A COUPLE, and we staybehind them as they work their way through the crowd, ontheir way toTHE THEATER ENTRANCE,where an ornately attired DOORMAN smiles and tears theirtickets. DOORMAN Newsreel's just starting, folks. PETE'S NARRATION (V.O.) That's me and my girlfriend. Her name is Sandra Sinclair, and this is her town, too -- she's from Cleveland. She came out here to be an actress, and that's just what she's doing. The first picture I ever wrote, a little potboiler called "Sand Pirates of the Sahara." Okay, it ain't "Citizen Kane," but you gotta start somewhere.MOVING INTO THE LOBBYan explosion of glitz mixed with Chinese myth and legend. Everywhere you look, it's red and orange and plush carpetingand golden light. We MOVE THROUGH the lobby, still in thesame shot, still tracking the couple, heading for theauditorium doors, which are swept open by two ramrod-erectUSHERS and we move intoTHE DARKENED THEATER.As the couple, Pete and Sandra, find seats, we HEAR thesoundtrack of the film before we see the screen, theunmistakable strains of a march, and then -- still in thesame shot -- we see the screen...A NEWSREEL.As the march SWELLS to a crescendo, we HEAR THE NEWSREELANNOUNCER'S SONOROUS VOICE: NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER Bringing the news of the world to you!Over a newsreel shot of a packed Congressional CommitteeHearing Room, a title blares "HOLLYWOOD REDS GO TO JAIL!" NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER Four years ago, in one of filmland's darkest hours, ten men, the so-called "Hollywood Ten," were called to testify before the House Committee of Un-American Activities, investigating the proliferation of the dreaded Red Menace in Hollywood.We see several shots of WITNESSES engaged in heated verbalbattles with congressmen, especially Committee Chairman T. JOHNSTON DOYLE and the Majority Counsel, ELVIN CLYDE. NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER Refusing to answer the lawmaker's questions, cowering behind the Fifth Amendment's protection against self-incrimination, the ten motion picture writers dared Congress to come after them. Well, come after them they did! And after years of court wrangling, it's now time to pay the piper!Over shots of several of the "Hollywood Ten" being led tojail in handcuffs, the newsreel narration continues. NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER And so, it's off to jail, the charge: Contempt of Congress! This should give you fellas something to write about now! A new round of investigations begins this fall, the mandate: Get the reds out of Hollywood!In the audience, one man YELLS "Lock up the commiebastards!," and a few others cheer and laugh. As thenewsreel moves on to a somewhat more innocuous subject, weWHEEL AROUND AND...ENDFRAME ON PETE APPLETON AND SANDRA SINCLAIR.Pete's a handsome fellow in his 30s, and Sandra's a starletpretty girl in her mid-20s. As she rummages in her purse,Pete watches the newsreel. SANDRA Pete, there's time before the picture starts, you want to get some popcorn? PETE You bet, honey.Pete kisses Sandra on the cheek, then stands and sprints upthe aisle to the concession stand, a big unworried grin onhis face. PETE'S NARRATION (V.O.) We were young, we were in love, and we were working in pictures. Life... was good. DISSOLVE TO:EXT. UNITED PICTURES STUDIOS - MAIN GATE - MORNINGPete pulls up to the guard kiosk in his spiffy yellowconvertible Plymouth. The Guard, RAY, steps out to meet him. Pete lights up a cigarette. We get a better sense of himnow. Though earnest, he's jocular, and a bit of a fasttalker. PETE (very chipper) Mornin', Ray. Whaddya know whaddya say? Me and Sandra caught "The African Queen" at the Chinese last night. Great picture, great picture.Ray is nonplussed. Tips his hat. Regards Pete suspiciously. RAY Mr. Appleton. PETE What's with this "Mr. Appleton" crap? Your boss hiding in there? RAY You're clear to go in. PETE What's that mean?Ray heads back to his kiosk, shaking his head. RAY Have a pleasant day.Pete, covering his worry well, drives onto the lot.EXT. UNITED PICTURES STUDIOS - WRITER'S BUILDING - MORNINGPete pulls up, hops out, grinds out his cigarette, looksaround and goes inside.INT. WRITER'S BUILDING HALLWAY - MORNINGPete comes down the hall a few steps, stops. Something'swrong. It's awfully quiet. He pokes his head into the doormarked "TYPING POOL."INT. TYPING POOL - MORNINGA sea of black Underwoods -- all silent. The lights in theroom are off, and hard shafts of morning sun stream inthrough the windows. One typists, LOUISE, is going frommachine to machine, pulling covers over them. PETE Louise... what gives?She looks up, startled. LOUISE Oh Pete... they, uh, they gave everybody the day off... while they sort things out. PETE Sort what out? Are my pages done? LOUISE They took 'em. PETE They took 'em? Who took 'em? Louise, what's going on... LOUISE Pete, I'm not even supposed to be talking to you...She rushes past him. Pete doesn't quite know what to think. MAN'S VOICE (O.S.) Good morning, Peter.Pete turns. The voice belongs to Pete's agent, LEO KUBELSKY,a rotund man in his fifties. He wears a perfectly tailoredsilk suit. PETE Leo... what's going on? CUT TO:EXT. STUDIO STREET - DAYFROM FAR AWAY, we watch as Leo and Pete come out of theWriter's Building and join a flood of DRESS EXTRAS, all doneup in Puritan pilgrim garb and heading for the commissary.As they move through the mob and emerge on the other side,it's clear that Pete is reeling from something he's just beentold.PETE AND LEO LEO Peter, their hands are tied. You see that, don't you? PETE I... I don't believe this. LEO Are you saying it's a mistake, that you didn't go to any meetings? They say you did. PETE Who the hell is this "they?" LEO Congress, the FBI, Red Channels, it don't matter who the hell "they" is. "They" know who "they" are, that's all that matters. (deliberately) Now, did you go to any meetings? PETE (on the spot) No. Yeah... I... I don't know. Maybe I did. Leo, this was before Pearl Harbor. I was in college. It was a bunch of kids, and I was just one of 'em. I didn't believe in what they were saying. Hell, I didn't even know what they were saying! LEO So, you're saying that it's true. You went to a meeting of a known communist organization. PETE Leo, I was trying to impress a skirt. You know me, I'm non- political. Republican, Democrat, Communist, there's not a dime's worth of difference between 'em anyway. LEO You should watch what you say. PETE I don't know who fingered me, but I'm not a communist! LEO Kid, that cuts no ice with them. PETE (frustrated) What? That I'm accused of being a communist when I don't happen to be one? LEO They know you were at that meeting, Peter. They've been told, and they know. PETE Leo, you're my agent. Tell "them" to take a flyin' piss. I didn't do anything wrong. I fought in the war, for crissakes! LEO Fought? Come on, Pete, you ran the PX at Fort Dix. PETE I was decorated. LEO I know. A Purple Heart. PETE Exactly. LEO You broke your arm. You were coming out of a bar. You were drunk. PETE At least I was on our side! Look, they want me to testify? I'll testify. I'll tell 'em anything they want to hear! Jesus, Leo, this is my career! LEO You can't testify. PETE Why not?Leo takes a gold cigarette care from his breast pocket,offers a cigarette to Pete and takes one for himself. LEO Don't take this personally, kid. If it were up to me, I'd have you testify wearing your uniform and your medal, wrapped in a flag with one hand on your heart and the other hand on a bible. What can I say? I like you.Leo lights Pete's cigarette and his own. Puts a fatherlyhand on his shoulder. LEO They don't want you to testify because you're not a big enough fish for them. They just don't want you writing pictures for now. That's all. PETE (under his breath) Yeah, well, that's enough. LEO Peter, I believe in you. More to the point, I read your new script... um... PETE "Ashes To Ashes?" LEO That's the one, "Ashes To Ashes." I think it's great. But it'll never get made with this communist business hanging over your head. You can't work until you're cleared -- and believe me, starting right now, I'm gonna do everything I can to make that happen. PETE So, it is a blacklist. LEO (defensive) Don't say that. There is no such thing as a blacklist. (calm) Now, are you gonna play ball? PETE (sullenly) Yes. (then, pissed) Leo, goddammit... this isn't fair!Leo blows out a thin stream of smoke. LEO (hand on Pete's shoulder) Kid, this is the United States Government we're talkin' about. Fair ain't the point. CUT TO:INT. WRITER'S BUILDING/PETE'S OFFICE - DAYProminent on the wall is a framed "SAND PIRATES OF THESAHARA" poster. Pete reaches up and takes it down. He leansit up against the desk, then sits heavily in the woodenswivel chair. He swivels around to seeA STUDIO SECURITY GUARDstanding by the door. He's watching Pete's every move.Two boxes sit on the desk, partially packed with Pete'sbelongings. Pete lights a cigarette and opens the lower deskdrawer. He pulls out a stack of scripts and sets them on thedesk. He looks at the cover of the first one: "SAND PIRATES OF THE SAHARA" By Peter Appleton A United Pictures Production February 19, 1951Pete shuffles the scripts and looks at the cover of thesecond one: "ASHES TO ASHES" By Peter AppletonHe jams the scripts into one box and turns to the other box,which contains somewhat more personal items. A ragged goldpillow with tassels. Legal pads of notes. An old tin-toyfire truck, its bright red paint chipped and worn. He turnsit around in his hands. PETE (musing) Huh. Red...Footsteps approach, and Pete swivels toward the door. SANDRA (O.S.) Pete? Pete...?Sandra appears in the doorway. She's in costume -- a LouisXIV courtier. She bustles past the Guard, rushes to Pete andembraces him. SANDRA Oh, Pete...They kiss. The Guard watches their every move. SANDRA What happened? PETE What exactly did you hear? SANDRA That you got let go. PETE I wasn't alone. Wasn't Frankie Ruskin directing the picture you're in? SANDRA He was, but he got sick. We got a new director today. Why? PETE Well, whatever Frankie's got, it's catching. SANDRA You mean, he was... let go, too? PETE (sotto, an appeal) They're saying I'm a communist, Sandy. But I'm not, you know that. I'm gonna fight 'em, and I'm gonna win, but I'll need your help.During this last, Sandra has been ever-so-slightly pullingaway from Pete. PETE A lot of good people are being accused of things they didn't do. Hell, even if I was a communist, this is America, goddammit, a person should be able to be whatever they want to be! Right?Sandra glances at the Guard, who is watching everything. SANDRA (nervously) Of course, but I... I don't know how I... how much help I can be to you. This is the sort of thing... someone saying you're a communist... it can ruin your career.Pete sees where this is going. She's edging toward the door. PETE Will you help me, Sandy? SANDRA I'll have to think about this. I have to get back... I should go...And she's out the door and gone in the blink of an eye. Petelooks at the Guard. PETE So nice to be a pariah.The Guard turns away. Pete moves back toward the boxes. Rummaging again, he comes up with a bottle of Jack Danielswith barely one swig left. He regards the bottle for amoment, looks to see if the Guard is watching (he isn't),pops the cork, puts it to his lips and drains it. He looksat it thoughtfully as we CUT TO:A HALF-FULL BOTTLE OF JACK DANIELS setting down on a bartop.WIDERINT. THE FROLIC ROOM - NIGHTThe bottle is in front of Pete, who sits at the bar, quietlygetting stewed. The Frolic Room is a classic Hollywood dive,dimly lit and full of character and characters. It's a quietnight and getting quieter, as several PATRONS are justleaving, waving goodbye to the bartender, JERRY, early 40s. Jerry turns to Pete, eyes him suspiciously from the end ofthe bar. Pete picks up the bottle and pours another shot. Good boy, he got most of it in the glass. JERRY Pete. You think maybe you've had enough? PETE Bought the bottle, didn't I? (raises the shot) To the United States of America. Long my she wave.He knocks it back and Jerry pours him another. PETE (trying to light a smoke) Thanks, Jerry. Tell me something. JERRY What. PETE You tight with J. Edgar Hoover? JERRY (helps Pete light his cigarette) The G-man? PETE (thickly) Zackly. JERRY Pete, if J. Edgar Hoover walked in here wearing a dress, I wouldn't know him. PETE Too bad. He says I'm a communist. JERRY (glancing around) You should watch what you say. You don't know who's listening. PETE You know I'm not a communist, don't you, Jer? JERRY Sure, I suppose. That why you're on a bender? PETE This is not a bender yet. This is the start of a bender. But I can see how you were confused, they look a lot alike.Pete drains his shotglass, puts it back on the bar. Hewatches Jerry, who is not about to refill it. Pete reachesfor the bottle, but Jerry is faster. JERRY Pete... go home. Come on, I'll call that girlfriend of yours, what's her name... Sandy? PETE (laughs) Sandra Sinclair. JERRY Gimmee her number, I'll have her pick you up. PETE Sandra Sinclair. Wanna know her real name? Bella Iskowitz. No one's who they really are, Jer. Everyone's someone else. Even you. Even me. Especially me. I'm Peter Appleton, the communist who's not really a communist. JERRY I wanna close up soon. C'mon, let's call her.Peter stands, stubs out his smoke, drops a few crumpled billson the bar and grabs his hat. PETE Nope. Can't. We're through. JERRY Then I'll call you a cab. PETE I'll save you the trouble. (beat) I'm a cab. There. Did it myself.Pete's preoccupied with putting on his hat and getting hiscar keys out of his coat pocket, a daunting task in hiscondition. PETE 'Sides, car's right outside. I'll be seein' ya, Jer. JERRY Pete...And he's out the door.EXT.

Too drunk to drive.He looks at his watch. PETE One-thirty. Huh! Early. Can't go home yet.He turns the key and hits the starter. The engine hums tolife. Pete sits up, opens his eyes wide, shakes off the hazeand puts the car in gear.The Plymouth lurches forward a few yards, screeches to a haltand stalls. PETE Oops.He re-starts the car, puts it in gear, and pulls away anddown the deserted boulevard. DISSOLVE TO:EXT. SANTA MONICA BEACH, AMUSEMENT PIER - NIGHTThe full moon is low over the ocean. Pete's car is parked atthe edge of the sand, the water fifty yards away. The ferriswheel and the roller coaster of the amusement pier are darkand eerie silhouettes, lit only by moonlight. Pete is asleepin the driver's seat, head tilted back, his hat covering hisface, snoring.The waves CRASH against the pilings and startle Pete awake. PETE Huh? Whatsa...Instantly, he grabs his head. PETE'S NARRATION (V.O.) I had no idea how I got to Santa Monica, but it certainly was a good idea. I don't think I could've faced the headache I had alone in my apartment. At least I had the ocean air.Pete takes a deep breath... and starts coughing. He gets outhis cigarettes and lights up. He takes a puff and glances athis watch. PETE'S NARRATION (V.O.) Three forty-five. I had only been there for a couple of hours at most. Truth be told, I was still fairly drunk.He starts the car and heads for the highway. PETE'S NARRATION (V.O.) I'd head north until the sun came up or I ran out of gas, whichever came first. DISSOLVE TO:EXT. PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY - NIGHTPete drives along the moonlit two-lane blacktop. Waves crashto the shore below the roadway.INT./ EXT. PETE'S CAR (DRIVING) - NIGHTPete is finally relaxed. He takes off his hat and jams itdown in the back seat.

PETE Shit. PETE'S NARRATION (V.O.) Guess which came first.He scans the road ahead -- nothing. Glances to his right.PETE'S POVThe lights of a small town can be seen off in the distance.Pete veers the car off the highway and makes the turn thatwill take him toward the lights. He passes a hand-paintedsign that gives him hope: "GAS - 1 MI." CUT TO:EXT. RORY'S GAS STATION - NIGHTPete's car rolls up and stops. There's a light on the signand another in the station's window, but the place isdeserted. PETE'S NARRATION (V.O.) I should've known better than to think that a service station in the sticks would be open at this hour, but it wasn't like I had a lot of choices.Pete looks ahead toward the town. Its few lights twinkle inthe distance. PETE'S NARRATION (V.O.) What the hell. At least there'd be a diner opening in a couple of hours. I'd get some pie and coffee, and then I could worry about the gas.Pete pulls out onto the road.EXT. ROAD - NIGHTPete's car trundles along, blowing past a hand-paintedroadside sign which reads: SLOW!

Pete pulls himself out of the driver's seat(thankfully, it's a convertible) and swims over thewindshield.But... his left sleeve is caught on the door handle. Nearlyout of breath and panicking, Pete shucks off the jacket andheads for the surface.EXT. THE WASH - NIGHTPete breaks the surface and gasps for air.

PETE Thank you, Mr. Lawson. STANTON Don't mention it. Whoever-you-are.Stanton and Maggie exit. Lardner checks Pete's ears. LARDNER Any idea how you got here, son? PETE No, sir.Lardner sniffs him. LARDNER Been drinkin' a bit, have we? PETE I don't remember. I guess so. Smells like it. (smacks his lips and frowns) Tastes like it. LARDNER Well, you've been wet to the skin. You must've fallen in. PETE I guess I did. LARDNER Lucky you got out, that water's got quite a pull, and it empties straight into the ocean.Lardner takes a shirt off his counter and hands it to Pete. LARDNER Here, one of mine. PETE Thanks.Pete puts on the shirt. LARDNER Do you remember if you were driving a car? Maybe you went over the bridge. No guard rail there, it's easy to do. It's happened before. PETE It's possible. I just don't remember. LARDNER And you don't know your name or who you are, that right? PETE (frustrated) I... no, I... I just can't... LARDNER (gently) It's okay, son. We just need to call you something. That's all.Pete stifles a laugh. LARDNER What is it? PETE Call me... Ishmael? LARDNER Well, at least you remember "Moby Dick." CUT TO:INT. DOC LARDNER'S PRIVATE OFFICE - DAYLardner is on the phone, sipping his coffee and nibbling hisbear claw. Pete is standing, nosing around the office --diplomas, photographs, knick-knacks. He zeros in on onephoto in particular.ON THE PHOTOone of Lardner and a beautiful YOUNG WOMAN. They've beenfishing, and the young woman displays a much larger catchthan Lardner. LARDNER (into phone) Stanton found him by the wash. Not hurt too bad, but he took a nasty bump on the head and he can't remember who he is. We both think he looks familiar, but we can't place him. You bet. He'll be here.Lardner hangs up and watches Pete looking at the pictures. LARDNER That's me and my daughter Adele. My pride and joy. Charms the fish right out of the lake, she does. PETE She's very pretty. LARDNER Thanks. Well, Sheriff's on his way over, and maybe we can get to the bottom of who you are...Lardner stares at him. Pete takes note, turns toward him. LARDNER ... sorry 'bout that, but you do look familiar to me. PETE Wish I could say the same thing. CUT TO:EXT. DOC LARDNER'S OFFICE - DAYThe Sheriff's sedan pulls up to the office and SHERIFF CECILELDRIDGE, 45, gets out. As he gets a few steps from thedoor, Harry Trumbo jumps out from around the side of thebuilding and stops him. HARRY (excited) Cecil! Cecil, there's a young man in there... ELDRIDGE (startled) Lord love a duck, Harry, you wanna give me a heart attack right in front of the doctor's office? HARRY Listen to me! The young man in there...Eldridge keeps moving to the door. ELDRIDGE (interrupting) Stan Lawson found him unconscious by the wash this morning, and I'm here to investigate, and if we find anything interesting, it'll be in the paper, so why don't you just...Harry jumps in front of Eldridge and grabs him by theshoulders. HARRY Cecil, listen to me!The sheriff stops. HARRY (breathless) It's Luke. CUT TO:INT. DOC LARDNER'S PRIVATE OFFICE - DAYSheriff Eldridge is seated across from Pete. He's staring athim intently. Silence. ELDRIDGE No wallet, huh? LARDNER No identification at all. (beat) What're you thinkin', Cecil? ELDRIDGE What I'm thinkin' is we got us one a'two things here. A mystery or a damn miracle. And by god I can't tell which. (to Pete) Boy, you say you have no idea who you are? That right? PETE Yes. ELDRIDGE You ever been in this town before, to your knowledge? PETE No. But... ELDRIDGE But what? PETE Well, this place sorta reminds me of something. ELDRIDGE What's that? PETE "It's a Wonderful Life." ELDRIDGE The Jimmy Stewart picture? I remember that one. Saw it over at the Bijou. So, you remember that, huh? PETE "It's a Wonderful Life?" ELDRIDGE Or the Bijou. Either one. PETE I remember the picture... but I don't remember where I saw it.The Sheriff rises and crosses to the door. ELDRIDGE Doc, with your permission, I want to bring someone in here. Maybe it'll jar this young man's memory. LARDNER By all means.Eldridge opens the door. ELDRIDGE (to someone offscreen) Harry, why don't you come on in here.Harry enters the office, doffs his hat, revealing a full headof snow-white hair. He nods to Eldridge and Lardner, andslowly turns to face Pete. He looks closer... and closer. Hesitantly, he takes a couple of steps towards Pete, whoslowly rises out of his chair to meet the old man's gaze. Finally, they're standing practically toe-to-toe.PETElooks a bit puzzled, but the old man has such a sweet face...HARRYhas tears forming in his eyes. A smile turns up the cornersof his mouth, and quickly lights up his whole face. LARDNER (softly, to Eldridge) Are you saying that he's... ELDRIDGE (smiling broadly) Shhhhhh.Harry takes Pete in his arms and hugs him tightly, buryinghis face in Pete's shoulder and sobbing. HARRY I knew all along. I knew you were alive! Oh, Luke...Pete doesn't quite know what to think. He clearly has noidea who this old man is. LARDNER (mouth agape in disbelief) Mother o'god... ELDRIDGE (to Pete) Give the man a hug, boy! That's your father!Pete looks at Harry. It's not so much that he remembersanything -- he's swept up in the moment. PETE My father...?Pete wraps his arms around Harry and hugs him tightly,glancing over atELDRIDGE AND LARDNERwho look on goofily, fighting back tears. They smile atPete, who smiles back tentatively. CUT TO:EXT. DOC LARDNER'S OFFICE - DAYHarry, Pete, Eldridge and Lardner come outside. ELDRIDGE C'mon, I'll give you two a lift back to the Bijou. PETE The Bijou? LARDNER That's where you live. PETE We live in a theater? HARRY Only one in town. (he opens the car door for Pete) Get in, son. ELDRIDGE (sotto, to Lardner) Ben, when's Delly due back? LARDNER (sotto) Tomorrow afternoon... (seized by a thought) ... oh my god... ELDRIDGE (sotto) Exactly. Break it to her gently.Eldridge and Harry get in the car. Lardner comes over toPete's back seat window. LARDNER Get plenty of rest, Luke. You took a pretty big wallop there.He turns to move away, then turns back. LARDNER Good to have you back.Eldridge starts the car and they drive away.(NOTE: Henceforth, "PETE" will be known as "LUKE." It'll beeasier to keep track of things, since everyone's now callinghim Luke, anyway. Trust me.) CUT TO:INT. ELDRIDGE'S CAR (DRIVING) - DAYHarry sits next to the Sheriff, and Luke has the back seatall to himself. He leans forward toward the front seat andtaps Harry on the shoulder. LUKE Excuse me... what's your, um, your name? HARRY Harry, son. Harry. LUKE And... what's my name again? HARRY Albert Lucas Trumbo. But you've been "Luke" since you were a baby. LUKE Ah. (taking it for a spin) Luke. Luke. I like it.Luke looks at the town as they drive down Commerce Street.HIS POVShops are open for business, TOWNSPEOPLE are going abouttheir lives. A few stop and watch as the Sheriff's car goesby. LUKE How long have I been gone?Eldridge looks at Harry, who stares ahead. LUKE How long?Pause. The silence is too thick, and Harry has to answer. He turns around in his seat and faces Luke. HARRY (gently) You never came back from the war. We were told you were missing and presumed dead. LUKE When did I leave? HARRY You joined up one month to the day after Pearl Harbor. January seventh... nineteen forty-two.Luke sits back against the back seat and lets this sink in. HARRY Nine and-a-half years ago. LUKE Nine and-a-half years... ELDRIDGE Comin' up on the Bijou, gents.EXT. IN FRONT OF THE BIJOU - DAYEldridge's car rounds the corner, pulls up and stops. ELDRIDGE Here we are. HARRY Well, son, you're home!Luke peers across the street... his mouth gapes open...HIS POV - THE BIJOU.The Bijou is a decaying, Dada-esque, grab-bag of buildingstyles. It's as though the architect took random parts of aChinese temple, a Mosque, a Pagoda, a Sphinx, a symphony halland a slaughterhouse, put them in a bag, gave it a goodshake, tossed the contents out onto a blueprint and promptlybuilt the result.As a matter of fact, if you didn't know that the place was"The Bijou," you'd probably wonder what the cryptic message " HE B J U"was trying to convey from atop the crumbling parapet.And now, the reason for the deteriorated state of the " HE BJ U" sign becomes apparent. Train tracks run right behindthe building on an elevated trestle. As we watch, a TRAINROARS BY. Everything shakes. It's not an earthquake, it's atrainquake. The "J" teeters at a jaunty angle, threateningto dislodge and tumble down to join its fallen brothers.LUKEstares at the monstrosity. His face is ashen. His heart hassunk to somewhere below his knees.The Bijou.Harry jumps out of the car excitedly. HARRY Thanks for the lift, Cecil. ELDRIDGE Don't mention it. Welcome home, Luke. LUKE (faint smile) Thanks.Luke opens the back door and slowly steps out. Harry grabshis arm and pulls a ring of keys from his pocket. HARRY Wait'll you see the inside! LUKE (deadpan) Can't wait. CUT TO:INT. BIJOU LOBBY - DAYThe interior of the theater fulfills every promise made bythe exterior. Moth-eaten velvet-flocked wallpaper hangs inshards and pieces from the walls. It's sort of a crossbetween a gaudy cathouse and a mausoleum, served up withgenerous helpings of dust and grime, an almost unbeatablecombination of questionable taste and neglect.Above the center of the lobby hangs what was -- and is --probably the only truly beautiful item in the wholetheater --A DELICATE CRYSTAL CHANDELIER.Even under a veneer of dust, the fragile droplets of cutcrystal seem to pick up every available point of light andscatter it in a hundred directions.TILT DOWN TO REVEALLuke and Harry standing below. Luke is lost in a gulfsomewhere between surprise and disgust. HARRY We've been closed for a while. LUKE (smiling wanly) Ah.Luke walks toward the auditorium doors and slowly, cracks oneopen.INT. AUDITORIUM - DAYThe ocean of two hundred or so seats on the main floor seemto be, for the most part, intact -- although the occasionalrow seems to have loosed itself from its moorings and heaveditself up against the row behind or in front.THE SCREENis really not much more than a tatty bit of yellowing muslin,framed by ragged red velveteen drapery.In the tiny orchestra pit, as we will see later, is an oldupright piano.Luke walks a few steps down the aisle. He picks a seat onthe aisle near the middle of the theater and sits. As hedoes, a CAT, an orange tabby, leaps out from under anotherseat, jets past Luke and disappears down the aisle andbackstage. Harry comes over and sits behind him. LUKE (turning to Harry) Exactly how long has the Bijou been closed? HARRY Hmmmm... after you left, it was difficult, and then Lily -- that's your mother -- she took ill and died... we haven't shown a picture since forty-eight. LUKE Why? HARRY (deep breath) Well, after the war, with so many of the town's boys killed, people around here didn't much feel like going to the movies, I guess. Some of 'em moved away -- Los Angeles, Sacramento, San Francisco. Wasn't much to keep 'em here, I expect. And now with this "television" thing -- people just aren't going out as much as they used to. LUKE Didn't you have any help? HARRY Oh, I had Irene and Old Tim but they really couldn't help much. Broke their hearts when we closed up. Broke mine, too. (brightening) But now that you're back, well, things will be different around here, that's for sure. (rises, grabs Luke's arm) C'mon, I'll show you where we live. CUT TO:INT. BIJOU APARTMENT - DAYThe small apartment above the projection booth is quite acontrast to the rest of the theater. It's neat as a pin, andfairly lit, as Harry has just pulled back the curtains,allowing the sun to flood the room.A beam of golden light falls across a table, atop which areSEVERAL FRAMED PHOTOS.One of the photos is of the real, much-younger Luke. It's aNorman Rockwell scene, at a train depot, with an army-issueolive drab duffel bag slung over his shoulder. He has onearm around Harry and the other around his mother.(And by the way, Pete's resemblance to the real Luke -- evenin a nearly 10 year old photo -- is pretty damn startling...) HARRY The day you shipped out. That was a proud day for your mother and me. Last time you saw her. Last time I saw you.He smiles. HARRY Till today.Luke sets it down and picks up another photo, that of a finelooking woman. It's a formal portrait, dating perhaps fromthe 30's. HARRY That's Lily. Your mother, rest her soul. LUKE (repeating) Mother. (to Harry) She's beautiful. HARRY (coming over) Well, yes, that she was. She certainly made this place a home.He takes the picture from Luke, kisses it, and gentlyreplaces it on the table. Luke goes over to the sofa andsits. HARRY (brightly) Can I get you anything? I can put some coffee on or some...Harry looks at Luke, who has almost instantly fallen asleepon the sofa.He goes to him, gently picks his feet off the floor, liftsthem onto the sofa. Removes his shoes, sets them on thefloor. CUT TO:A BLANKETbeing drawn up Luke's chest.HARRYstands, looks down warmly at his son. Then, suddenly, he'sseized by a thought. He turns and crosses to the window.CLOSE - THE WINDOWThere's a small picture frame in the window. Harry reachesdown, gingerly picks it up and turns it around.ON THE FRAMEIt's a single, faded gold star. One war casualty.Harry clutches it to his chest, looks over at the sleepingLuke and smiles. HARRY (softly) When I woke up this morning, my son was dead. Now, I have my boy again. (closes his eyes) I have my boy again. FADE TO BLACK.FADE IN:INT. BIJOU APARTMENT - MORNINGIt's early morning. Luke is sound asleep, still in hisclothes. In the distance, a train sounds its HORN.Luke rolls over on his back, still asleep, snoring lightly. Slowly, he starts to wake up, eyes still closed.Something's strange, though. He frowns. The train isGETTING CLOSER. Luke's eyes POP OPEN.LUKE'S POVAs the train RUMBLES BY, shaking everything in the room, Lukelooks up to see three ancient cherubs staring down at him. Harry, an elderly WOMAN, and an elderly BLACK MAN. HARRY (smiling) 'Morning, Son. ELDERLY WOMAN (smiling) Good morning, Luke. ELDERLY BLACK MAN (no expression) 'Mornin'. HARRY Sleep well?Luke is speechless. It he dreaming this? HARRY They couldn't wait to see you. LUKE Who... are they? HARRY This is the staff of the Bijou. LUKE Oh. What... what time is it? HARRY Six-thirty. I thought we'd get an early start.Luke sits up on the sofa and tries to get a little moreawake. He rubs the side of his head that is still bandaged. The elderly woman nudges Harry gently. HARRY Oh, I'm sorry, they know you, but you don't... you need to be re- introduced. Luke, this is Mrs. Irene Terwilliger.Luke stands and shakes MRS. TERWILLIGER'S hand. She's tiny,seventy if she's a day. She smiles and curtsies slightly. Her eyes sparkle brightly, her manner almost coquettish. MRS. TERWILLIGER Head cashier and refreshments clerk. So glad to have you back, my boy! (to Harry) Much more handsome than I remember him. HARRY And this fine fellow is our head usher, resident fix-it man and custodian. Luke, meet Old Tim. (to Old Tim) You remember Luke, don't you?OLT TIM is -- well, old. His clothes are a tad shabby, butwell maintained, though they hang loosely on his ganglyframe. He wears an old blue knit cap, which he quicklyremoves as he shakes Luke's hand. He's a man of few words,his manner is painfully shy -- and he never smiles. LUKE Is there a young Tim? OLD TIM No. LUKE Well, then, why do they call you "Old Tim?"Pause. OLD TIM I'm old.Harry steps forward, takes Luke's arm. HARRY Well, lots to do, so we'd better get a move on... CUT TO:INT. AUDITORIUM - DAYLuke, Harry and Mrs. Terwilliger walk down the aisle towardthe screen. Old Time lags a few steps behind. At theorchestra pit, Harry climbs the steps, crosses the pit. Thescreen is a sea of repair patches. Harry pats it. Dustflies. HARRY 'Fraid this has seen better days. Well, I was meaning to get a new screen, anyway. OLD TIM I n-need me a new uniform.Luke looks at Old Tim, then at Harry. HARRY (to Luke) I promised him a new uniform when we re-opened. (to Old Tim) And you'll get one, too. LUKE You know, I hate to bring this up, but screens and uniforms and paint and repairs are going to take money, which I'm willing to bet none of us has.Silence from the group. LUKE I thought so.Beat. Harry brightens, clambers down the steps and races upthe aisle. HARRY Anyone want to see the projector? CUT TO:TWO CARBON ARCSare squeakily being cranked together above the din of a fanmotor. A puff of smoke, then -- BZZZZZZZZZTT -- LIGHT. Ametal door is closed over the arcs.INT. PROJECTION BOOTH - DAYHarry dances around to the other side of the projector andadjusts the focus on the beam of light. The others look onas he gazes at the screen through the tiny window. HARRY Beautiful. Bright and even from edge to edge. See for yourself.The carbons sputter and die. The light flickers out. Harryis crestfallen, turns off the motor. HARRY She's always been a bit tricky. CUT TO:INT. BIJOU LOBBY - DAYMrs. Terwilliger is dusting the concession stand with aragged feather duster, a hopeless task. Old Tim is on arickety ladder, replacing burned-out bulbs in the chandelier. The orange tabby cat scratches itself on the leg of theladder.Old Tim climbs down and catches his breath. Mrs. Terwilligersneezes. OLD TIM Bless. MRS. TERWILLIGER Thank you, Timothy.They both stop their work and glance warily at the doormarked "OFFICE." MRS. TERWILLIGER (sotto) What do you suppose they're talking about? OLD TIM Dunno. Boy's smart. MRS. TERWILLIGER (brightly) Yes, he seems to be. OLD TIM Bad for us.INT. BIJOU OFFICE - DAYLuke is poring over the ledger books, adding up figures on anold manual adding machine. LUKE Um... Harry? Did I ever keep the books here? HARRY No, your mother did, then I did after she passed. LUKE Well, I'm the first one to admit that I don't know anything about bookkeeping, but there are some very interesting things in here.He scans down a page. LUKE (reading) "February 10, 1942. Picture 'Ball of Fire.'" HARRY (appreciatively) Gary Cooper. And Barbara Stanwyck. Yowsa. LUKE (reading) "Eight p.m. showtime, ninety-six admissions, receipts including concessions, $84.75... plus one fryer and two-dozen eggs."He closes the book and looks expectantly at Harry. HARRY Yes? LUKE "one fryer and two-dozen eggs?" HARRY Forty-two was a lean year around here. The war had just started... you were gone less than a month... and we were coming off a bit of a drought as I recall. Not everyone could ante up the price of a ticket, and a chicken's as good as money if you ask me. At that time, it meant a lot to the folks around here to be able to come to the pictures. LUKE Yeah, I know, but poultry...? HARRY (rhapsodically) I know it's hard to believe, son, but this place, this little place this wasn't a theater then, this was a palace! Any man, woman, child, you, me, it didn't matter, you bought your ticket and you walked in and you...Harry puts his hand on his chest and sighs. HARRY ... you were in a palace. It was like a dream. It was like heaven, like you died and went to a palace in heaven, that's what it was like. And spotless, too.Inspired, Harry stands, takes Luke by the arm. HARRY Come with me!He drags him out of the office and into the lobby.INT. BIJOU LOBBY - DAYMrs. Terwilliger and Old Tim watch as Harry leads Lukethrough the lobby. HARRY (smiling) Maybe you had problems and worries out there, but once you came through that door, they didn't matter anymore. In here, you were safe. Maybe it was just an escape from reality, but... oh, god... it was beautiful.Harry leads Luke into the auditorium. The car follows, butMrs. Terwilliger and Old Tim stay behind.INT. AUDITORIUM - DAYHarry trots down the aisle and looks up at the screen. HARRY (exuberant) Charlie Chaplin. Keaton and Lloyd. Swanson. And later on, Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert and Jimmy Stewart and James Cagney and Bogart and Becall and Judy and Mickey... and Fred and Ginger.He turns to Luke. HARRY (emphatically) They... were... like... gods!He points to the screen. HARRY And that... was the altar. Would you remember if I told you, we felt lucky to be here, to have the privilege of watching them? (sadly) This television thing. Why would you want to sit at home and watch a little box with a little screen? Because it's convenient? Because you don't have to get dressed and put on a coat and a tie and a hat? Because you can just... sit there? How can you call that "entertainment," all alone in your living room? Where are the other people? Where's the audience?Harry comes over to Luke. HARRY (emphatically) Where's the magic?He stands behind Luke and whispers in his ear. HARRY I'll tell you. In a place like this, the magic is all around you. All the time. Everywhere. In every thing.He turns Luke around and looks him in the eye. HARRY The trick... is to see it.Pause. LUKE But I... HARRY Son, I think you loved the Bijou even more than I did. You've got to remember that. You've got to.Still looking at Luke, Harry takes a step back, then slowlywalks up the aisle, disappearing into the lobby.Luke walks down the aisle. At the edge of the orchestra pit,he stands looking up at the screen. The orange tabby catMEOWS, and Luke glances toward it, standing onstage by theedge of the screen.

LARDNER (kisses her forehead) That's my girl! (he hugs her again) Did you...? ADELE No hiccups, which was good. Who wants an attorney who gets the hiccups when she gets nervous?

She waits for amoment -- then hiccups again. ADELE I think (hic!) it's worse (hic!) now. LARDNER That always used to work. ADELE Yeah, well it's not everyday you get (hic!) news like this. You're sure he's (hic!) okay? Other than the (hic!) bump on the head? LARDNER (hedging) Well... ADELE (hic!) Dad... (hic!)Lardner sits at the table and takes Adele's hand. LARDNER He doesn't remember anything, Delly. Doesn't know how he got here, doesn't remember his father, the town, the Bijou, anyone... ADELE ... including me. Right? (hic!) LARDNER I'm afraid not. He looked right at your picture without batting an eye. But it's probably temporary. He got all the way to Lawson, so he clearly knew who he was and what he was doing until he hit his head. I'm sure it'll all come back to him. It just takes a catalyst. ADELE You mean, (hic!) me? LARDNER It's possible.Off Adele's thoughtful hiccuping, we CUT TO:EXT.

ERNIE (agape) Well, I'll be...He sticks his hand out and Luke takes it. Ernie pumps itenthusiastically. ERNIE By god, Luke, if it isn't good to see you again. LUKE (uncertain) Uh, thanks.

In addition to Ernie and Katie, MEN,WOMEN and CHILDREN occupy every seat and table, and many moreare standing, even hanging out the door.At the focus of the crowd are Luke and Harry, seated at thecounter. Harry is leisurely eating a chicken dinner, whileLuke is working on a steak. A young man seated at theopposite side of the counter is speaking. He's CARL LEFFERT,30s. CARL (eagerly) Hey, Luke, remember the time you and me, we was playing with firecrackers and the one you was lighting blew up too soon and singed all the hair offa my head?A few people shake their heads, smile and laugh. LUKE Uh, no. What happened? CARL (deflated) Well... um, all the hair got singed offa my head. It was pretty funny.A couple of TITTERS are heard. LUKE Oh. CARL Even my eyebrows. But they grew back.Luke leans toward Harry, who never looks up from his chicken. HARRY Carl. Friend of yours from high school. Everybody calls him "Cueball." LUKE (sincerely) Oh, hi Cue... Carl. Sorry. CARL (brightening) Oh, heck, that's all right. It's just good to have you back. Isn't that right, Bob? Hey, Luke, you remember my brother Bob? You two joined up the same day.Luke smiles and nods at the young man sitting next to Carl.BOB LEFFERTis a good-looking fellow, a few years older than Carl. Hisface is pale and downcast, and he wears a cap pulled down onhis forehead. He looks up at Luke with hollow eyes. Bringshis right hand up, pushes the brim of his cap up. Exceptthere's no hand there -- it's a hook. LUKE (quietly) Hey, Bob. Good to meet you.Bob doesn't react. He glances away, and for a moment, hiseyes meet Mabel's. She smiles warmly. He turns away.Ernie Cole pipes up. ERNIE Luke, I know there's a question that's on everybody's mind. LUKE What's that? ERNIE Well, now that you're back, what're your plans?All eyes on Luke. He freezes, having just taken a forkful offood in his mouth. Harry jumps in. HARRY Gonna re-open the Bijou, that's what.A MURMUR goes through the crowd. Stanton Lawson, standingbehind Luke, taps him on the shoulder. STANTON That true? LUKE (on the spot) Well... we're gonna try. ERNIE That's a lot of work, son. Place's been closed, what, three, four years now. Gonna be tough. HARRY If it's tough, that means it's worth doing.Someone shouts "That's the spirit!," another shouts "Hear,hear!," and a chorus of VOICES join in agreement. ERNIE Hey, where's Spencer Wyatt? SPENCER'S VOICE Uh, back here, Mr. Mayor. ERNIE Well, come on out here so's we can see you.SPENCER WYATT steps around from the back of the crowd nearthe door. He's a tall, dark-haired, gangly, bespectacledkid, no more than 19 or 20. Painfully shy, he clutches aclarinet case to his chest. He timidly smiles and waves atLuke, who smiles and nods back. SPENCER Hey, Luke. LUKE Hi, Spencer. ERNIE Spence, that band of yours -- you think they're ready to play? (to Luke) Spencer and his pals went ahead and got together a good ol' big band.

Shelooks at him for a long moment. LUKE What. ADELE No, I... I just wondering where you've been all this time. LUKE Me too. ADELE You look... different. LUKE I do? ADELE Yeah, a little. I think you grew an inch or so. And you've lost weight. LUKE I did? Huh!Tentatively, she takes his hand and holds it. From behindthem, we HEAR A SHUFFLING SOUND. Adele turns...ADELE'S POVKeeping a discreet distance, EVERYONE from the diner isfollowing them. Adele turns and addresses the crowd. ADELE (to the group) You can all go home, now. He's not going anywhere. LUKE Go on home, folks. And thanks for the welcome.Harry comes over. LUKE I'll be home in a little while, Harry. Don't wait up. HARRY You two have a lot of catching up to do, I guess. LUKE You bet. HARRY Goodnight, son. (tips his hat) 'Night, Delly.And the rest of the crowd disperses, variously wishing thepair goodnight.

You have to help me down.AS LUKE CLIMBS IN, WE CUT TO:A LARGE, MUSLIN-COVERED OBJECT.Slowly, the muslin is drawn off, revealing A STATUE OF AKNEELING SOLIDER, praying before a soldier's grave.

The muslin covering lay bunched at their feet. ADELE Of course, there was a lot more room before they stuck the memorial down here. LUKE (looks at the door) How'd they get it inside? ADELE Through the door. It comes apart.She moves to the memorial. Squinting, she examines its base. ADELE Your name's on here. See?Luke comes over.ON THE BASE OF THE MEMORIAL -- LUKE'S NAME ADELE Right here. "Albert Lucas Trumbo." And all the others. I knew them all. So did you. We went to school with most of them. LUKE It doesn't seem right, this being down here. It ought to be where people can see it. ADELE After they commissioned it, no one could ever agree on where to put it. The Methodists wanted it in front of the Methodist Church, the Presbyterians wanted it in front of the Presbyterian Church, the city council wanted it in the lobby of City Hall. Everyone finally got tired of the fighting. So they stuck it down here.He looks at her for a long moment. There's an electricitybetween them, and they both feel it. LUKE So, you're really gonna be a lawyer? ADELE (suddenly defensive) And why not? LUKE Whoa. ADELE (smiling) Sorry. You don't know how many times I've heard that. "A lady lawyer? Are you crazy?" Like a woman couldn't be as good a lawyer as a man. Or better, in fact. LUKE Have you always wanted to be a lawyer? ADELE You... don't remember, but yes, ever since I was a little girl. LUKE What did... what did I want to be? ADELE (gently) Oh, well... I guess you... in high school, you were a pretty good first baseman. And we were on the debate team together. But... I think you were gonna run the Bijou. You were brought up there, and you loved it so much. And I think you knew how much the town needed a place like that.He turns away, rubs his head. LUKE I just wish I could remember some of this.He turns back to her. LUKE You don't have a boyfriend or anyone... you know... like that? ADELE Actually, I was married. For four years. But... well, we didn't fit together. I'm divorced now. LUKE I'm sorry. ADELE No, it's okay. See, when two people belong together, the other person should be the... the key that unlocks the rest of you... I'm not making sense, am I? LUKE (moving toward her) No, you are. I know exactly what you mean. It's not that you're missing something. It's that the other person gives something to you... that you had all the time. You just didn't see it until they came along. ADELE (smiling) Yeah...Pause. LUKE We were in love... weren't we? ADELE (quietly) Yes. (then:) Hic!She instantly covers her mouth, but it's no good. She hasthe hiccups again. LUKE What was that? ADELE Nothing. (hic!) LUKE Do you have the... ADELE I'm (hic!) fine. Really. (hic!)Luke smiles and watches Adele as she makes the decision tonot struggle against the hiccups. She has them, and that'sjust the way it is. LUKE Were we going to get married? ADELE Eventually. We were going to be (hic!) engaged... when you came back from (hic!) overseas...He looks at her. She's strikingly beautiful at thisparticular moment and in this particular light -- hiccups andall. He moves closer to her. She moves closer to him. ADELE (breathless) ... but you had to go... serve (hic!) your country...They kiss passionately. She reaches up and puts her armsaround him. He starts kissing her neck, and she suddenlyrealizes -- she's stopped hiccuping. ADELE Hey... it worked.And as she smiles and kisses him again we DISSOLVE TO:EXT.

It looks at Luke, and PURRS.Luke closes the door and moves to the cat. He crouches downand pets it, and its back rises to meet his hand. LUKE Hey, fella. So you live here, too, huh? How come Harry didn't mention that?The cat moves to the auditorium door, pausing to look back atLuke. Curiosity piqued, Luke follows the cat.INT. BIJOU BASEMENT HALLWAY - NIGHTIn the dim light, we SEE an old mop and pail, some dirty filmcans, and a large beat-up cardboard standee of "The Tramp"with the legend, "Chaplin Short To-Day."The cat comes around a corner and disappears through a doorat the end of a hallway. Luke, following the cat, comesaround the same corner and looks atTHE DOOR.Slightly ajar, there's a light coming from within, as well asthe sound of Old Tim softly humming "It's a Long Way toTipperary."Luke moves to the door and knocks. LUKE Um, Old Tim? Sorry, it's late. It's Luke. Can I come in?The humming stops, and after a moment, the door swings open,revealing Old Tim, a pipe in his mouth, holding the cat,stroking its fur.

Silence. Luke glances up at a photo atop the bureau.ON THE PHOTOIt's a much younger Old Tim, looking quite serious andhandsome in his Great War doughboy's uniform.The cat jumps down from Old Tim's arms and moves to Luke. Herubs against his legs, purring. Luke leans down to pet him. LUKE So I guess this fellow belongs to you. What's his name? OLD TIM Cat. LUKE Cat. That's simple. I like it. (pets Cat) Hi, Cat. OLD TIM (sudden change-of-subject) We thought you was dead, you know. (another new thought) It's okay that I live here? LUKE Of course.Pause, then suddenly. OLD TIM Do you think I'll get me a new u-u uniform?Luke looks up at the old man, who stammers when he speaksmore than a couple of words. LUKE I'll do everything I can.Old Tim puffs on his pipe, strangely detached. OLD TIM T-t-thank you. Thank you. I... I always... I always wanted to wear my uniform from the Great War, but your daddy, he always said no, that's not an usher's u-u-uniform, that's an army uniform and the Bijou, she's not the army.

LUKE Between a new screen, paint, plumbing for the concession stand, and about a hundred other repairs around the theater... it's going to cost at least nine hundred dollars to get the Bijou into shape to open up. MRS. TERWILLIGER Oh, my. HARRY (taken aback) Nine hundred... LUKE And you have sixty-eight dollars and thirty-seven cents in the bank. Your only source of income are my veteran's death benefit of forty dollars a month, to which you're no longer entitled since I'm alive, and these ten dollar a month cash deposits you make. What are those? HARRY (glances at Old Tim) They're... OLD TIM That's my r-r-rent. LUKE Oh. HARRY It's all my fault. I was neglectful and this is the price of that. MRS. TERWILLIGER Don't say that.

LARDNER LIVING ROOM - NIGHTDoc Lardner is fiddling with a brand-new console televisionset, trying vainly to tune in a clear picture of "Your Showof Shows." He adjusts the dials, fiddles with the rabbitears, steps back -- and is successful. SID CAESAR AndIMOGENE COCA are involved in an elaborate pantomime sketch,and Lardner fairly roars with laughter.He turns to go back to his chair, but the second he does so,the reception goes haywire. He returns to the spot in frontof the TV, and the picture is perfect again.The DOORBELL RINGS. He's torn -- if he moves, the picturewill break up.

LUKE Evening, Doctor Lardner.Lardner freezes, staring at Luke. LUKE What's wrong?

Fits okay, but it's a little big.Adele comes down the stairs. Halfway down, she stopssuddenly and stares at Luke. ADELE Oh...Awkward pause.

LUKE (interrupting) It's gonna cost over nine hundred dollars to open the place, Delly. ADELE (shocked) Nine hundred... LUKE Yeah, and needless to say, none of us has that kind of money lying around. ADELE What about a loan? You could go to the bank...? LUKE A loan to a man who ran his business into the ground and his son who can't account for the last nine-and-a-half years of his life? Not likely. ADELE Well, there's got to be a way... LUKE (suddenly) Have you got a cigarette?Adele stops. ADELE When did you start smoking? LUKE I don't smoke? ADELE You tried to once.

LUKE (nodding toward the band) They're not bad. ADELE No, they're not. I'd say your investment was paying dividends. LUKE My what? ADELE Back in '37, you heard Benny Goodman play for the first time, so you went out and got a used clarinet. You wanted nothing more than to be able to play like him. You tried hard, but it wasn't long before it was clear that Benny Goodman would never be looking over his shoulder. So you gave the clarinet to Spencer. LUKE Huh. That was nice of me. ADELE You had a hidden agenda, though. See, when he was five or six, little Spence used to follow you around like a puppy. Bothered the hell out of you. But as soon as you gave him the clarinet... LUKE ... he started practicing, and he left me alone from then on. ADELE Exactly. And he got good. LUKE No kidding.They dance a bit. ADELE Now, did you remember that, or... LUKE Nope. Just filling in the blanks. ADELE Oh. Okay.And as they dance away, we CUT TO:THE SAME - LATERON THE REFRESHMENTS TABLELuke is pouring two glasses of punch, while Adele is beingshyly admired (and having her ear bent) by two twin brothers,ALEX and CHARLIE MCKENNA, mid-20s.

CHARLIE Hey, she's doin' that movie star, what's her name...? ALEX (ignoring his brother) Hey, Delly, what was that test you was outta town takin'? ADELE It's called the State Bar Exam.

ADELE Alex and Charlie? Simple. Alex is the smarter one. LUKE That's... pretty frightening.They laugh and dance a bit more. ADELE Your dancing's very good. LUKE Thanks. ADELE It never used to be. You were two left feet on the dance floor. Like pulling teeth to get you to do a little box step. LUKE Guess I must've learned.Luke dances Adele away, a slightly nonplussed expression onher face. The band finishes the song, and everyoneenthusiastically APPLAUDS. Spencer bows shyly, blushingslightly. He nods to the band, and they bow before hemotions for the crowd's attention. SPENCER (nervously) Thanks, folks. Gee, can you tell we never played in front of people before?The crowd yells "No!," "You guys sound great!," etc. SPENCER Well, this is our first time, and it's really all because of Luke. I mean, it's because of Luke coming back that we're here tonight -- but I'm talking about this.He holds up the clarinet and scans the crowd until he seesLuke. SPENCER (to Luke) When you didn't come back, I learned how to play this so I could remember you. And now that you're back, well, I'll never forget you. (to the crowd) Luke gave me this clarinet, but he gave this night to all of us.The crowd APPLAUDS warmly. SPENCER Okay folks, here's Mayor Cole!The crowd APPLAUDS as Ernie Cole mounts the band riser. Heturns and addresses Avery Wyatt, on drums. ERNIE Pretty proud of your boy, Avery?Avery smiles broadly and beats the KICK DRUM five or sixtimes to register his reaction.ON THE KICK DRUM -- "WYATT'S HARDWARE, LAWSON, CALIF." ERNIE Looks like you might have to find someone else to mix paint at the store, 'cause I think Spencer's got a big career ahead of him.APPLAUSE again, and Ernie waits for it to settle. As soon ashe starts speaking, the crowd becomes totally silent. ERNIE You know folks, here in Lawson, we gave a lot for our country. A lot. And we never complained and we never faltered. And we never forgot.Ernie's voice cracks slightly with emotion. He clears histhroat and continues. ERNIE We never forgot. And so when one of our own came back to us, I gotta tell you folks, it was like a miracle. Luke, seein' you walking down the street, it was... well, it was kinda like seein' one of my boys alive again. I think I speak for everyone here when I say that not a day goes by when we don't keep our boys' memories alive. But Luke, having you back among us... well, it helps us keep their spirits alive, too. God bless you, son.The crowd APPLAUDS. Adele takes Luke's hand and smiles. Ernie wipes his eyes and changes the subject. ERNIE All right, enough a'that. This is a celebration, so let's have us a good time -- but not too good a time, 'cause I see just about every member of the city council here tonight, and we have an eight a.m. council meeting tomorrow morning, and I expect y'all to be there!

ADELE Sure.Alex leads her to the dance floor as Adele shoots Luke alittle "help me!" look. Luke smiles back and watches thedancing crowd. After a moment, a man in a white suit and bowtie, ROSCOE FITTS, 40s, comes over to Luke and extends hishand. FITTS Luke, you probably don't remember me, Roscoe Fitts, I'm the grocer here in town. LUKE (shakes his hand) Good to meet you. Again. FITTS Like Ernie said, we're all glad to have you back. LUKE Thanks. FITTS And I hear you and Harry are planning on re-opening the Bijou. LUKE We're gonna try. Place needs a lot of work. FITTS I can only imagine. You know, I spoke with your Dad last year about maybe taking the Bijou off his hands. I don't think he gave it very much thought. LUKE Well, he loves the place. It's his home. FITTS Luke, I'm hopping you can help him see the reality of the situation. I'll come to the point. I want to buy the property, and I'm prepared to offer six-thousand dollars for it. And that's just for the property, mind you. If you want, I'll leave it to you and your father to dismantle and liquidate the building for whatever salvage value it has, and you keep those proceeds. I just want the land. LUKE (taken aback) That's... well, that's very generous, but if you've already got a store...? FITTS The days of the storefront grocery are numbered. I plan on putting up a free-standing supermarket. LUKE (it's an alien word) A super market. Huh. FITTS You think it over. No reason to risk financial ruin for the sake of a crumbling old building.Fitts takes Luke's hand and shakes it.

ERNIE Thanks, Vera.Ernie notices Luke and the trio. ERNIE Well, the chair notes the presence this morning of Luke and Harry Trumbo and the rest of the Bijou staff. Frankly, the chair notes the presence of just about anyone who ever finds their way into one of these meetings. G'moring, folks. LUKE & THE TRIO Good morning. ERNIE I'm just guessing, but I bet it's not a sudden interest in Lawson politics that brings you all here.Luke stands. LUKE Well, no...

But I... we're... actually here on business of a sort...DALEY THORNHILL, 30s, the council parliamentarian, pipes up. He's waving a copy of "Roberts Rules of Order." DALEY Point of order, Mr. Mayor, this comes under the heading "New Business," and this is not the time... ERNIE I think we can make an exception here, Daley.

Ernie turns to Luke and smiles. ERNIE Go ahead, son. LUKE Thanks. Well, I'll make this short and sweet. The Bijou needs a lot of repairs, and the truth of the matter is, Harry, um, that is, Dad and me, Mrs. Terwilliger and Old Tim, we can't possible afford them all. So, I'd like to ask your help to... well, to scrounge around a bit, and see if you have anything that might help us out. WYATT What kinds of things are you talking about? LUKE Oh, paint, brushes, plaster, light bulbs, yardage, and if you can't come up with any of that, we can use some old-fashioned elbow grease.Fitts leans forward. FITTS So... you do intend to fix the place up after all? LUKE Mr. Fitts, with all due respect, I think Lawson needs the Bijou a bit more than it needs a super market. And I think Lawson deserves the Bijou. There's not a lot that can be done to help us get past the pain we've all felt...He looks at Harry and smiles. LUKE ... but I think a good dose of magic is as good a place as any to start.The council members MURMUR amongst themselves, then: WYATT (eagerly) Motion to encourage the citizenry of Lawson to help out the Bijou in any way they can... DALEY (a subtle reminder) ... short of the allocation of city funds... WYATT (agreeing) ... short of allocation of city funds. DALEY (enthusiastically) Seconded!

ADELE But if you only went to one meeting, why does anyone care? Besides, why should it even matter if you were a communist? PETE Come on, Delly, look at the country today. We're fighting communists in Korea, we're paranoid about the Russians, we've got this thing with the Rosenbergs and the atomic bomb... (bitterly) You think they want "suspected communists" entertaining the American public with party propaganda like, gosh I don't know, "Sand Pirates of the Sahara?" ADELE Forget about all that. You want to do the right thing? Then defend your name. If someone says something about you that's untrue, you have to stand up and say so. I know the law, and the law's on your side.Beat. PETE What about you, Delly? ADELE I am, too.Pete smiles and puts his arms around her. PETE You'll stand by me? ADELE Whatever happens.They kiss, and we DISSOLVE TO:EXT. RORY'S GAS STATION - MORNINGThere's a thick bank of coastal fog just down the road,obscuring any view of the ocean a mile away. It's deadlyquiet as gas station owner RORY, late 60s, pulls up and parkshis Model A truck. He gets out, and an big old GermanShepherd, LOTTIE, jumps out of the truck bed.Rory moves to the door, and is about to put his key in thelock, when Lottie starts whining, looking toward the fog bankand sniffing the air expectantly. RORY Whatsit, girl?He stops -- he hears something, too -- a LOW RUMBLE. Lottiestarts BARKING. The RUMBLE is getting LOUDER. Rory'sgetting worried. He looks atTHE FOG BANK.It's starting to GLOW from within. Lottie's barking getsLOUDER and angrier. Suddenly, a large black car punches outof the fog bank and tears down the road. It's followed byanother, and another -- and perhaps a dozen more cars andtrucks, all heading hell-bent-for-leather toward the town.Rory moves toward Lottie, trying to quiet her as the cars flypast the station. RORY Shhhhh. I know, Lottie. This time, I thought it was the Martians for sure. CUT TO:EXT. COMMERCE STREET - DAYThe place is bedlam, overflowing with REPORTERS, NEWSREELCAMERA CREWS, PHOTOGRAPHERS, you name it.A RADIO CREW is broadcasting in front of Mabel's Diner. TheREPORTER is on-the-air, hugging his microphone, speakingabove the din. Mabel stands next to him, his hand on hershoulder. Bob Leffert stands nearby, grim. REPORTER I'm here with Mabel Lanier, the owner of the diner here on Commerce Street where Appleton often took meals. Mrs. Lanier, tell me, what are your thoughts about having such a celebrated suspected communist in your midst all this time? MABEL Well, its kinds hard to believe, 'cause Luke -- I mean Peter -- is such a... I mean, since he's been back, I've never seen the town so happy and all. It's like he gave us some... I don't know... some hope, I guess. REPORTER What she's referring to folks, is yet another bizarre twist in this story. Not only is Appleton alive, but he's been suffering from amnesia and living here in Lawson, where, due to a startling resemblance, everyone in town for the last three months has taken him for one of Lawson's dead war heroes, Albert Trumbo... MABEL (a catch in her voice) Luke. We always called him Luke.Mabel glances at Bob, who lowers his head. CUT TO:INT. BIJOU OFFICE - DAYPete is at the desk, staring into space. Adele leans againstthe radiator behind him. The silence in the room is thick.Across the desk from Pete sits Leo Kubelsky. LEO The FBI can't arrest you, because you haven't done anything wrong. PETE Well, that's a relief. I understand they usually don't let that stop them. LEO However... you're gonna be subpoenaed to testify before the Un-American Activities Committee when they open hearings in Los Angeles. Now, if you play ball and tell them what they want to hear, they'll clear you. PETE And I won't be a communist anymore. LEO Exactly. PETE So it doesn't make any difference that I'm not one now, and have never been one.Leo stands and walks to the window. LEO Kid, don't get philosophical with me. This is a game, but it's not your game. You play by their rules, or they'll ruin you. And they have the power to do it. ADELE Doesn't it bother anyone that this is a perversion of democracy?Leo turns to her and smiles. His tone is charmingly matter-of-factly, not condescending in the least. LEO Darling, don't kid yourself. We don't have a "democracy" in this country. The Declaration of Independence? The Constitution? These are pieces of paper with signatures on 'em. And you know what a piece of paper with a signature is? It's a contract. And you know what a contract is? Something that can be re-negotiated at any time. It just so happens that the House Un-American Activities Committee is re- negotiating the contract this time around.Leo takes out a cigarette, lights it. LEO Next time, it might be the FBI. The time after that, it might be the President. But it'll always be someone. Count on it. PETE That's not the country Luke fought for. LEO Lest we forget, Peter, your own military career was somewhat less illustrious than Luke's. PETE It's wrong, Leo. LEO Peter, don't let that stop you all of a sudden.Leo pulls a folded paper from his coat pocket and hands it toPete. LEO Here. When you're called, read this to them. Just tell the bastards what they want to hear, and we can all get on with our lives.There's a knock at the door. Leo opens it. Standing thereis a small MAN wearing a serious suit and an even moreserious fedora. THE MAN Peter Appleton? PETE (standing) You found him.The Man reaches into his breast pocket and withdraws a bluebacked folded document, which he hands to Pete. As he does,a FLASH lights the room.At the door, a pair of PHOTOGRAPHERS and a NEWSREEL CAMERAMANare jockeying for position. Pete rolls his eyes. THE MAN Peter Appleton, you are hereby subpoenaed to appear as a witness before a special session of the House Committee on Un-American Activities. You are to appear in Los Angeles, California, at the Biltmore Hotel, at the date and time specified herein.Pete takes the subpoena. There's an awkward moment, as thenewsreel camera is still rolling. Pete cradles the subpoenalike an Oscar statuette and smiles into the lens. PETE ("on") This is a great honor. I'll treasure this always. Thank you.

PETE (softly) "I, Peter Appleton, do hereby renounce my membership in the American Communist Party, and by way of purging myself of my indiscretion, wish to provide the following names of fellow members to this committee, so that those persons may have the opportunity to do as I have done..."He scans down the page. It's a long list. PETE Jesus...He HEARS a "meow!" And turns to look.CATis standing in the bedroom doorway. He folds up and pocketsthe list. PETE Old Tim?After a moment, Old Tim appears in the doorway, wringing hisknit cap in his hands. OLD TIM Can I... Can I t-t-talk to you? PETE Sure. Come on in. I was just packing.Pete stands, gestures Old Tim to the chair, as he sits on thebed. PETE Please, sit. OLD TIM Thanks.He sits. Pause. OLD TIM They'll come back, you know. They'll all c-c-come back. PETE The customers? I don't know... OLD TIM They will. They w-w-will.Pete turns to Old Tim, fixes him in the eye. PETE Tim, I have to tell you something. OLD TIM Oh. PETE It's about me. OLD TIM Oh.Pause, as Pete gathers courage and tries to find the words. PETE I'm... I'm not Luke. Luke is dead. He died in the war. He's not coming back, and I'm not him. I don't even belong here. This whole thing started out as an accident, and that's all it is. An accident. OLD TIM Oh... PETE My name isn't Luke. It's Peter. Peter Appleton.Old Tim stands and looks askance at Pete.Pause. OLD TIM Did you think I didn't kn-kn-know that? PETE (taken aback) I thought you... OLD TIM I know more than you give me c-c- credit, that's for sure. Don't you see, it don't m-m-matter who you are? All that matters is what you g-g-gave us. And you can't take that away now. You're wrong, Peter Appleton. You do belong here.He leans down to Pete. OLD TIM You hafta give us back the B-B- Bijou.Old Tim straightens up, nods at Pete. Then, silently, hepicks up Cat and exits. DISSOLVE TO:EXT. LAWSON PASSENGER DEPOT - DAYPete and Adele walk slowly down the platform toward thewaiting train. ADELE You've got everything? PETE Yeah. Except a chance in hell of coming out of this intact. ADELE You'll be fine. No matter what Leo Kubelsky says, you've got a hundred and seventy-five years of American law on your side. Don't forget that. PETE I wish you were coming with me. ADELE And who's gonna run the projector until you get back? Mrs. Terwilliger? PETE Maybe we could train Cat to run the projector. You know, a system of scratching posts, and gears, and levers...They both smile as the train's HORN blows. CONDUCTOR Board!Pete picks up his suitcase and they walk toward the passengercompartment. ADELE Did you bring along something to read? PETE Damn...Adele pulls a pocket-sized leather-bound book out of herpurse and hands it to Pete. ADELE I didn't think so. Here. This is mine, you can borrow it.INSERT - THE BOOKWell-worn and scuffed, nevertheless the title is clear: CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES ANNOTATED EDITIONPete looks at the book, then at Adele. ADELE Not exactly light reading, I know. Believe it or not, I've read this since high school, and it got me all the way through law school. Besides, there's something in there that'll help you. You won't have to get very far, it's near the beginning. PETE (clearly touched) Delly... thanks, thank you. I'll take good care of this. ADELE Just remember two things. First, the law is a living thing. It made us free and it keeps us free. Sometimes it gets twisted around by people for their own purposes. Sometimes it makes mistakes, sometimes big mistakes. But in the end, the law prevails for the just. Sometimes, it takes a while. PETE Okay. What's the second thing?She thinks for a moment. She needs the right words. ADELE I'll be here... if you come back.The train pulls out. Adele and Pete exchange waves as we DISSOLVE TO:INT.

BILTMORE HOTEL GRAND BALLROOM - DAY DOYLE The agenda for this morning's special session of the House Committee on Un-American Activities shows a number of witnesses, and I'd like to admonish those that are here to view the testimony of our first witness to keep order at all times, or this chamber will be closed. I'm referring especially to the ladies and gentlemen of the press. I hope that's clear.Beat. Doyle scans the room. He clearly means business. DOYLE Call Peter Appleton.All eyes and cameras swing toward the door.ON PETEAs he enters the chamber, dozens of FLASHBULBS fire as everyeye and every camera follows him silently to his seat. As hesits, he glances behind him.PETE'S POVLeo Kubelsky is sitting in the front row of spectators. Hesmiles and nods at Pete.Pete doesn't acknowledge him, and turns back. DOYLE The witness will please stand and raise his right hand.Pete does as instructed.

PETE I do. DOYLE Be seated and state your full name and place of residence for the record. PETE Peter Kenneth Appleton. Hollywood, California. DOYLE The chair notes that you are appearing without the benefit of counsel today, Mr. Appleton. We certainly hope this means that you intend to be fully forthcoming with this committee? PETE (faint smile) I'll do my best, Mr. Chairman. DOYLE Now, we're informed that you have a statement you'd like to read, is that correct? PETE (innocently) A statement?Doyle and Clyde exchange glances. DOYLE Yes. A prepared statement. PETE Um... no. I don't have a statement at this time.Pete turns in his chair and winks at Leo.

ADELE I spoke too soon. CLYDE (ON TV) Thank you Mr. Chairman, and thank you Mr. Appleton, for appearing today.INT. BILTMORE HOTEL GRAND BALLROOM - DAY CLYDE Mr. Appleton, you mention that your home is Hollywood, California. But isn't it true that for the last several months, you've made your home in a town called Lawson, California? PETE Sir, that is true. CLYDE Mr. Appleton, do you know an "Albert Lucas Trumbo?" PETE Luke Trumbo? We never met. But I'd like to think I know him. CLYDE Is that because you were masquerading as Luke Trumbo while you were in Lawson? PETE Mr. Clyde you're twisting things around. I wasn't masquerading. Luke Trumbo... Luke was a good man who gave his life for his country. I just... happen to look a little bit like him. That's all. CLYDE (referring to notes) Yes, I see that Private Trumbo was reported missing in action and is presumed dead. I also see that you were posted stateside during the war. Fort Dix? PETE Yes, sir. CLYDE Well, I'm sure we're all glad to see you came through it all right.A few spectators titter.INT. MABEL'S DINER - DAYMabel and Bob listen to the hearing on a radio in the packeddiner. CLYDE (ON RADIO) Now, I see that you've been running a movie theater in Lawson called "The Bijou," is that also true? PETE (ON RADIO) Yes sir. But I didn't go to Lawson to run The Bijou, that was... that was something that just happened. You see, I was involved in an accident in Lawson, and I spent some time recovering there.INT. BILTMORE HOTEL GRAND BALLROOM - DAYClyde holds up copies of the Los Angeles Examiner and LosAngeles Times with Pete's picture on the front page. CLYDE Anyone who reads the newspaper is quite familiar with your... "accident," Mr. Appleton. An accident which, conveniently, came hard upon your dismissal from United Pictures. Tell us, this "accident" of yours, are we given to understand that it affected your memory? PETE Yes. CLYDE And what is the state of your memory now?Beat. Pete smiles. PETE I'm sorry, what was the question?The audience LAUGHS. Clyde nods at Pete, forces a tightsmile. CLYDE We... appreciate... your little note of levity, Mr. Appleton, but this is a very serious matter, and it merits your fullest attention. (back to business) That state of your memory now, Mr. Appleton?INT. WYATT'S HARDWARE - DAYAvery Wyatt listens to the hearing on a store radio. Spencercomes around the paint aisle, wiping his hands on his apron. He moves to the radio and listens solemnly. PETE (ON RADIO) Sir, are you referring to the fact that I was suffering from amnesia, and I've since recovered my memory?INT. BILTMORE HOTEL GRAND BALLROOM - DAY CLYDE (impatient) I'm interested in knowing if you remember things you did in your past, or if they've been conveniently "blotted out" as a result of your "accident." PETE (smiling) Mr. Clyde, I remember everything. CLYDE Good. Good. (holds up a piece of paper) Now, I hold in my hand a photostatic copy of the attendance roster for the "Bread Instead of Bullets Club" of the University of California, Los Angeles, dated October 11, 1935. A copy of this paper is before you, Mr. Appleton. Do you recognize it?Pete looks on the table and finds the roster. He's surprisedto see it. PETE Yes... yes, I do. CLYDE Referring to line thirty-seven of the document, does your printed name and signature appear there? PETE Yes it does. CLYDE Mr. Appleton, please tell this committee what was the nature and purpose of the "Bread Instead of Bullets Club?" PETE Mr. Clyde, do you want to know what I knew then, or do you want to know what I know now? They're two different things? CLYDE Start with what you knew then. PETE Well, I'd direct the attention of counsel and committee to line thirty-six of the document, and the name printed and signed there. CLYDE We see it. For the record, it reads "Lucille Angstrom." What's the point of this? PETE Well, that's what I knew then. Or who I knew, I should say. You see, I was trying to court Miss Angstrom. I went to the meeting to impress her. CLYDE (grinning) Are you asking this committee to believe that you attended a meeting of a communist party front organization in order to impress a girl? PETE (slyly) Well, if you'd seen Miss Angstrom...The audience LAUGHS. Doyle BANGS his gavel. PETE You asked for the truth. That's the truth. I had no idea what the meeting was about. I just sat through it so I could be near her. I'm sure even a Majority Counsel like yourself is familiar with the concept of impressing a girl.The audience LAUGHS. Clyde shoots a look at Doyle, who BANGShis gavel. DOYLE Chamber will come to order.Clyde shuffles some papers and looks back at Pete. CLYDE All right, Mr. Appleton. That was what you knew then. What do you know now? PETE (takes a deep breath) Well, I know that I lost my job because of one meeting I went to when I was a kid in college. I know that I've been branded a communist, which I'm not, but even if I was, it shouldn't matter, or what do we have a Bill Of Rights for? CLYDE Mr. Chairman, the witness is being non-responsive...A few members of the audience APPLAUD. As Pete speaks, theirnumbers grow. PETE (passionately) I know that a lot of good, honest, decent people, people that I consider my true friends, feel betrayed by me, not because of who and what I am, but because of what you say I am! I know that I...Doyle BANGS his gavel several times. Pete stops and the roomfalls quiet. DOYLE (emphatically) Mr. Appleton, you will respond to the questions of this committee without elaboration or speechmaking, or the chair will find you in Contempt Of Congress. You will not be warned again, is that clear? (he lets this sink in, then) Continue, Mr. Clyde. CLYDE (looking down at his desk) Mr. Appleton...Clyde takes a long pause for effect, then looks up at Pete. CLYDE Are you now, or have you ever been, a member of the communist party? PETE No, sir. CLYDE (holding up the roster) Are you refuting this evidence and your previous testimony? PETE I'm not refuting anything. CLYDE Yet you're contradicting yourself. You earlier testified that you attended a meeting of a communist party-run organization, yet you just said, under oath, that you were not now -- nor ever -- a member of the communist party. PETE That's not a contradiction at all, sir. I went to the meeting, but I didn't go as a member. CLYDE Well, then, as what did you go?Beat. Pete smiles. PETE I'm a little hesitant to say. DOYLE The witness need not be hesitant to say anything before this committee, as long as it's the truth.Pete shifts in his chair, then leans into the microphone. PETE Well, I went as... a horny young man.The chamber erupts in LAUGHTER. Even the other COMMITTEEMEMBERS are laughing, except Clyde and Doyle, who BANGS hisgavel vigorously.INT. SHERIFF'S OFFICE - DAYSheriff Eldridge and Daley Thornhill listen to the hearing onthe radio. They are both laughing at Pete's last comment. ELDRIDGE Damn, he don't wanna spar with these boys. They'll eat him alive.INT. BILTMORE HOTEL GRAND BALLROOM - DAYThe room settles. Doyle wags his finger accusingly at Pete. DOYLE (angry) Mr. Appleton, you are making light of a legally constituted committee of the United States Congress. Believe you me, you do not want to incur our wrath. PETE (matter-of-factly) I'm sorry, sir, I have no intention of making light of this committee. And I have no intention of incurring your wrath, Mr. Chairman. I have a few friends who have already incurred your wrath. They've sent me letters from jail. CLYDE (interrupting) Mr. Chairman! Mr. Chairman, the witness is making another speech. I would ask that Mr. Appleton be admonished... DOYLE (indifferent) Mr. Appleton, there is no question before you at this time, but I'm sure Mr. Clyde has plenty more prepared, and if you'd like to either answer them or plead the Fifth Amendment, we can at least get on with the business of this committee.INT. LARDNER LIVING ROOM - DAYAdele moves to within inches of the TV screen. ADELE Tell them Pete. Tell them... PETE (ON TV) (wrestling with this) Mr. Chairman, as I understand it, the Fifth Amendment pertains to self-incrimination, and I can't incriminate myself because I've done nothing wrong. Besides, incrimination is why you have Mr. Clyde working for you. CLYDE (ON TV) Mr. Chairman...INT. BILTMORE HOTEL GRAND BALLROOM - DAYClyde is still protesting, but Doyle waves him off. DOYLE Well then, Mr. Appleton, just what is your intention?Pete's sweating under the lights. He's bluffed his lastbluff, and he's on the ropes. He reaches into his pocket...and takes out the prepared statement.INT. LARDNER LIVING ROOM - DAY PETE (ON TV) I... Mr. Chairman, I have a prepared statement I'd like to read...ADELEHer hand goes to her mouth. ADELE Oh, Pete. No...INT. BILTMORE HOTEL GRAND BALLROOM - DAY DOYLE Go ahead, Mr. Appleton. PETE (slowly reading) "I, Peter Appleton, do hereby..."He stops suddenly. Pause. DOYLE Mr. Appleton? Mr. Appleton? PETE I... I need a drink of water. DOYLE Go ahead, son.Pete fills a glass from the pitcher. Nervously, he spills abit, and is splashes onto his coat. As some of thespectators chuckle, Pete brushes the water off. He reachesinto his pocket, and pulls out Adele's copy of theconstitution. The cover is wet. He wipes it off and sets itdown on the table.He takes a sip of water. Looks at the book. Picks it up.Pete's terrified, but in control. He speaks slowly -- he'smaking this up and thinking it out as he goes. PETE Mr. Chairman... there's... another Amendment... that I'd like to invoke at this time, but it's not the Fifth Amendment. I wonder if you're familiar with it. DOYLE Mr. Appleton, you will...He opens the book and reads, tentatively at first. PETE "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances."Pause. Silence in the room.ADELEShe's smiling at the TV. Her eyes are filled with tears.PETEHe looks up at Chairman Doyle. Now fully confident. PETE That's the First Amendment, Mr. Chairman. It's the backbone of this nation. It's everything that gives us the potential to be right and good and just -- if only we'd live up to that potential. It's what gives me the right to sit in this chair and say my piece before this committee without fear. It's the most important part of the contract that every citizen has with this country. And even though this contract... (he holds up the book) ... the Constitution and the Bill of Rights -- even though they're just pieces of paper with signatures on them -- they're the only contracts we have that are most definitely not subject to renegotiation. Not by you, Mr. Chairman, not by you, Mr. Clyde, not by any member of this committee -- or anyone else -- ever.Pin-drop silence in the room. Pete scans the faces of thepanel. All betray anger.ON LEOHe can't help but smile and nod appreciatively. PETE And when you get right down to it, that's really all I have to say to this committee. Good morning.And with that, Pete closes the book, picks up the preparedstatement, rips it up, pushes back his chair, stands andwalks toward the door. The cameras swing with him, andFLASHBULBS fire like machine guns. Doyle BANGS his gavelinsistently. DOYLE The witness will resume his seat! Did you hear me?! You are not excused, Mr. Appleton!And then, slowly, APPLAUSE builds in the chamber, reaching acrescendo as Pete reaches the door and exits. CLYDE Mr. Chairman! Mr. Chairman...! DISSOLVE TO:EXT. BILTMORE HOTEL - DAYAs Pete exits the hotel, a DOZEN REPORTERS AND PHOTOGRAPHERShave him completely surrounded. FLASHBULBS pop. He's takenaback, flustered. FIRST REPORTER (seeing Pete) There he is!

LIMO (MOVING) - DAYLeo and Pete sit side-by-side in silence for a moment. Leobreaks it. LEO That was quite a show you gave them today. We shoulda sold tickets. PETE I'm not sorry for what I said. LEO No, of course not, why should you be sorry? You're the new Peter Appleton. You exercised your rights as a solid citizen, first amendment, freedom of speech, all that. Very noble.They sit in silence again for a moment until Leo reaches intohis pocket and withdraws a gold cigarette case, which heopens and offers to Pete. LEO Cigarette? PETE No thanks.Leo takes one for himself and lights up. Pete takes off hishat and nervously scratches his head. LEO When'd you quit smoking? PETE Luke didn't smoke. LEO Oh, I see. But you're not Luke. You're Peter Appleton, the picture writer. PETE (laughs) Not any more. LEO Why not? PETE Leo, you were in there, you saw what I did. You think they're gonna let me write pictures? Hell, they're probably gonna throw my ass in jail. LEO (with a smile) Not at all. PETE Besides, I don't even know if I want to write anymore. LEO (snickering) What, you're going to go back to that hick town and run the projector and marry the doctor's daughter?But before Pete can answer... LEO Peter, I'm an agent. I buy lunches and get deals made for guys like you. That's what I do. You're a writer. You write pictures. That's what you do. And trust me, you'll be back doing it again tomorrow morning. PETE What do you mean? LEO Kid, you gave them what they wanted. This committee, it feeds on names. The more names, the better. But for some high-profile witnesses, like yourself, any name will do. PETE Leo, I didn't give them the names. I wouldn't do that. LEO What, all of a sudden, "Lucille Angstrom" isn't a name?Pete freezes. He slowly turns to Leo. PETE (warily) Her name was right there in front of them. They gave it to me, I didn't give it to them. LEO Well, that's not what they think. PETE Leo, she was... she was a girl I knew in college... LEO You should keep track of your old school chums. Turns out she eventually joined the communist party. (takes a puff) On top of which, she's Lucy Angstrom Hirschfeld now, and she happens to be a writer for "Studio One" on CBS. PETE (realization dawning) Oh god, oh, god, no, I... LEO So, our lawyers had a talk with the Committee's lawyers. That Elvin Clyde fella won't be too happy about it, but we cut a deal. They cleared you -- and they're gonna thank you publicly for your testimony purging yourself. PETE Thank me publicly? For what? For ruining this woman's life? LEO (dismissive) Climb down off your cross. They already knew about her. (off his look) She was subpoenaed six months ago! Who the hell do you think named you?Pete is dumbstruck. He slumps in his seat, ashen. LEO (he couldn't be happier) All of which means... "Ashes To Ashes" is gonna be made, and you've got your job back. (takes a puff) Congratulations, kid.Pete's breathing shallowly, on the verge of tears orscreaming -- or both.EXT. PETE'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAYThe limo pulls up, and Leo opens the door. Pete vacantlygrabs his suitcase and gets out. Leo shuts the door andcalls after him, waving Pete's hat. LEO Peter! Your hat!Pete comes back and takes his hat. Leo grabs his hand. LEO I was lookin' out for you all the time, kid. You did good. I'm real proud of you. (to the driver) Okay, let's go. (to Pete) Get some rest, kid!As the limo pulls away, we CUT TO:INT. PETE'S APARTMENT (L.A.) - DAYThe door opens, revealing the Super, followed by a sullenPete, carrying his suitcases and hat.

That Mr. Kubelsky, he's got you paid up through this month. You got one swell friend there.The Super moves to the door and turns back. SUPER Good to have you back, Pete.He exits as Pete reaches into one of the boxes and pulls outthe tin-toy fire truck. Distractedly, Pete puts the toy backin the box and replies too late: PETE Thanks...He sets his suitcase down and takes off his coat. As hedoes, Adele's copy of the Constitution slips out of his coatpocket and falls open to the floor.Pete picks it up and absently turns it over -- and theinscription inside the front cover catches his eye: TO DELLY, THE GIRL WITH ALL THE ANSWERS. LOVE, LUKEPete closes the book. He thinks for a moment, then glancesover at the phone. He picks it up and dials "0." PETE Western Union, please. CUT TO:EXT. TRAIN (MOVING) - DAYOur view of the moving train is from outside, as it speeds upthe spectacular coastline north of Santa Barbara. Lookinginto one of the train's windows, we SEE Pete sitting, staringout at the passing scenery. PETE'S NARRATION (V.O.) Dear Adele, on my way back to Lawson STOP. That is, if they'll have me STOP. Train arrives four p.m. STOP. Hope you can be there STOP. Pete. DISSOLVE TO:EXT. LAWSON PASSENGER DEPOT - LATE AFTERNOONThe train is just pulling in to Lawson. As it SHUDDERS to ahalt, the door of the passenger compartment opens and Petesteps out -- looks -- and his jaw drops open...HIS POVThe ENTIRE TOWN has turned out. They're all there, smilingbroadly. A large, hand-lettered banner reads: WELCOME HOME PETE! LAWSON'S FAVORITE SONA CHEER goes up from the crowd, breaking the silence. Petedescends from the train and moves into the throng. The firsttwo people he encounters are Bob Leffert and Mabel Lanier. bob sticks out his good hand and Pete takes it, both smilingas they shake hands vigorously. BOB Luke... um, I mean, Pete, if it weren't for you, I wouldn't have had the nerve to ask this fine woman to marry me.Mabel's mouth drops open. PETE Bob, congratulations! When'd you ask her? MABEL Holy moley! Just now! (to Bob) Yes, Bob! Yes!As Mabel kisses Bob for all she's worth, Pete continues intothe crowd, where he's kissed, embraced, patted on the back.ADELEis at the back of the crowd, working her way to the front. She rushes into Pete's arms, and they kiss. Another CHEERgoes up. PETE I see you got the telegram. ADELE Pete, I'm so sorry about what they did to you. I didn't think you'd come back, I thought you'd want to write again... PETE Dell, I can't write unless I'm happy, and I can't be happy unless I'm here -- and with you. (grabs her shoulders) This is me, Delly. Pete Appleton. And I love you! ADELE (tears in her eyes) And (hic!) I love you, Pete!They kiss again. Pete pulls away and looks at his watch. PETE (smiling) C'mon, Dell, we gotta go. Showtime in fifteen minutes.The train whistle BLOWS as it slowly pulls out of thestation. PETE'S NARRATION (V.O.) "Happily ever after" is a relative term, folks. My world is much smaller now, and my dreams are very different than they were. But I have something now that I never had before: I have the magic. And it's for sale at the Bijou, every day of the year. All you need is the price of a ticket.We BOOM UP to see Pete and Adele moving into and beingenveloped by the crowd.Spencer Wyatt's band is assembled in front of the depotoffice, and they kick into some up-tempo boogie-woogie as wemove up and away -- still in the same shot -- moving over thetown, settling down again to grab a shot of the Bijou'smarquee. The neon chaser lights POP ON, illuminating thesign, which reads: THE ENDThen, the letters on the marquee START SHAKING. We BOOM UPTO THE TOP OF THE THEATER, and the "BIJOU" sign...... as the train RUMBLES BY behind the theater...... and the "J" teeters loose and swings by a thread...... and we IRIS DOWN ON IT AND... CUT TO BLACK.
