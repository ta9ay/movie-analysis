Dunne slings a cue ball the length of thetable, breaking the rack with a crack like a pistol shot.The balls ricochet into each other and the cushions in afutile expression of rage and frustration. Suddenly:STORMOut of nowhere appears at the door opposite the one Hollandjust left by.  He is dripping from the rain and has a .45pointed at them with one hand, while with the other heholds a finger to his lips as if to say, "Shhh, don'twake the baby."DUNNE, FORD AND JONESdon't know whether to shit or go blind.

Somebody hand me a cue.There is a brief moment of hesitation and a look ofdisbelief between the boys and then, BOOM! Ford tries tohand Storm a pool cue as if Storm's head is a baseballand the cue is a bat. This doesn't work very well, asStorm enters and simultaneously grabs Ford's cue, usinghis momentum to slam his head down onto the edge of thepool table. We hear Ford's SKULL CRACK and he goes down.Almost instantly another pool cue in Jones's hands slashestoward Storm's head. This time Storm has his own tool --and takes his cue to intercept the one about to connectwith his head.He again uses the power of the attacker's momentum and assoon as his cue goes down, so does Storm's, onto the backof Jones's skull with so much force we hear the NECK SNAPat the same time the cue splinters in half! Storm isleft with the jagged tip of the skinny end.Dunne, knowing he'll never make it in time to the couchat the rear of the room, lunges at Storm with a butcherknife he seizes from a tray of cold cuts on a side table.Storm traps the knife, and quickly guides it into Dunne'smidsection. With the other hand he  raises the sharpenedend of the pool stick and slams it down Dunne's throatvia the windpipe!                         STORM          That's for my wife.

He's swinging likemaniac and we hear the sound of the poker SLASHING theAIR.But he gets too close to Storm, who snatches the pokeraway from him.They are like two vicious cats whirling. We see Hollandgasping in agony and hear the sound of BONES BREAKING.Storm then begins the search for Trent. He casuallystrolls through the house calling as if he's playing hideand seek with a childhood friend.

Instantly a figure leaps out. Stormgently disarms him, and the two men are for a moment frozeneye to eye.STORM AND TRENTStorm seems to drift off somewhere far away, and thenviolently slams Trent up against the wall, pinning hischest with the left hand. Storm takes the sawed-offshotgun by the handle and punches the barrel straightinto Trent's mouth. The barrel simply goes through theteeth and in his mouth. It appears Storm has made up hismind about what to do. Trent's eyes bug out of his head.Storm now takes Trent by the hair and leads him throughthe house, shotgun still in his mouth.                         STORM          You know, Trent, I want to kill you          so bad I can barely contain myself.          But I keep thinking that death is          far too merciful a fate for you,          and that a nice petite white-bread          boy like you in a federal          penitentiary ...

I          think that's best for you --Trent is now so fucking scared he looks like he is aboutto go out of his mind. About this time in their journeythrough the house, Storm has stopped before Holland'smangled and lifeless body. If you think Trent was scaredbefore, you should see him now.Storm curiously turns his back on Trent for a moment, topick up handcuffs off the floor. Trent sees his lastchance.Trent seizes the poker and does his most mighty Babe Ruthimpression. Just as Storm stands up, the poker comesflying. It looks like Storm is dead but somehow he stepsinside the arc and does shihonage, which disarms Trentand flips him backwards head-first into the fire.Trent's neck is impaled by one of the decorative ironarrows of the fireplace. He is stuck -- struggling tofree himself from the arrow as his head catches fire ...a fate somewhat worse than prison.
