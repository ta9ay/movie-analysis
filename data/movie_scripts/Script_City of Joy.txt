BIHAR - DAY (DAWN, SUMMER, MID-1980)Heat that has mass. That rises off the parched earth inshimmering waves. After a moment, we see what appear tobe figures coming out of the haze, one by one. A familywith their few belongings: HASARI PAL, 33, his wife,ALOKA, 28, and their children, daughter, AMRITA, 13,sons MANOOJ and SHAMBU, 11 and 9; HASARI'S MOTHER andFATHER. They embark toward the night, the rising sunbehind them.EXT. ROADSIDE - BUS STOP - DAY (DAWN)Hasari's Father passes a gourd of precious water. Hasariserves the children first. Shambu gulps entirely toomuch, the others forcing him to stop by a unified forceof will. Embarrassed, he passes the cup to his brother,who sips, as does his sister. Aloka barely wets herlips, insisting on leaving the last drops for Hasari.And now, a rooster tail of dust rises up behind theapproaching bus and the old parents bid farewell to theirson's family. There is an intense sadness at leavingthe land and Hasari's Mother clings to him...                         HASARI           I'll send money soon.His Mother nods, as Hasari erupts in a small cough which,by habit, he suppresses. His Mother crushes Aloka toher.                         HASARI'S MOTHER           Don't let the children out of your           sight. Not for a moment.Now the children. She wants to keep them here even asthe old man touches her, reminding her she must let themgo.                         HASARI'S MOTHER           Help your parents. Don't fight           with each other. And, Manooj,           stay away from the cinema, do you           hear?Shambu, his eyes big as saucers, whispers to hisgrandma...

There are bad           men with long knives who steal           children.That does it: Hasari's   Mother dissolves in tears, butthe old man nevertheless  unlooses her insistently fromthe children. Aloka and   the children get on the bus asthe old man embraces his  son.                         HASARI'S FATHER           A man's journey to the end of his           obligations is a very long road.           Yours begins here.EXT. ROADSIDE/INT. BUS - DAYThere's not an empty inch inside the little vehicle oron top.  The passengers are silent. A woman breast feedsa baby.  Several passengers fan themselves. Many sleep.The Pals squeeze wearily into the rear seat.                         MANOOJ                  (to his neighbor)           Our farm has died, so we are           moving to Calcutta to become rich!Hasari and Aloka look  at each other: If only it were thepursuit of wealth and  not survival. The woman under-stands. And now the   BUS GRINDS forward and the Pals lookback. Hasari coughs,   suppresses it... as silence falls.The elder Pals stand huddled   together in the dust and wesee, nestled behind a boulder   at the roadside, a tiny,blue flower -- beautiful and   fragile, but like all thingsalive, determined to live...   and we hear the sound of aDOZEN VOICES CHANTING a quiet   mantra in unison as we --                                            DISSOLVE TO:INT. ASHRAM - ANOTHER FLOWER - DAYThis flower floats gently in a bowl of water. The TITLESEND as we PULL BACK SLOWLY to reveal a dozen Anglos,several Indians, and one Kenyan seated cross-leggedbefore an aging Yogi, who's quietly urging the suppli-cants to find "their light, allow your white light tofill your spirit's eye."

MAX         Get serious.Around him, other single eyes pop open, searching for thesource of this unmeditative sound. Max nods and smilesa wry smile as if to say: This just ain't doin' it forme, folks.INT. SPARTAN ROOM - TRUMPET - DAYMax closes the trumpet case and starts chucking hisclothes and books in a knapsack and a small valise. Wenotice the Hebrew letter chai on a gold chain around hisneck. His girl friend, BETSY KAHN, overdressed somewhatin an Indian style, endeavors to exercise the inner peaceshe's been pursuing...                       BETSY         I swear to God, you never give         anything enough time! What did         you expect in five days, Max?                          MAX         Only what    they promise in the         brochure:     Inner peace, serenity,         and a nice    chant that gets rid of         this rock    in my gut. E.S.T., they         do you in    a weekend.                       BETSY         I would really appreciate it if         you wouldn't be terribly glib just         now, Max.That's okay with Max, who's willing to eschew communica-tion of all kinds and just finish heaving his stuff inthe valise.                       BETSY         Am I to assume you'll be at the         airport in Calcutta a week from         tomorrow?

Maybe you better give me my         ticket.                       BETSY         Screw you, Max -- I paid for it!         How many times am I going to let         you walk out on me and come back?                       MAX         I think only you can answer that,         Betsy Ilene Kahn.She slaps him.                       MAX         Do you really think that's an         appropriate way to get rid of your         Western rage, Bets?She swings at him again.   He catches her hand hard in hisfist.                       MAX         One slap is romantic. Two would         call for retaliation... Lend me a         hundred dollars.She yanks free, begins to chant her mantra as he grabshis knapsack and valise and goes out the door.  Now,she's silent and, in the simplest sense, deeply hurt.She can't help herself; she cares. We STAY WITH  hera moment as we --                                           DISSOLVE TO:EXT. COUNTRY AIRPORT (ASSAM) - WINDING ROAD - DAYCool, lush hills. A little pack of single-engine two-and four-seaters. Max, in shorts and University ofMiami T-shirt, hot, sweaty, appears around a bend in theapproach road.INT. AIRPORT - WAITING ROOMA small service desk. A CLERK, who doubles as GroundControl on the microphone, passing on the prevailing windand the active runway. We hear the STATIC-BACKED VOICEof a PILOT, giving his call numbers, then announcinghe's clear for immediate takeoff on the active runway.The Clerk CLICKS off and finds Max.

CLERK         Hello.                       MAX         I've always wanted to walk into a         little airport just about like         this one and ask the guy at the         counter the following question.         Ready?The Clerk nods; he's at Max's ervice.                       MAX         When's the next flight to anywhere?                       CLERK         To Bombay. Tomorrow, at one         o'clock in the afternoon.A beat --- the Clerk with his smile, Max with his, onesimply warm, the other giving off simmering heat.EXT. AIRPORT - LOW ANGLE - DAYMax sits on the ground, up against the building, playinga jazz line quietly and rather well on his trumpet. Apair of well-shod feet ENTER the FRAME. Max looks up.ANOTHER ANGLEThe rubicund face of VEEJAY CHATTERGEE, 50, and moreBritish than Churchill. Behind him, his cherubic wife,RAVI... and making her way toward the enclave of smallplanes, their daughter, MANUBAI, 26.                       VEEJAY         I say, are you looking for a way         out of here? We have an extra         seat. Where are you wanting to         go?Max's eyes flick from Veejay to the back view of Manubaias she continues on and back to Veejay.                       MAX         I'm wanting to go wherever you're         wanting to take me.                                                        6.INT. 180 FOUR-SEATER - DAYMax is crammed into the back seat with the plump Ravi.ANOTHER ANGLEWe see now that, contrary to our assumption that Veejaywould be in the left seat, it's Manubai who's flying theplane. The NOISE of the ENGINE forces them to speaksomewhat loudly.                       VEEJAY         We were among the fortunate back         in '48.  We got out of East Bengal         before partition destroyed so many.         We make mattresses. The Rajah         Double Spring.Veejay has an old flask out.                       VEEJAY         We don't have a flight attendant         on this flight...                (passing the flask)         Are you a musician, Mr. Loeb?                       MAX         Unattached trumpet player and         recently-certified associate guru.As he takes a hit   on   the flask, Max's eye focuses on thelittle mirror on   the   dash. In it he can see Manubai'seyes. If we  were   to   judge by what he sees in them, shedoesn't find him   the   least bit amusing. He smiles hissmile at her.EXT. HOWRAH STATION (CALCUTTA) - DAY (EARLY MORNING)A huge bridge dominates the skyline. The train     trundlesto a stop, its WHISTLE clearing the way. People     hang onits sides, sit on the roof... and now flood the    platform,flowing into the station, clearing a view for us    of thePals, clinging to their baggage in the middle of    thishuman anthill.CLOSE ON THEM (MOVING)Hands reach out with sweets to sell, with tea, asking formoney.                       MANOOJ         Daddy, I'm scared.

As soon as we get to         our friend's house, everything         will be fine.But, despite Hasari's charade of confidence, they (andwe) are overwhelmed by the size of the station and thedesperate energy of the humanity around them. As theypress on, a small beggar woman huddled on the platformturns her eyes eerily on Manooj... as a deformed handstretches INTO the FRAME. Aloka senses someone: Abeggar, face half-hidden and eaten away by leprosy. Thisterrifying image presses the boys tightly to theirmother and moves Hasari to encircle Armita with one handand attempt to wrap the other three inside the embrace ofhis other hand. It does not seem possible that he canprotect all of them against the predatory eyes watchingthem. He moves them quickly to a wall...                       HASARI         Wait right here. Don't move.WITH HASARIHe moves to a line of VENDORS, shows a piece of paper toone, as he digs out his precious screw of money to make apurchase of sweets from the Vendor.                       HASARI         Please, can you direct me to my         friend at this address? We are         to stay with him.The Vendor gives the address a look, shows it to theVendor next to him. Both look at Hasari.                       VENDOR #1         There's no such address as this in         Calcutta.                       HASARI         But that's not possible.                          VENDOR #1         Of course    it is possible! I have         lived here    all my life. You are         new. Who     would know if a place         exists or    does not?                       VENDOR #2         Bombay, perhaps. Delhi.     Look         there.

Stunned, Hasari hands Vendor #1 arupee and, with the sweets, turns back to his family, hisface going through a magical transformation as heprepares to suggest to the family that all is well.EXT. CHOWRINGHEE LANE - DAY (MIDDAY SUN)A few clean and cared-for Ambassador cars sweep into thegateway of the Grand Hotel, past a gateman.                                           RACK FOCUS TO:FEET - MAIDANFeet tramping the pulsating tarmac, sending up dust.ANOTHER ANGLEThe Pals, scared, dispirited, weary, consumed by thecrowd. They've been walking a long  time. Shambu cries;Aloka tries to ease his fear. They  stop numbly at theedge of the park, put their bundles down against a longwall.Across the way, a thin policeman shares a cigarette witha group of traders. There is a deeply fearful look inHasari's eyes, a look he is having difficulty controllingnow. He needs to revive the family's confidence. Hetakes out his precious bundle of rupees and gives one toManooj. Manooj, though, is fixed on the cinema acrossthe street. Hasari indicates a stall just across themain road.                       HASARI         Manooj, go and get some fruit.         Come straight back.Delighted with his task, Manooj sets off, his eyes on themarquee of the theater with its huge cardboard cutout ofKumar Kapur, starring in Hot Gun. Hasari calls out tohim to watch where he's going; the mere crossing of thestreet is a potential parental nightmare. A hand rufflesManooj's head and a TALL MAN with dark eyes and a sweetsmile comes at the boy's anxious parents.                       GANGOOLY (TALL MAN)         Yes, hello, brother. Bihar, am I         correct?                       HASARI         Yes, how did you know?

SMALL BUILDING IN BACK STREET - DAYA brick slides out of the wall.We're BEHIND the brick and see Gangooly's soft face as hereaches in and pulls out a key.The street is small and empty.  Though the houses arenothing much, to the Pals, they look like palaces.Manooj and Shambu run about in delight. Gangooly motionsfor quiet. With a flourish, he  opens the door.INT. SMALL ROOM - DAYGangooly enters, glances around, waves the Pals in.They're amazed. There's a cage occupied by two parrots.In one corner, a small altar dedicated to the goddessLakshmi is decorated with some flowers and, behind atorn, plastic curtain in a corner, part kitchen, partwash place, containing a tap with running water.                       GANGOOLY         Be free -- look around.On the faces of the family is one thought: Is itpossible? Amrita goes right to the parrots.                       GANGOOLY         They'll need feeding. Give them         seed. But don't spoil them.

MAX'S ROOM - NIGHTMax lies on his messed bed, contorted, with his feet upover his head against the wall. A book lies open besidehim. A half-eaten room service meal, many hours old,moulders on the bedside table. Max is babbling a mocksports case into his fist...                       MAX         They're in the shotgun. There's         the snap from center, the clock is         running -- five, four, three -- he         has an open man at the Notre Dame         twenty for the victory... and he         freezes. He freezes! Mr. Choke         chokes. The fans go --A KNOCK at the door. Max shuts up, falls off the wall.He crosses to the door. Opens it. POOMINA is 16,beautiful and exotic-looking behind her excessive makeup.ANOTHER ANGLE - FAVORING MAXThe porter pushes the girl gently into the room, smilingat Max, nodding.

For    a moment, Max is mesmerized by thischild; but then,   as she begins more serious ministra-tions, he pulls   back.                       MAX         Hold it, time out. Time, there's         time out on the field.                       POOMINA         Is problems, sahib?                       MAX         Is problems, yeah, just a couple.                       POOMINA         No, please, yes, I can --There's something desperate in her that makes him put afinger to her lips and say...                       MAX         How 'bout some chow?

MAX'S ROOM - NIGHT (HALF HOUR LATER)Max smokes a Monte  Cristo and watches Poomina, like afrightened little  animal, devour the last of a GreenAcres room service  meal and then wrap a small piece offish in the paper  napkin.

Now you go home.As he escorts her toward the door, Poomina is distressed.Max realizes she can't leave empty-handed. He pulls outsome notes.                         MAX         For you.She hasn't given up, though, and as he takes the money,she stands on tiptoe and kisses him. Torn, Max beginsto respond. He stops  himself, his grip on her causingher discomfort. His  breath comes in little bursts.                       MAX         You're a very wet kisser. Work on         it, get in touch in five years.He leads her toward the door. Like some lunatic comedy.she resists. He pushes. She locks her knees. He opensthe door.                       MAX         Goddamn it, cut it out!   Now, good         night.He muscles her out the  door, closes it, wipes his lips.He stares at a parade  of cockroaches gliding along thewall as he listens to  her CRYING quietly on the otherside of the door. He   debates... and he loses. Opens thedoor. Poomina stands   there; the tears stop and a lip-twitching smile lights  her face.                       MAX         Five years already? Gee, time         really flies when you have no         moral conviction.She slides into his arms, pressing against him. With hisshoulder, he closes the door, leaving us outside.INT.

He tosses it up, brings his hands past each other,then holds out his fists; she picks on... but the otherholds the penny. Fooled, she laughs.

But thenshe seesm to read something in the b.g. where we see fourthugs, two of whom will become known to us as THE GOONDA,a capo to the local "mafia" chieftan, and ASHOKA, son ofthe local Godfather.

The two of them toss off what'sin their glasses. The bangla in Max's glass is strongerthan battery acid. He does an elaborate routine involv-ing the pain, the surprise, the sheer awfulness of thedrink. But puts it down with mock machismo.

My cousin from Bihar has         just arrived in our city --                       GOONDA         They've brought a small present         -- of respect.The Goonda places a small bundle of rupees on the desk.Ashoka allows himself a disinterested glance atHasari.                       ASHOKA         So, you want to be a human horse?                       RAM         Oh yes! I have personally witnessed         his excellence -- yes.                       ASHOKA         He doesn't talk? Can he neigh at         least?                (to Hasari)         You -- do your ears function?                         HASARI         Oh yes, Babu.    Can I... uhm...?                        ASHOKA         Neigh!   Like a horse.Ashoka pulls back his lips, shows his teeth and imitatesa neigh: "Ne-igh! Ne-igh!"                       HASARI         Well, yes, Babu, I can do that.         Would you like me to imitate a         horse?Finished with the pimple, Ashoka wipes a finger on hisshirt and takes a helping off a plate of sweetcakesas...                                                      38.ANOTHER ANGLEBehind him, The Godfather walks up to the desk, puttinghis glasses on. He barely glances at his son, butwaves him out of the chair.Ashoka doesn't like it, but he steps aside. As he does,he turns a look of hatred on Hasari. Through no fault ofhis own, Hasari has made an enemy. Ghatak chews on a panand casts a benevolent eye on Hasari.                       GHATAK         Lift your longhi.Hasari does.    The Godfather looks at his legs and thighs.                       GHATAK         The wise men of our nation say that         nirvana is the attainment of a         state of supreme detachment. For         me, nirvana is counting each         evening, one by one, the rupees         earned by my two thousand and         forty-six rickshaws.Hasari doesn't know whether to respond. A glance atRam tells him not to. Ghatak gestures for Hasari tolower his longhi.                       GHATAK         You are with family?                       HASARI         I have a wife and three children,         Babu.                       GHATAK         And they must eat, heh. The         world is full of open mouths.He chews on this a moment, then opens a drawer... andholds a small, tinkling rickshaw bell toward Hasari.Hasari understands that, incredibly, he has a job. Hisbreath is so shallow, he can barely utter his gratitude.He takes the bell.                       HASARI         I shall be eternally grateful to         you. From now on, I shall be as         the youngest of your brothers.                       GHATAK         Stay loyal. These days, it's a         crop nobody plants.The Godfather turns his beatific and Godlike smile onHasari Pal.

SQUARE AND STREET (CITY OF JOY) - DAYAbout twenty tattered street kids faces shining with en-joyment. They run and shout as they pursue somethingjust out of frame.WIDE SHOTThe cause of the excitement is Hasari running TOWARD us,feet flying, as he pulls the rickshaw, loaded with a hugesack. Manooj and Shambu are clinging to the sides of themachine.Ram stands   in the center of the square. He shouts acommand and   Hasari struggles to bring the rickshaw to astop. It's    not easy and Sunil -- who's arriving -- has tojump out of   the way to the accompaniment of apologies fromHasari and   Ram and hoots of laughter from the children.Outside the clinic, a line of perhaps seventy-five waitpatiently, watching as Hasari takes off again. The wheelsof the rickshaw hit a rut. Hasari loses control, the sacktips back and Hasari is lifted into the air, feet kickingas he tries to regain his balance. Aloka and Amrita,sitting near the bawling Ram, can't hold back theirlaughter.EXT. SQUARE - HIGH ANGLE - DAYThe square is set with obstacles. As Ram shouts instruc-tion, we see Hasari negotiate them with much increasedskill. He stops in front of a small group. It's hisfamily, plus Joan and Surya.

Two lepers: ANOUAR, bearded witha sharp intelligent, unmarked face, makes his way alongon a small wheeled board, at an amazingly fast pace,ahead of SAID, a huge, mute leper. They stop some feetaway. Lepers aren't often welcome. Out from behind Saidsteps Poomina.                       POOMINA         Joan Di, my sister!

She has herself and her         sister to support. It's all right,         Poomina. Anouar, what is it?She moves to them.   They're all three badly out of breath.WITH JOAN AND LEPERS                       ANOUAR         It's Meeta! It's her time. But         something is wrong. The midwives         don't know what to do! Dr. Sunil,         could he help, perhaps?                       JOAN         Dr. Sunil isn't here.

A pregnancy gone awry.         It's a leper. Could you have a         look?Max is clearly thrown by the sight of the lepers.                       MAX         I don't have any experience with         leprosy.

Lepers --staring silently.Anouar points into a hut. Joan and Aloka precede Maxinside. Max forgets to bend and bumps his head.INT. HUT - NIGHTThe only light is the feeble waver from a candle. Theblind Meeta lies on a rough mattress on the ground. Herragged sari is pulled up to her middle. Her face runswith sweat, her hair is plastered to her face. A girlwith black eyes is fanning her with a piece of wood.Meeta sends up a SOFT, uninterrupted MOAN. A wedge ofblood-soaked cloth is between her legs.

His breathing becomesshallow... but then he pulls off  the blood-soakedbandages. Between Meeta's legs   he can just make outthe bottom of a foot. The child   is breached. Maybealready dead.                         ALOKA         Will she die?Max goes into reflex actions. Joan has opened the firstaid kit. There's a flashlight among the medicine,alcohol, compresses, scissors, etc. He hands the flash-light to Aloka as...                       MAX                (to Joan)         Pull me two c.c.'s of Coramine.He nods at Aloka; she illuminates the scene.                       MAX         Uh-oh, uh-oh, who's this coming'         down the lane? Why it's -- is it         possible -- way over here, in         India -- yes, it's Mr. Choke.He comes to a stop. Everyone stares at him. Meetamoans. For a moment, he stays frozen. Aloka reachesout instinctively, wipes the sweat from his eyes. Thisgesture seems to free him; he looks at her, looks at theroom and its expectant, trusting faces...                       MAX         I'm going to have to turn it --         the baby. Tell her she has to         relax these muscles as much as         she can.He doesn't finish the sentence. Aloka speaks softly toMeeta as Max takes Meeta's arm, makes a tourniquet.Joan hands him the syringe and he injects. Hands thesyringe back to Joan and begins to work at turning thebaby.Aloka takes Meeta's hand and it's a moment before werealize Aloka, with her fine hand, is holding Meeta'sfingerless palm.                                                       52.OUTSIDEA small group waits, trying to determine from the soundswhat's happening inside. Anouar pours tea from a pot onthe small fire, offers the cup to Hasari. Hasari staresat the cup, doesn't want to be impolite, but more thanthat, doesn't want to touch the cup. He shakes his head,smiles. Anouar drinks off the tea.INSIDESweat pours down Max's face into his eyes. He shakes itout. Aloka leans forward and, with her new sari, wipesthe sweat away again.

Only Hasari remains apart, seated on a tree stumpin the middle of the quad. He coughs; suppresses it.INSIDE                        MAX          I've got the head. Come on,          little baby, come on, little          baby. Be alive, be alive, be          alive.Aloka wipes the sweat away again.

Then he gives a lastgentle tug and a CRY squeezes out of the little piece oflife in his hands. Max is fairly overwhelmed by the lifein his hands. Poomina steps close, a smile on her lovelyface, and touches the baby in Max's hands.EXT. LANE - NIGHTMax, Joan, Aloka and Hasari walk in silence down NizamudhinLane. There is only the mingled  sound of COUGHING,MOANING, and a TRANSISTOR RADIO nearby playing a popularsong. Outside the clinic, they  stop. She takes his hand.                       JOAN         For a non-practicing doctor, that         was pretty practiced.                       MAX         Never been so scared in my life.It's a warm, open moment between them.   But now there'sthe ongoing desperation of her needs.                       JOAN         Max, please, won't you change your         mind? We desperately need another         doctor. Full-time. Think about         it -- just give us a couple of         months.                       MAX         Can't do it. Maybe you've got it         in you to be a saint. I just         don't.                       JOAN         Then what do you want? What are         you going to be when you grow up?         Good night, Aloka, Hasari.Joan goes inside, leaving Max, Aloka, and a very uncom-fortable Hasari alone a moment.

Max         Daddah, Joan Di -- is she a good         reader?                       MAX         What do you mean?                       RAM         She read this letter to me.                ( he shows Max)         But I think she must have read it         wrong. She said my wife writes         that irrigation has come to our         village.                       MAX         But that's great.

MAX            I thought that's why we've been            writing all these letters.                          RAM            Yes, of course, I love her from            here, yes; but, what if I go home            and find I don't love her from            there.Shambu takes him by the hand and tugs him quickly to theedge of the tea shop. The little boy indicates Maxshould bend close. Max leans down.                          SHAMBU            Daddy needs gold, right?Max nods.    And Shambu brings his fist up from under thetable.CLOSE ON SHAMBU'S HANDHe opens his hand to disclose what he scooped off theground during the fight: Max's necklace and Hebrewletter.                          SHAMBU            Do you think this is pretend gold            or real?MAX AND SHAMBUMax stares at the little boy's hopeful face.INT. PAL'S ROOM - FLOWERWe see the fully blossomed flower in the tea caddy andthen Hasari's fingers come INTO THE FRAME. He carefullysnips the flower free of its stalk.ANOTHER ANGLEAmrita is dressed in the beautiful sari her father boughther. Father and daughter are alone. He hands her theflower and adjusts her veil tenderly.                                               (CONTINUED)                                                      131.CONTINUED:                       HASARI         You never did belong to me. You         were only lent to me by God until         you marry and continue the wheel         of life.Amrita stares at her loving father and slowly her armscome up around his neck, the flower against his curvedback. Tears fill Hasari's eyes, but a smile graces hislips.EXT. SQUARE - DAY - EARLY EVENINGThe procession to the courtyard begins when a BRASS BANDstrikes up, accompanied by singing and shouting. Tinylights have been strung over the street. We see Max andManubai. Margareta and a group of children. Joan withPoomina. Anour, Meeta, Said. Everyone who's become partof the family is present.EXT. CLINIC COURTYARD - DAY (DUSK)The procession arrives and enters. Smoke from the chu-las. Light from a half dozen lamps.Subash and his procession make their entrance. A ritualveil is fixed to Subash's face. The Pujari waves forHasari to come to his place. Hasari turns to Max.                       HASARI         I would be pleased if you would         stand with me in the place of         honor to the right of my daughter.Deeply touched, Max nods... and the two men step for-ward... as Subash is motioned forward by the Pujari.Subash sits beside Amrita.THE CEREMONYA flame. The    shyness of bride and groom as the ceremonyproceeds with   the winding of the red thread. Hasarilooks on with   unspeakable pride, Max beside him.

As Amrita and Subash, joined by the thread,circle the flame... as we PULL BACK AND UP. Now we seethe clinic and school and the surrounding area, thealleys full of people and activity. As we continue toPULL BACK, we see the entirety of the City of Joy andthen beyond -- Calcutta, its teeming streets -- life con-tinuing as the sun sets against an infinite sky and weROLL END CREDITS.
