She had all these powders and creams in her bathroom.CASPERLet me smell it again.Telly lifts his fingers once again, as Casper breathes in the odor. CASPERThat's why virgins are the best.

You know, because she's young and all. And then I was like, oh shit, that turns me on. I wanna fuck this little baby girl.They both laugh.CASPERFuckin perverted bastard.They continue to laugh and walk.TELLYI'm telling you Casper. I think I'm getting addicted to that shit.CASPERTo what? Virgins?TELLYYeah. It's like all I think about now.

Just to see what would happen.CASPER(laughing)She's probably smash you in the fucking face.TELLYI don't know about that. She was pretty into it. But I wasn't gonna try. The whole thing is, you just gotta take it slow. Show 'em some respect.CASPERDid you tell her that you loved her?TELLYLike. Like. Never love.

That's too easy. I mean getting a virgin to suck your dick. That's so easy.CASPERIt is right.TELLYI want to knock her guard down. I mean there's a whole philosophy behind it. Having a virgin suck your dick, that's basic because there's nothing lost.CASPERIt's no big deal, right?TELLYRight. But when you deflower a girl, that's it. You did it. You were the one. No one else can ever do it.CASPERYeah. The way I see it. My outlook on the this situation is.(they both start laughing)It's like getting fame, you know what I'm saying.

He takes the chew stick out of his mouth and looks at some girl's ass as she walks by. He makes a little noise with his mouth.As the hoodlum walks by, Casper is rolling backward, not paying attention. He rolls into the hoodlum's heels. Casper falls down and laughs. Everyone watching laughs, including Telly who is still sitting with Misha.Casper jumps up and grabs his skateboard. The hoodlum is turned around.

A huge thud is heard and the hoodlum just kinda falls forward on his knees.Casper, with a big smile, steps back and kicks the guy in the face as hard as he can.Everyone gets in a big circle around the fallen hoodlum. They're all screaming. Even the girls are screaming. "Fuck 'em up!"Harold continues hitting the hoodlum with his skateboard.Hitting him on the legs and stomach.Casper is jumping up and down on the hoodlum's head.CASPER(everytime he kicks the guy he says this)Suck my dick! Suck my dick! Suck my dick!All of a sudden, all the skateboarders in the park, including Hamilton and Steven, take their boards and start smashing this guy, over and over.The hoodlum is on the ground holding his head, as everyone frantically tries to kill him.The focus should be on the face of the skateboarders. How much they are enjoying this. They continue to pound him, over and over, like animals in on the prey.This should look very scary, as twenty guys try to kill the fallen hoodlum. Even little kids are in the middle, beating the guy.Telly looks up to the sky. He makes a loud noise as he clears his throat, like he's gathering mucus. Then he puts his arms down and stops some of the kids from hitting the hoodlum. His face is completely cracked and bloody.
