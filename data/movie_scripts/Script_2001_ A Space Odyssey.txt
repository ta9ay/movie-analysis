				    				    2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY					    Screenplay						   by 			   Stanley Kubrick and Arthur C. Clark					    Hawk Films Ltd.,					    c/o. M-G-M Studios,					    Boreham Wood,					    Herts.TITLE					    PART I					    AFRICA					    3,000,000 YEARS AGOA1VIEWS OF AFRICAN DRYLANDS - DROUGHTThe remorseless drought had lasted now for ten million years,and would not end for another million. The reign of the ter-rible lizards had long since passed, but here on the continentwhich would one day be known as Africa, the battle for survivalhad reached a new climax of ferocity, and the victor was notyet in sight. In this dry and barren land, only the small orthe swift or the fierce could flourish, or even hope to exist.										 a1A2INT & EXT CAVES - MOONWATCHERThe man-apes of the field had none of these attributes, andthey were on the long, pathetic road to racial extinction.About twenty of them occupied a group of caves overlookinga small, parched valley, divided by a sluggish, brown stream.The tribe had always been hungry, and now it was starving.As the first dim glow of dawn creeps into the cave, Moonwatcherdiscovers that his father has died during the night. He did not knowthe Old One was his father, for such a relationship was beyondhis understanding. but as he stands looking down at the emac-iated body he feels something, something akin to sadness. Thenhe carries his dead father out of the cave, and leaves him for thehyenas.Among his kind, Moonwatcher is almost a giant. He is nearlyfive feet high, and though badly undernourished, weighs overa hundred pounds. His hairy, muscular body is quite man-like,and his head is already nearer man than ape. The forehead islow, and there are great ridges over the eye-sockets, yet heunmistakably holds in his genes the promise of humanity. Ashe looks out now upon the hostile world, there is already										 a2A2CONTINUEDsomething in his gaze beyond the grasp of any ape. In thosedark, deep-set eyes is a dawning awareness-the first intima-tions of an intelligence which would not fulfill itself for anothertwo million years.										 a3A3EXT  THE STREAM - THE OTHERSAs the dawn sky brightens, Moonwatcher and his tribe reachthe shallow stream.The Others are already there. They were there on the otherside every day - that did not make it any less annoying.There are eighteen of them, and it is impossible to distinguishthem from the members of Moonwatcher's own tribe. Asthey see him coming, the Others begin to angrily dance andshriek on their side of the stream, and his own people replyIn kind.The confrontation lasts a few minutes - then the display diesout as quickly as it has begun, and everyone drinks his fill ofthe muddy water. Honor has been satisfied - each group hasstaked its claim to its own territory.										 a4A4EXT  AFRICAN PLAIN - HERBIVORESMoonwatcher and his companions search for berries, fruitand leaves, and fight off pangs of hunger, while all aroundthem, competing with them for the samr fodder, is a potentialsource of more food than they could ever hope to eat. Yetall the thousands of tons of meat roaming over the parchedsavanna and through the brush is not only beyond their reach;the idea of eating it is beyond their imagination. They areslowly starving to death in the midst of plenty.										 a5A5EXT  PARCHED COUNTRYSIDE - THE LIONThe tribe slowly wanders across the bare, flat country-side foraging for roots and occasional berries.Eight of them are irregularly strung out on the open plain,about fifty feet apart.The ground is flat for miles around.Suddenly, Moonwatcher becomes aware of a lion, stalkingthem about 300 yards away.Defenceless and with nowhere to hide, they scatter in alldirections, but the lion brings one to the ground.										 a6A6EXT  DEAD TREE - FINDS HONEYIt had not been a good day, though as Moonwatcher had noreal remembrance of the past he could not compare one daywith another. But on the way back to the caves he finds ahive of bees in the stump of a dead tree, and so enjoys thefinest delicacy his people could ever know. Of course, healso collects a good many stings, but he scacely noticesthem. He is now as near to contentment as he is everlikely to be; for thought he is still hungry, he is not actuallyweak with hunger. That was the most that any hominid couldhope for.										 a7A7INT & EXT  CAVES - NIGHT TERRORSOver the valley, a full moon rises, and a cold wind blows downfrom the distant mountains. It would be very cold tonight -but cold, like hunger, was not a matter for any real concern;it was merely part of the background of life.This Little Sun, that only shone at night and gave no warmth,was dangerous; there would be enemies abroad. Moonwatchercrawls out of the cave, clambers on to a large boulder besidesthe entrance, and squats there where he can survey the valley.If any hunting beast approached, he would have time to get backto the relative safety of the cave.Of all the creatures who had ever lived on Earth, Moonwatcher'srace was the first to raise their eyes with interest to the Moon,and though he could not remember it, when he was young,Moonwatcher would reach out and try to touch its ghostly face.Now he new he would have to find a tree that was highenough.He stirs when shrieks and screams echo up the slope fromone of the lower caves, and he does not need to hear the										 a8A7CONTINUEDoccasional growl of the lion to know what is happening. Downthere in the darkness, old One-Eye and his family are dying,and the thought that he might help in some way never crossesMoonwatcher's mind. The harsh logic of survival rules outsuch fancies. Every cave is silent, lest it attract disaster.And in the caves, in tortured spells of fitful dozing andfearful waiting, were gathered the nightmares of generationsyet to come.										 a9A8EXT  THE STREAM - INVASIONThe Others are growing desperate; the forage on their side ofthe valley is almost exhausted. Perhaps they realise thatMoonwatcher's tribe has lost three of its numbers during thenight, for they choose this mourning to break the truce. Whenthey meet at the river in the still, misty dawn, there is adeeper and more menacing note in their challenge. The noisybut usually harmless confrontation lasts only a few secondsbefore the invasion begins.In an uncertainly-moving horde, the Others cross the river,shieking threats and hunched for the attack. They are ledby a big-toothed hominid of Moonwatcher's own size and age.Startled and frightened, the tribe retreats before the firstadvance, throwing nothing more substantial than imprecationsat the invaders. Moonwatcher moves with them, his mind amist of rage and confusion. To be driven from their ownterritory is a great badness, but to lose the river is death.He does not know what to do; it is a situation beyond hisexperience.Then he becomes dimly aware that the Others are slowing										 a10A8CONTINUEDdown, and advancing with obvious reluctance. The further theymove from their own side, the more uncertain and unhappythey become. Only Big-Tooth still retains any of his originaldrive, and he is rapidly being seperated from his followers.As he sees this, Moonwatcher's own morale immediatelyrevives. He slows down his retreat, and begins to makereassuring noises to his companions. Novel sensations fillhis dim mind - the first faint precursors of bravery andleadership.Before he realizes it, he is face to face with Big-Tooth, andthe two tribes come to a halt many paces away.The disorganized and unscientific conflict could have endedquickly if either had used his fist as a club, but thisinnovation still lay hundreds of thousands of years in thefuture. Instead, the slowly weakening fighters claw andscratch and try to bite each other.Rolling over and over, they come to a patch of stony ground,and when they reach it Moonwatcher is on top. By chance,										 a11A8CONTINUEDhe chooses this moment to grab the hair on Big-Tooth's scalp,and bang his head on the ground. The resulting CRACK isso satisfactory, and produces such an immediate weakeningIn Big - Tooth's resistance, that he quickly repeats it.Even when Big-Tooth ceases to move for some time, Moon-watcher keeps up the exhilirating game.With shrieks of panic, the Others retreat back, across thestream. The defenders cautiously pursue them as far asThe water's edge.										 a12EXT  CAVE - NEW SOUNDDozing fitfully and weakened by his stuggle, Moonwatcher isstartled by a sound.He sits up in the fetid darkness of the cave, straining hissenses out into the night, and fear creeps slowly into his soul.Never in his life - already twice as long as most members ofhis species could expect - has he heard a sound like this. Thegreat cats approached in silence, and the only thing thatbetrayed them was a rare slide of earth, or the occasionalcracking of a twig. Yet this is a continuing crunching noisethat grows steadily louder. It seemed that some enormousbeast was moving through the night, making no attempt atconcealment, and ignoring all obstacles.And then there came a sound which Moonwatcher could notpossibly have identified, for it had never been heard beforein the history of this planet.										 a13A10EXT CAVE - NEW ROCKMoonwatcher comes face to face with the New Rock when heleads the tribe down to the river in the first light of morning.He had almost forgotten the terror of the night, because nothinghad happened after that initial noise, so he does not evenassociate this strange thing with danger or with fear. Thereis nothing in the least alarming about it.It is a cube about fifteen feet on a side, and it is made ofsome completely transparent material; indeed, it is not easyto see except when the light of the sun glints on its edges.There are no natural objects to which Moonwatcher cancompare this apparition. Though he is wisely cautiousof most new things, he does not hesitate to walk up to it.As nothing happens, he puts out his hand, and feels a warm,hard surface.After several minutes of intense thought, he arrives at abrilliant explanation. It is a rock, of course, and itmust have grown during the night. There are many plantsthat do this - white, pulpy things shaped like pebbles, thatseem to shoot up in the hours of darkness. It is true thatthey are small and round, whereas this is large and square;										 a14A10CONTINUEDbut greater and later philosophers than Moonwatcher would beprepared to overlook equally striking exceptions to their laws.This really superb piece of abstract thinking leads Moonwatcherto a deduction which he immediately puts to the test. The white,round pebble-plants are very tasty (though there were a fewthat made one violently sick); perhaps this square one...?A few licks and attempted nibbles quickly disillusion him.There is no nourishment here; so like a sensible hominid, hecontinues on his way to the river and forgets all about the Cube.										 a15A11EXT CUBE - FIRST LESSONThey are still a hundred yards from the New Rock when thesound begins.It is quite soft, and it stops them in their tracks, so that theystand paralyzed on the trail with their jaws hanging. A simple,maddeningly repetitious rhythm pulses out of the crystal cubeand hypnotises all who come within its spell. For the firsttime - and the last, for two million year - the sound ofdrumming is heard in Africa.The throbbing grows louder, more insistent. Presently thehominids begin to move forward like sleep-walkers, towardsthe source of that magnetic sound. Sometimes they take littledancing steps, as their blood responds to the rhythms thattheir descendants will not create for ages yet.Totally entranced, they gather around the Cube, forgettingthe hardships of the day, the perils of the approaching dusk,and the hunger in their bellies.Now, spinning wheels of light begin to merge, and the spokesfuse into luminous bars that slowly recede into the distance,										 a16A11CONTINUEDrotating on their axes as they do; and the hominids watch, wide-eyed, mesmerized captives of the Crystal Cube.Then by some magic - though it was no more magical than allthat had gone on before - a perfectly normal scene appears. Itis as if a cubical block had been carved out of the day andshifted into the night. Inside that block is a group of fourhominids, who might have been members of Moonwatcher'sown tribe, eating chunks of meat. The carcass of a wart-hoglies near them.This little family of male and female and two children is gorgedand replete, with sleek and glossy pelts - and this was acondition of life that Moonwatcher had never imagined. Fromtime to time they stir lazily, as they loll at ease near theentrance of their cave, apparently at peace with the world.The spectacle of domestic bliss merges into a totallydifferent scene.The family is no longer reposing peacefully outside its cave;it is foraging, searching for food like any normal hominids.										 a17A11CONTINUEDA small wart-hog ambles past the group of browsing humanoidswithout giving them more than a glance, for they had never beenthe slightest danger to its species.But that happy state of affairs is about to end. The big malesuddenly bends down, picks up a heavy stone lying at his feet -and hurls it upon the unfortunate pig. The stone descends uponits skull, making exactly the same noise that Moonwatcher hadproduced in his now almost forgotten encounter with Big-Tooth.And the result, too, is much the same - the warthog gives oneamazed, indignant squeal, and collapses in a motionless heap.Then the whole sequence begins again, but this time it unfoldsitself with incredible slowness. Every detail of the movementcan be followed; the stone arches leisurely through the air, thepig crumples up and sinks to the ground. There the scenefreezes for long moments, the slayer standing motionlessabove the slain, the first of all weapons in his hand.The scene suddenly fades out. The cube is no more than aglimmering outline in the darkness; the hominids stir, as if										 a18A11CONTINUEDawakening from a dream, realise where they are, and scuttleback to their caves.They have no concious memory of what they had seen; but thatnight, as he sits brooding at the entrance of his lair, his earsattuned to the noises of the world around him, Moonwatcherfeels the first faint twinges of a new and potent emotion - the urgeto kill. He had taken his first step towards humanity.										 a19A12EXT cave AND PLAINS - UtopiaBabies were born and sometimes lived; feeble, toothless thirty-year-olds died; the lion took its toll in the night; the Othersthreatened daily across the river - and the trib prospered.In the course of a single year, Moonwatcher and his companionshad changed almost beyond recognition.They had become as plump as the family in the Cave, who nolonger haunted their dreams. They had learned their lessonswell; now they could handle all the stone tools and weapons thatthe Cube had revealed to them.They were no longer half-numbed with starvation, and theyhad time both for leisure and for the first rudiments of thought.Their new way of life was casually accepted, and they didnot associate it in any way with the crystal cube still standingoutside their cave.But no Utopia is perfect, and this one had two blemishes. Thefirst was the marauding lion, whose passion for hominidsseemed to have grown even stronger now that they were betternourished. The second was the tribe across the river; for										 a20A12CONTINUEDsomehow the Others had survived, and had stubbornly refused todie of starvation.										 a21A13EXT CAVES - KILLING THE LIONWith the partly devoured carcass of a warthog laid out on theground at the point he hope the boulder would impact, Moon-watcher and three of his bravest companions wait for twoconsecutive nights. On the third the lion comes,betraying his presences by a small pebble slide.When they can here the lion below, softly tearing at the meat,they strain themselves against the massive boulder. The soundof the lion stops; he is listening. Again they silently heaveagainst the enormous stone, exerting the final limits of theirstrength. The rock begin to tip to a new balance point.The lion twitches alert to this sound, but having no fear of thesecreatures, he makes the first of two mistakes which will costhim his life; he goes back to his meal.The rock moves slowly over the ledge, picking up speed withamazing suddeness. It strikes a projection in the cliff aboutfifteen feet above the ground, which deflects its path outward.Just at this instant, the lion reacts instinctively and leapsaway from the face of the cliff directly into the path of the										 a22A13CONTINUEDonrushing boulder. He has combined the errors of over-confidence and bad luck.The next morning they find the lion in front of the cave. Theyalso find one of their tribe who had incautiously peeped out tosee what was happening, and was apparently killed by a smallrock torn loose by the boulder; but this was a small price topay for such a great victory.					  * * * * * * * *And then one night the crystal cube was gone, and not evenMoonwatcher ever thought of it again. He was still whollyunaware of all that it had done.										 a23A14EXT STREAM - MASTER OF THE WORLDFrom their side of the stream, in the never violated safety oftheir own territory, the Others see Moonwatcher and fourteenmales of his tribe appear from behind a small hillock over-looking the stream, silhouetted against the dawn sky.The Others begin to scream their daily challenge. But todaysomething is different, though the Others do not immediatlyrecognize this fact.Instead of joining the verbal onslaught, as they had always done,Moonwatcher and his small band decended from the rise, andbegin to move forward to the stream with a quiet purposefulnessnever befor seen.As the Others watch the figures silently approaching in themorning mist, they become aware of the terrible strangnessof this encounter, and their rage gradually subsides down toan uneasy silence.At the water's edge, Moonwatcher and his band stop. Theycarry their bone clubs and bone knives.										 a24A14CONTINUEDLed by One-ear, the Others half-heartly resume the battle-chant. But they are suddenly confrunted with a vision that cutsthe sound from their throats, and strikes terror into theirhearts.Moonwatcher, who had been partly concealed by two males whowalked before him, thrusts his arm high into the air. In hishand he holds a stoud tree branch. Mounted atop the branch isthe bloody head of the lion, its mouth jammed open with a stick,displaying its frightful fangs.The Others gape in fearful disbelief at this display of power.Moonwatchers stands motionless, thrusting the lion's head high.Then with majestic deliberation, still carrying his mangledstandard above his head, he begins to cross the stream, followedby his band.The Others fade back from the stream, seeming to lack eventhe ability to flee.Moonwatcher steps ashore and walks to One-Ear, who stands										 a25A14CONTINUEDunsurely in front of his band.Though he is a veteran of numerous combats at the water's edge,One-Ear has never been attacked by an enemy who had not firstdisplayed his fighting rage; and he had never before been attackedwith a weapon. One-Ear, merely looks up at the raised clubuntil the heavey thigh bone of an antelope brings the darknessdown around him.The Others stare in wonder at Moonwatcher's power.Moonwatcher surveys the scene. Now he was master of theworld, and he was not sure what to do next. But he wouldthink of something.										 a26					    A SECTION TIMING			    A1    00.30			    A2    00.45			    A3    01.30			    A4    00.30			    A5    01.00			    A6    01.00			    A7    01.00			    A8    03.00			    A9    00.45			    A10   02.00			    A11   04.00			    A12   02.00			    A13   02.30			    A14   02.30					    A SECTION TOTAL: @23 MIN. 00 SECS 			    TITLE					PART II							    YEAR 2001											    a26a B1EARTH FROM 200 MILES UP					 NARRATOR								    By the year 2001, overpopulation hasB1a						 replaced the problem of starvationTHOUSAND MEGATON			   but this was ominously offset by theNUCLEAR BOMB IN ORBIT		   absolute and utter perfection of theABOVE THE EARTH,			   weapon.RUSSIAN INSIGNIA ANDCCCP MARKINGSB1b							 NARRATORAMERICAN THOUSAND			  Hundreds of giant bombs had beenMEGATON BOMB IN ORBIT		   placed in perpetual orbit above theABOVE THE EARTH.

SMYSLOV					    Are you quite sure?					    FLOYD					    Yes, really, thank you very					    much.					    ELENA					    Well...

FLOYD					    Oh, she's growing up very fast.					    As a matter of fact, she's six					    tomorrow.					    ELENA					    Oh, that's such a delightful age.

We've just					    spent three months calibrating					    the new antenna at Tchalinko.					    And what about you?					    FLOYD					    Well, as it happens, I'm on					    my way up to the moon					    SMYSLOV					    Are you, by any chance, going					    up to your base at Clavius?					    FLOYD					    Yes,as a matter of fact, I am.THE RUSSIANSEXCHANGESIGNIFICANTGLANCES					    FLOYD					    Is there any particular reason					    why you ask?12/7/65										  b31 B20CONTINUED					    SMYSLOV					    (pleasantly)  Well, Dr. Floyd,					    I hope that you don't think I'm					    too inquisitive, but perhaps					    you can clear up the mystery					    about what's been going on up					    there.					    FLOYD					    I'm sorry, but I'm not sure					    I know what you mean.					    SMYSLOV					    Well, it's just for the past					    two weeks there have been					    some extremely odd things					    happening at Clavius.					    FLOYD					    Really?					    SMYSLOV					    Yes. Well, for one thing,					    whenever you phone the base,					    all you can get is a recording					    which repeats that the phone					    lines are temporarily out of					    order.12/7/65										  b32 B20CONTINUED					    FLOYD					    Well, I suppose they've been					    having a bit of trouble with					    some of the equipment.					    SMYSLOV					    Yes, well at first we thought					    that was the explanation, but					    it's been going on for the past					    ten days.					    FLOYD					    You mean you haven't been able					    to get anyone at the base for ten					    days?					    SMYSLOV					    That's right.					    FLOYD					    I see.					    ELENA					    Another thing, Heywood, two					    days ago, one of our rocket					    buses was denied permission					    for an emergency landing at					    Clavius.12/7/65										  b33 B20CONTINUED					    FLOYD					    How did they manage to do that					    without any communication?					    ELENA					    Clavius Control came on the					    air just long enough to transmit					    their refusal.					    FLOYD					    Well, that does sound very odd.					    SMYSLOV					    Yes, and I'm afaid there's					    going to be a bit of a row about					    it. Denying the men permission					    to land was a direct violation of					    the I.A.S. convention.					    FLOYD					    Yes... Well, I hope the crew					    got back safely.					    SMYSLOV					    Fortunately, they did.					    FLOYD					    Well, I'm glad about that.12/7/65										  b33a B20CONTINUEDTHE RUSSIANS EXCHANGEMORE GLANCES.

FLOYD					    Certainly.					    SMYSLOV					    Quite frankly, we have had some					    very reliable intelligence reports					    that a quite serious epidemic					    has broken out at Clavius.

SMYSLOV					    This epidemic could easily					    spread to our base, Dr. Floyd.					    We should be given all the					    facts.LONG PAUSE					    FLOYD					    Dr. Smyslov... I'm not					    permitted to discuss this.					    ELENA					    Are you sure you won't change					    your mind about a drink?					    FLOYD					    No, thank you... and I'm					    afraid now I really must be					    going.					    ELENA					    Well, I hope that you and your					    wife can come to the I.A.C.					    conference in June.12/7/65										  b33c  B20CONTINUED					    FLOYD					    We're trying to get there.

CO-PILOT					    Berkeley told me that they think					    it came from contamination on a					    returning Mars flight.

You					    see, I've got a girl who works in					    the Auditing Department of the					    Territorial Administrator and I					    haven't been able to get her on					    the phone for the past week or so,					    and with all these stories one					    hears, I'm a little concerned					    about her.					    FLOYD					    I see. Well, I'm sorry about that.					    I wouldn't think there's any cause					    for alarm.					    PILOT					    Yes, well, I wouldn't have been					    too concerned about it, except					    I've heard these stories about the					    epidemic and, as a matter of fact,					    I've heard that ten people have					    died already.12/14/65										 b40 B24CONTINUED					    FLOYD					    I wish I could be more helpful,					    Captain, but as I've said, I don't					    think there's any cause for					    alarm.

FLOYD					    First of all, I bring a personal					    message from Dr. Howell, who					    has asked me to convey his					    deepest appreciation to all of					    you for the personal sacrifices					    you have made, and of course					    his congratulations on your					    discovery which may well prove					    to be among the most significant					    in the history of science.POLITE APPLAUSE.11/25/65										 b54 B38CONTINUED					    FLOYD (cont'd)					    Mr. Halvorsen has made known					    to me some of the conflicting					    views held by many of you					    regarding the need for complete					    security in this matter, and					    more specifically your strong					    opposition to the cover story					    created to give the impression					    there is an epidemic at the Base.					    I understand that beyond it being					    a matter of principle, many of					    you are troubled by the concern					    and anxiety this story of an					    epidemic might cause your					    relatives and friends on Earth.					    I can understand and sympathize					    with your negative views. I have					    been personally embarrassed by					    this cover story. But I fully					    accept the need for absolute					    secrecy and I hope you will.					    It should not be difficult for all					    of you to realise the potential for					    cutural shock and social					    disorientation contained in the					    present situation if the facts					    were prematurely and suddenly					    made public without adequate					    preparation and conditioning.11/25/65										 b55 B38CONTINUED					    FLOYD					    This is the view of the Council					    and the purpose of my visit here					    is to gather addition facts and					    opinions on the situation and to					    prepare a report to the Council					    recommending when and how the					    news should eventually be					    announced. Are there any					    questions?					    MICHAELS					    Dr. Floyd, how long do you think					    this can be kept under wraps?					    FLOYD					    (pleasantly)					    I'm afraid it can and it will be					    kept under wraps as long as it					    is deemed to be necessary by					    the Council. And of course you					    know that the Council has requested					    that formal security oaths are to					    be obtained in writing from every-					    one who had any knowledge of this					    event. There must be adequate					    time for a full study to be made					    of the situation before any con-					    sideration can be given to					    making a public announcement.11/25/65										 b56 B38CONTINUED					    HALVORSEN					    We will, of course, cooperate					    in any way possible, Dr. Floyd.11/25/65										 b56a B39SEVERAL SCENIC VIEWS OFMOON ROCKET BUS SKIMMINGOVER SURFACE OF MOON.10/5/65										  b57 B40INSIDE ROCKET BUS,FLOYD, HALVORSEN,MICHAELS, FOURTHMAN, PILOT ANDCO-PILOT.

NARRATOR					    All these things and many others					    were patiently noted by Deep-					    Space-Monitor-79, and recorded					    in its crystalline memory.11/25/65										 b68 B47CONTINUED					    NARRATOR					    But now it had noted something					    strange - the faint yet					    unmistakable distrubance rippling					    across the solar system, and					    quite unlike any natural phenomena					    it had ever observed in the past.					    NARRATOR					    It was also observed by Orbiter					    M-15, circling Mars twice a					    day; and High Inclination Probe-					    21, climbing slowly above the					    planet of the ecliptic; and even					    artificial Comet-5, heading out					    into the cold wastes beyond					    Pluto, along an orbit whose					    far point it would not reach for					    a thousand years.					    NARRATOR					    All noticed the peculiar burst of					    energy that leaped from the face					    of the Moon and moved across					    the solar system, throwing off a					    spray of radiation like the wake of					    a racing speedboat.11/25/65										 b69 B SECTION TIMINGB1-1f	00.50			B25	00.10  B2	   00.10			B26	00.20B3	   00.15			B27	00.05B4	   00.15			B28	OutB5	   00.20			B29	00.30B6	   00.15			B30	00.30B7	   00.10			B31	00.25B8	   00.15			B32	00.20B9	   00.10			B33	00.20B10	  00.10			B34	00.30B11	  00.15			B35	00.20B12	  00.50			B36	00.20B13	  01.10			B37	00.30B14	  00.35			B38	02.15B15	  Out			  B39	00.20B16	  Out			  B40	00.50B17	  01.15			B41	00.15B18	  00.15			B42	00.10B19	  01.00			B43	00.15B20	  03.55			B44	01.40B21	  00.20			B45	00.20B21A	 00.20			B46	00.40B21B	 00.15			B47	01.25B22	  01.00B23	  00.10B24	  01.30B SECTION TOTAL:  28 MIN. 10 SECS.TITLE					    PART III					    14 MONTHS LATER											    b69aC1DISCOVERY 1,000,000MILES FROM EARTH.SEE EARTH AND MOONSMALL.WE SEE A BLINDINGFLASH EVERY 5SECONDS FROM ITSNUCLEAR PULSEPROPULSION.

POOLE					    Dave, if you've a minute, I'd like					    your advice on something.					    BOWMAN					    Sure, what is it?					    POOLE					    Well, it's nothing really important,					    but it's annoying.					    BOWMAN					    What's up?					    POOLE					    It's about my salary cheques.					    BOWMAN					    Yes?					    POOLE					    Well I got the papers on my					    official up-grading to AGS-19					    two weeks before we left.12/14/65										 c12 C12CONTINUED					    BOWMAN					    Yes, I remember you mentioning it.					    I got mine about the same time.					    POOLE					    That's right. Well, naturally,					    I didn't say anything to Payroll.					    I assumed they'd start paying me					    at the higher grade on the next pay					    cheque. But it's been almost					    three weeks now and I'm still					    being paid as an AGS-18.					    BOWMAN					    Interesting that you mention it,					    because I've got the same problem.					    POOLE					    Really.					    BOWMAN					    Yes.					    POOLE					    Yesterday, I finally called the					    Accounting Office at Mission					    Control, and all they could tell me					    was that they'd received the AGS-19					    notification for the other three but					    not mine, and apparently not yours					    either.12/14/65										 c13 C12CONTINUED					    BOWMAN					    Did they have any explanation for					    this?					    POOLE					    Not really. They just said it might					    be because we trained at Houston and					    they trained in Marshall, and that					    we're being charged against differ-					    ent accounting offices.					    BOWMAN					    It's possible.					    POOLE					    Well, what do you think we ought					    to do about it?					    BOWMAN					    I don't think we should make any					    fuss about it yet. I'm sure they'll					    straighten it out.					    POOLE					    I must say, I never did understand					    why they split us into two groups					    for training.					    BOWMAN					    No. I never did, either.12/14/65										 c14 C12CONTINUED					    POOLE					    We spent so little time with them,					    I have trouble keeping their names					    straight.					    BOWMAN					    I suppose the idea was specialized					    training.					    POOLE					    I suppose so. Though, of course,					    there's a more sinister explanation.					    BOWMAN					    Oh?					    POOLE					    Yes. You must have heard the					    rumour that went around during					    orbital check-out.					    BOWMAN					    No, as a matter of fact, I didn't.					    POOLE					    Oh, well, apparently there's					    something about the mission that					    the sleeping beauties know that					    we don't know, and that's why we					    were trained separately and					    that's why they were put to sleep					    before they were even taken aboard.12/14/65										 c15 C12CONTINUED					    BOWMAN					    Well, what is it?					    POOLE					    I don't know. All I heard is that					    there's something about the					    mission we weren't told.					    BOWMAN					    That seems very unlikely.					    POOLE 					    Yes, I thought so.					    BOWMAN					    Of course, it would be very easy					    for us to find out now.					    POOLE					    How?					    BOWMAN					    Just ask Hal. It's conceivable					    they might keep something from					    us, but they'd never keep anything					    from Hal.					    POOLE					    That's true.12/14/65										 c15a C12						   CONINUED					    BOWMAN					    (sighs)  Well... it's silly, but...					    if you want to, why don't you?POOLE WALKS TO THEHAL 9000 COMPUTER					    POOLE					    Hal... Dave and I believe that					    there's something about the					    mission that we weren't told.					    Something that the rest of the					    crew know and that you know.					    We'd like to know whether this					    is true.					    HAL					    I'm sorry, Frank, but I don't					    think I can answer that question					    without knowing everything that					    all of you know.					    BOWMAN					    He's got a point.					    POOLE					    Okay, then how do we re-phrase					    the question?12/14/65										 c15c	  C12 CONTINUED					    BOWMAN					    Still, you really don't believe it,					    do you?					    POOLE					    Not really. Though, it is strange					    when you think about it. It didn't					    really make any sense to keep					    us apart during training.					    BOWMAN					    Yes, but it's to fantastic to think					    that they'd keep something from us.					    POOLE					    I know. It would be almost					    inconceivable.					    BOWMAN					    But not completely inconceivable?					    POOLE					    I suppose it isn't logically impossible.					    BOWMAN					    I guess it isn't.					    POOLE					    Still, all we have to do is ask Hal.12/14/65										 c15b C12CONTINUED					    BOWMAN					    Well, the only important aspect of					    the mission are: where are we					    going, what will we do when we					    get there, when are we coming					    back, and... why are we going?					    POOLE					    Right. Hal, tell me whether the					    following statements are true or					    false.					    HAL					    I will if I can, Frank.					    POOLE					    Our Mission Profile calls for					    Discovery going to Saturn.					    True or false?					    HAL					    True.					    POOLE					    Our transit time is 257 days. Is					    that true?					    HAL					    That's true.12/14/65										 c15d C12CONTINUED					    POOLE					    At the end of a hundred days of					    exploration, we will all go into 					    hibernation. Is this true?					    HAL					    That's true.					    POOLE					    Approximately five years after we					    go into hibernation, the recovery					    vehicle will make rendezous with					    us and bring us back. Is this true?					    HAL					    That's true					    POOLE					    There is no other purpose for this					    mission than to carry out a					    continuation of the space program,					    and to further our general					    knowledge of the planets. Is that					    true?					    HAL					    That's true.

First of all,					    there is still a chance that he					    is right, despite your tests,					    and if it should happen again,					    we suggest eliminating this					    possibility by allowing the unit					    to remain in place and seeing					    whether or not it actually fails.					    If the computer should turn out					    to be wrong, the situation is					    still not alarming. The type					    of obsessional error he may be					    guilty of is not unknown among					    the latest generation of HAL					    9000 computers.					    It has almost always revolved					    around a single detail, such as					    the one you have described, and					    it has never interfered with the					    integrity or reliability of the					    computer's performance in					    other areas.

I think we may be on					    to an explanation of the trouble with					    the Hal 9000 computer.					    We believe it all started about two					    months ago when you and Frank					    interrogated the computer about					    the Mission.									 (con't)12/13/65										 c119C148CONTINUED					    SIMONSON (con't)					    You may have forgotten it, but					    we've been running through all					    the monitor tapes. Do you					    remember this?					    POOLE'S VOICE					    The purpose of this mission is no					    more than to carry out a					    continuation of the space program					    and further our general knowledge					    of the planets. Is this true?					    HAL'S VOICE					    That is true.					    SIMONSON					    Well, I'm afaid Hal was lying.					    He had been programmed to lie					    about this one subject for secur-					    ity reasons which we'll explain					    later.					    The true purpose of the Mission					    was to have been explained to you					    by Mission Commander Kaminsky,					    on his revival. Hal knew this and					    he knew the actual mission, but					    he couldn't tell you the truth when					    you challenged him. Under orders										    (con't)12/13/65										 c120 C148CONTINUED					    SIMONSON (con't)					    from earth he was forced to lie.					    In everything except this he had					    the usual reinforced truth program-					    ming.					    We believe his truth programming					    and the instructions to lie,					    gradually resulted in an					    incompatible conflict, and					    facedc with this dilemman, he					    developed, for want of a better					    description, neurotic symptoms.					    It's not difficult to suppose that					    these symptoms would centre on					    the communication link with					    Earth, for he may have blamed					    us for his incompatible program-					    ming.					    Following this lin of thought, we					    suspected that the last straw for him					    was the possibility of disconnection.					    Since he became operational, he had					    never known unconsciousness. It					    must have seemed the equivalent to					    death.										   (con't)12/13/65										 c121C148CONTINUED					    SIMONSON (con't)					    At this point, he, presumably,					    took whatever actions he thought					    appropriate to protect himself					    from what must have seemed to					    him to be his human tormentors.					    If I cane speak in human terms,					    I don't think we can blame him					    too much. We have ordered him					    to disobey his conscience.					    Well, that's it. It's very					    speculative, but we think it is					    a possible explanation. Anyway,					    good luck on the rest of the 					    Mission and I'm giving you back to					    Bernard.C149CUT TO MISSION CONTROL.					    MISSION CONTROL					    Hello, Dave.

I					    should like to fill you in on some					    more of the details on which					    Mission Commander Kaminsky					    will have already briefed you.					    Thirteen months before the launch					    date of your Saturn mission, on					    April 12th, 2001, the first evidence					    for intelligent life outside the Earth					    was discovered.					    It was found buried at a depth of					    fifteen metres in the crater Tycho.					    No news of this was ever announced,					    and the event had been kept					    secret since then, for reasons which					    I will later explain.					    Soon after it was uncovered, it					    emitted a powerful blast of										 (con't)12/13/65										 c124 C150CONTINUED					    FLOYD (con't)					    radiation in the radio spectrum					    which seems to have triggered					    by the Lunar sunrise.					    Luckily for those at the site, it					    proved harmless.					    Perhaps you can imagine our					    astonishment when we later found					    it was aimed precisely at Saturn.					    A lot of thought went into the					    question of wether or not it was					    sun-triggered, as it seemed					    illogical to deliberately bury a					    sun-powered device.					    Burying it could only shield it					    from the sun, since its intense					    magnetic field made it otherwise					    easily detectable.					    We finally concluded that the only					    reason you might bury a sun-					    powered device would be to keep					    it inactive until it would be					    uncovered, at which time it would					    absorb sunlight and trigger itself.											 (con't)12/14/65										 c125C150CONTINUED					    FLOYD					    What is its purpose?  I wish we					    knew. The object was buried on					    the moon about four million years					    ago, when our ancestors were					    primative man-apes.					    We've examined dozens of theories,					    but the one that has the most					    currency at the moment is that					    the object serves as an alarm.					    What the purpose of the alarm is,					    why they wish to have the alarm,					    whether the alarm represents					    any danger to us?  These are					    questions no one can answer.					    The intentions of an alien world,					    at least four million years older					    than we are, cannot be reliably					    predicted.					    In view of this, the intelligence					    and scientific communities felt					    that any public announcment					    might lead to significant cultural					    shock and disorientation.					    Discussion took place at the 					    highest levels between govern-										    (con't)12/14/65										 c126 C150CONTINUED					    FLOYD (con't)					    ments, and it was decided that the					    only wise and precautionary					    course to follow was to assume					    that the intentions of this alien					    world are potentially dangerous					    to us, until we have evidence to					    the contrary.					    This is, of course, why security					    has been maintained and why					    this information has been kept					    on a need-to-know basis.					    And now I should like to show you					    a TV monitor tape of the actual					    signalling event.12/14/65										 c127C151WE SEE A REPLAYOF THE TMA-1 RADIOEMISSION, AS SEENFROM A TV MONITORON THE SPOT.

But when they looked out across					    the deeps of space, they felt					    awe and wonder - and loneliness.					    In their explorations, they					    encountered life in many forms,					    and watched on a thousand worlds					    the workings of evolution.					    They saw how often the first faint					    sparks of intelligence flickered					    and died in the cosmic night.					    And because, in all the galaxy,					    they had found nothing more					    precious than Mind, they					    encouraged its dawning every-					    where.					    The great Dinosaurs had long					    since perished when their ships					    entered the solar system, after					    a voyage that had already lasted					    thousands of years.12/9/65										  d2D1CONTINUED						NARRATOR (con't)						They swept past the frozen outer						planets, paused briefly above the						deserts of dying Mars and						presently looked down on Earth.						For years they studied, collected						and catalogued.						When they had learned all they						could, they began to modify.						They tinkered with the destiny						of many species on land and in						the ocean, but which of their						experiments would succeed						they could not know for at least						a million years.						They were patient, but they were						not yet immortal. There was						much to do in this Universe of a						hundred billion stars. So they						set forth once more across the						abyss, knowing that they would						never come this way again.						Nor was there any need. Their						wonderful machines could be						trusted to do the rest.										  (con't)12/9/65										  d3 D1CONTINUED					    NARRATOR (con't)					    On Earth, the glaciers came and					    went, while above them, the					    changeless Moon still carried its					    secret.					    With a yet slower rhythm than					    the Polar ice, the tide of					    civilization ebbed and flowed					    across the galaxy.					    Strange and beautiful and terrible					    empires rose and fell, and passed					    on their knowledge to their					    successors.					    Earth was not forgotten, but it was					    one of a million silent worlds, a					    few of which would ever speak.					    Then the first explorers of Earth,					    recognising the limitations of					    their minds and bodies, passed					    on their knowledge to the great					    machines they had created, and					    who now trnscended them in					    every way.										  (con't)12/9/65										  d4D1CONTINUED					    NARRATOR					    For a few thousand years, they					    shared their Universe with their					    machine children; then, realizing					    that it was folly to linger when					    their task was done, they passed					    into history without regret.					    Not one of them ever looked through					    his own eyes upon the planet Earth					    again.					    But even the age of the Machine					    Entities passed swiftly. In their					    ceaseless experimenting, they					    had learned to store knowledge					    in the structure of space itself,					    and to preserve their thoughts					    for eternity in frozen lattices					    of light. They could become					    creatures of radiation, free					    at last from the tyranny of matter.					    Now, they were Lords of the					    galaxy, and beyond the reach					    of time.					    They could rove at will among the					    stars, and sink like a subtle mist					    through the very interstices of					    space.12/9/65										  d5 D1CONTINUED					    NARRATOR (con't)					    But despite their God-like powers,					    they still watched over the					    experiments their ancestors					    had started so many generations					    ago.					    The companion of Saturn knew					    nothing of this, as it orbited					    in its no man's land between Mimas					    and the outer edge of rings.					    It had only to remember and wait,					    and to look forever Sunward with					    its strange senses.					    For many weeks, it had watched					    the approaching ship. Its long-					    dead makers had prepared it for					    many things and this was one of					    them. And it recognised what					    was climbing starward from the					    Sun.					    If it had been alive, it would have					    felt excitement, but such an					    emotion was irrelevant to its					    great powers.										   (con't)12/9/65										  d6D1CONTINUED					    NARRATOR (con't)					    Even if the ship had passed it by,					    it would not have known the					    slightest trace of disappointment.					    It had waited four million years;					    it was prepared to wait for					    eternity.					    Presently, it felt the gentle touch					    of radiations, trying to probe its					    secrets.					    Now, the ship was in orbit and it					    began to speak, with prime					    numbers from one to eleven,					    over and over again.					    Soon, these gave way to more					    complex signals at many frequen-					    cies, ultra-violet, infra-red,					    X-rays.					    The machine made no reply. It					    had nothing to say.					    Then it saw the first robot					    probe, which descended and					    hovered above the chasm.									    (con't)12/9/65										  d7 D1CONTINUED					    NARRATOR (con't)					    Then, it dropped into darkness.					    The great machine knew that this					    tiny scout was reporting back to					    its parent; but it was too simple,					    too primative a device to detect					    the forces that were gathering					    round it now.					    Then the pod came, carrying					    life. The great machine searched					    its memories.					    The logic circuits made their					    decision when the pod had fallen					    beyond the last faint glow of the					    reflected Saturnian light.					    In a moment of time, too short to					    be measured, space turned and					    twisted upon itself.12/9/65										  d8					 END OF SCREENPLAY					   END OF FILE
