We do not hear the dialogue but DOYLE asksRUSSO what he wants BUDDY looks up and says "Cinzano." DOYLEturns and says "Two of these." DOYLE slips into the chairopposite RUSSO and the titles roll on. Unlike RUSSO who isconcentrating on the girls, DOYLE is digging the room andthe people who occupy the tables in it, as if he is the sortof man who cannot relax until he knows who is around him,why they are there. 7.INT. THE CLUB - NIGHTA long view from DOYLE's position of the room, a quickcertain survey that stumbles twice; on laughter that seemstoo raw and then over a flurry of activity by WAITERS andCAPTAINS serving a table on the main floor.
