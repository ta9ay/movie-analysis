I wasjust gonna go collect my retirementpension.The Cable Guy wears a clean white jump suit, and is extremely confident despite the fact that he speaks with a slight lisp. This lisp gives him a child-like quality.STEVENYou were supposed to be here four hoursago.CABLE GUYWas I? So I'm the tardy one. Good toknow.STEVENYes. I had to go to the Bed 'n Bathplace, but now it's closed.CABLE GUY(turns to leave)Maybe I shouldn't have come at all ñ jerkoff!(turns back smiling)I'm just joking.

The twins werestars of the hit sitcom "Double Trouble"which aired from nineteen seventy-seventill nineteen eighty-four.A video package rolls in - We see several photographs of Sam Sweet and his twin brother at various ages. Included is the cast photo of "Double Trouble." Pictured in the photo are eight-year-old Stan and Sam and Conrad Janis as their single dad.We see a brief clip from "Double Trouble," starring the two eight-year-old boys, then a shot of Sam Sweet being taken out of a police car in handcuffs.RIKKI KLIEMAN(to camera)Life wasn't so sweet after the cancellationof their program. Hollywood chewed themup and spit them out. A frustrated Samturned to petty larceny, while his moreimpressionable brother, Stan, fell inwith a fringe cult called "TheBrotherhood of Friends." Reduced totabloid fodder a fury was growing insideof Sam. A burning need to be recognizedas an individual, not a person famous forhaving an identical twin. A need thattook the form of four shotgun blasts onthe night of November fourteenth. And sotoday his attorneys continue the unusualdefense of "Twin Envy."ANGLE ONSteven re-enters the room. The Cable Guy is watching television.STEVENHow's it going?The Cable Guy holds up one finger as if to say "quiet." His eyes never leave the TV.CABLE GUYGuilty, guilty, guilt-freakin-tee. Ihope they fry this bastard.Steven sees that the Cable Guy has completely redecorated the room in a fashion which makes the room impractical for anything other than watching television. The TV is now on the stairs blocking the entrance into the living room. All furniture faces the TV, making conversation impossible.STEVEN(looks around)What happened?CABLE GUY(jumps to his feet)The arrangement of your major appliancesand your furniture was causing some noisypics and hum bars in your reception. Imoved a few things. Cleared it right up.Is that cool?STEVEN(non-confrontational)IÖ guess so.CABLE GUYYou programmed?(off of Steven's look)Then let me slave your remotes.He picks up Steven's remotes, punches in a complicated series of commands, then points them at each other. As he holds them together he makes a face as if their power is surging through him.CABLE GUYOoh, maybe we should leave these twoalone.STEVENSo after this I'll only need one remotefor everything?CABLE GUYYou know you're pretty good at this. Youcould be a cable guy yourself.(he finishes)Now let me check your levels.With amazing alacrity he adjusts color setting, sound controls, closed captioned, etc. Then he clicks through the channels. A music video, documentary on Hitler, Oprah Winfrey Show, starving kids, Barney, court TV. The Cable Guy watches emotionless.CABLE GUYAll right. That about does it. I justhave some paperwork for you to fill out.Sign here.Steven does.CABLE GUYThat gave me power of attorney over you.(beat)Joking.Steven laughs. The Cable Guy joins him, but then continues to laugh way too hard for way too long. As the laugh ends it quickly turns into an awkward moment. The Cable Guy does not want to leave.CABLE GUYI'm about finished here.(beat)Okay. I feel good about this.Cable Guy walks to the door.STEVENOne thing.CABLE GUY(turns back immediately)Yeah!STEVENIÖ uhÖ I have this friend and he saidhe gave his cable guy fifty bucks and hegot free movie channels. Have you everheard of anything like that?CABLE GUY(deadly serious)You mean illegal cable?STEVENUhÖ yes.CABLE GUYWho told you that? I want his name.STEVENForget it.CABLE GUYYou're offering me a bribe? What youhave just done is illegal, and in thisstate if convicted, you could be finedfive-thousand dollars or spend six monthsin a correctional facility.STEVENPleaseÖ that was dumb. I was justmaking conversation ñCABLE GUY(laughs)I'm just jerking your chain. Wake uplittle snoozy. I'll juice you up. Allit is is a push of a button.He puts his arm around Steven and walks him toward the front door.STEVENOh, great. How much?CABLE GUYDon't worry about it. I couldn't chargeyou. Your girl just booted you.Consider it one guy doing another guy asolid.STEVENThat is so nice.CABLE GUYHey, you're a 'nice' guy. You'd besurprised how many customers treat youlike shit, like I'm a god damn plumber orsomething.(hands him a card)Here is my personal beeper number. It'sjust for my preferred customers. Nevercall the company, they'll just put you onhold.STEVENThanks. Really.(holds up comment card - jokes)You're gonna get some good marks here.CABLE GUYMaybe some day I'll take you out to thesatellite and show you how all this stuffworks. It's really incredible.STEVENSure. We should do that one day.CABLE GUYHow 'bout tomorrow?STEVENTomorrow? Tomorrow's not good.CABLE GUYWhat are you going to do, sit home andstew about your ex?STEVENNo.CABLE GUY(insulted)Oh, okay. I guess I crossed the line.Sorry.STEVEN(guilty)You didn't cross the line.CABLE GUYNo? Cool. I'll pick you up at six-thirty.On the flip side.The Cable Guy leaves before Steven can reconsider. Steven cannot believe he just got roped into that.(End Revision - Pink)14	INT. CITYWIDE LAND DEVELOPERS - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAYSteven is in the middle of a presentation to his co-workers.

VAN - CONTINUOUSThe van drives onto the main boulevard.CABLE GUYThanks for coming out. You know mostpeople think cable is just a simple co-axthat comes out of the wall.

Coming up next, a rareinterview with Michael Jackson's zoo-keeper.25	INT. HIGH SCHOOL GYM - DAYSteven is playing a pick-up, full court basketball game with some of his friends. It is a competitive, but friendly game. Steven is on skins, Rick is on shirts.STEVENHere, here, here.A player passes to Steven. Rick is covering him. Steven drives to the basket and puts in a lay up.RICK(to himself)Shit! My fault! My fault!STEVENNot your fault. I'm in the zone. Thereis no stopping me today.Play begins again. A player named JEFF takes the ball out, then passes to a heavy-set player who catches the ball, then drives to the basket. When he does he twists his ankle, dropping the ball. The ball rolls out of bounds into a dark corner of the gym. We follow it as it rolls on the ground until it hits a man's sneaker. A pair of hands pick up the ball. The camera tilts up the man's body. It is the Cable Guy. He is holding another ball. He starts dribbling the two balls in a circular pattern.CABLE GUYHey, you guys play here, too? Cool. Iwas just in the neighborhood. Thought I'drun the court for a couple of innings.RICK(gestures to injured player)Great. We need another man.STEVENThis isÖ Chip DouglasÖ my cable guy.Rick smiles in recognition.CABLE GUYWe met about a week ago during a routineinstallation, but I feel like I've knownhim my whole life.Steven can't believe this is happening.RICKOh really. That's sweet. All right ChipDouglas, you're on shirts. Let's play.CABLE GUYNo, I want to be on Steven's team. I'mskins.The Cable Guy quickly takes off his shirt. Steven looks shocked because underneath his clothes he is rippled with muscles. The dichotomy between his nerdy face, and his awesome physique is scary.JEFFI don't care, I'll be shirts. Let's justplay.CABLE GUYWait a sec'. I've got to warm up.The Cable Guy starts running wind sprints across the court, touching all the main lines. Everyone stares at him until he finishes.CABLE GUYLet's get it on!STEVENAre you any good?CABLE GUYFeed me under the boards and you'll findout.Play begins. The shirts inbound to Jeff. The Cable Guy is all over him, covering him as tightly as humanly possible. He keeps his hands near Jeff's face, whacks him in the back as he dribbles, etc. He couldn't be more annoying. Jeff passes to Rick who drives to the basket and puts up a shot which goes in. Rick and Jeff slap hands.CABLE GUY(doing the traveling hand signal)Traveling! That's traveling!RICKYeah, whatever you say Chip.Everyone runs down the court, ignoring him.CABLE GUYAll right, so we're playing that type ofgame. Prison rules. I get it.Steven takes the ball out. The cable Guy runs around the court, attempting to get open. He criss crosses all over the court.CABLE GUYFeed me the rock! Feed me the rock! I'mopen!Steven passes to the Cable Guy, who drives to the basket, pushing Jeff out of the way in the process. The ball goes in.CABLE GUY(does the foul hand signal)And one! That's definitely a foul!(to Jeff)You want to mug me, my wallet is in myother pants.STEVEN(to Cable Guy)What are you doing?CABLE GUYDon't play from fear Steven. We can takethese guys.MUSIC UP - SLOW MOTION - STEVEN'S P.O.V.a. The shirts put a shot which doesn't go in. The Cable Guy swings his elbows wildly as he pulls it down.b. The Cable Guy drives to the basket in slow motion violently taking down two men, including Rick.c. Rick drives to the basket. On his way he fakes out Steven who falls to the floor. Rick scores. The Cable guy helps Steven up. As the Cable Guy walks across the court he bangs shoulders with Rick.d. The cable Guy passes the ball to Steven, then sets a nasty pick against Rick, who goes down hard.CABLE GUYTake it to the hole!Steven is so un-nerved by the Cable Guy's behavior that he misses a simple lay up. Steven grabs his own rebound. When he puts up a second shot, Rick gently fouls him. Steven stumbles to the ground. The ball does not go in.CABLE GUYHey, are you okay?He pulls Steven up.STEVENYeah. I'm fine.CABLE GUYLet's switch. I'll cover Rick.The cable Guy gets in Rick's face and gives him a death stare.Steven takes out the ball. He passes to a teammate who passes it to the Cable Guy who drives to the basket, then literally steps on Rick's back and leaps into the air and dunks the ball.RICK(enraged)What the hell was that? That's it. I'vehad enough.Everyone begins to exit the court.JEFFThanks for bringing your "friend".The Cable Guy runs up to Rick.CABLE GUYGood game.(slaps Rick on the butt)You were tough out there. Your playbrought me up to a higher level. I meanthat.RICK(dismissive)Yeah.He shakes his head and exits with the rest of the players.STEVENWhat are you doing?CABLE GUYIt was payback time.

I'vegot to go shower up and do some stuff.I'll call you if I get a chance. Or youcall meÖ or something.The Cable guy puts his hand up for Steven to high five. Steven slaps it halfheartedly. Then the cable guy extends his palm out low by his knee.CABLE GUYAnd down low.Steven stares at it for a beat. The cable Guy waits. He'll wait as long as it takes. Finally Steven gives him a low five just so he can leave.CABLE GUY(pulls his hand away so Steven misses it)Too slow. Have a good one.STEVEN(as he walks away)Yeah, have a good one.26	INT. STEVEN'S APARTMENT - NEXT NIGHTSteven runs in with a small bag of groceries. He is dressed for a date. He pulls out a bottle of wine. He opens the oven, and checks on dinner. It is almost ready.

Come now people,let me hear your voices!The crowd cheers. Music plays. The serfs hand them each a sword and shield, then walk them to the center of the pit.The Cable Guy crouches in a war-like position. He begins to circle Steven like a cat. Steven mirrors him, not sure of what to do.STEVENJust take it easy.The Cable Guy runs at Steven, and swings his sword. In fear, Steven puts his shield over his head. The sword smashes into it sending sparks into the air. The Cable Guy darts toward Steven and pokes him several times with his sword. Each time Steven blocks it with either his sword or his shield.STEVEN(enraged)What are you doing?!CABLE GUY(matter of fact)I'm trying to kill you.The Cable Guy grabs a mace (a stick with a chain and ball attached to it) off of a weapon filled wall and runs at Steven, swinging with abandon. Steven blocks the deadly mace with his shield.STEVENHey, watch it!The Cable Guy leaps onto Steven. Then he speaks into his ear as he pushes him down onto the ground.CABLE GUYThis is just like when Spock had to fightKirk on 'Star Trek.' Best friends forcedto do battle.Steven gets angry and pushes the Cable Guy off of him. He swings at the Cable Guy with his sword, just missing him. The Cable Guy rolls on the ground and pops back up in the air.CABLE GUYThat's the spirit. Let's give 'em a goodshow.Steven charges at the Cable Guy, swinging wildly. It is a real battle now. He bangs away at the Cable Guy's mace until he knocks it out of his hands. The Cable Guy runs backwards, then falls on the ground.By the look in his eyes we can tell that the Cable Guy's feelings are hurt.CABLE GUYSo that's how it's gonna be, huh? Allright. If you want to play rought, Daddycan play rough.The Cable Guy charges at Steven with his shield. He upper cuts the shield to Steven's face, sending him to the ground.The Cable Guy runs to the wall and grabs a huge battle ax, a four foot long stick with a fancy silver blade on the end of it. He swings it in circles like a Japanese master. Steven grabs a similar weapon, and then begin to circle each other.STEVENChip, this isn't funny! Will you stopit!CABLE GUYThe name is Spock. If we don't battle tothe death, they'll kill us both. Good-byeJim.He swings his sword, and they battle 'Star Trek' style. The Cable Guy begins to sing the "Star Trek Battle Music" as they fight.STEVENThis isn't 'Star Trek!'MUSIC UP: STAR TREK BATTLE MUSICThey bang the handles of their battle axes together, jockeying for position. The Cable Guy pushes Steven away from him, then takes a huge swing, but Steven leaps in the air over the blade. The Cable Guy swings over his head, and Steven blocks it with his ax handle. They continue to swing and roll in a vicious battle.Then the Cable Guy takes a swing which Steven is unable to block. The battle ax cuts through part of Steven's protection.STEVEN(looking down)Jesus.The Cable Guy runs to a horses' entrance. There is a long pause, and then we hear the sound of pounding horse hooves. A moment later the Cable Guy rides out on a horse holding a jousting stick.The show's host runs up to Steven.HOSTQuickly, muster a top your steed.(Steven doesn't move - the host drops character)Get on the god damn horse! I don't thinkhe's kidding!Left with no choice, Steven jumps on a horse and grabs a joust. The host smacks Steven's horse sending it straight toward the charging Cable Guy.STEVENDon't do this!CABLE GUYJim, we have no choice!STEVENOh my god.They run toward each other. A horrible game of chicken. Neither gives in. When they reach one another Steven knocks the Cable Guy off his horse with his jousting stick.The Cable Guy flies through the air, lands on his back. Steven rides to him. Jumps off his horse, throws off his helmet.STEVEN(concerned)Are you okay?The Cable Guy sits up and smile at him.CABLE GUYWell done good sir. You are the victor,but we shall meet again.The two serfs put Steven on a chair connected to two poles. They carry him to the center of the arena in victory. The crowd cheers wildly.
