------------------------------------------------------------FINDING NEMO Transcript v1.0Copyright 2003 Walt Disney Pictures, Pixar Animation Studios------------------------------------------------------------Transcribed by BaD_BURNemail : markgonzalez154@hotmail.com ------------------------------------------------------------------| Okay, this is the work-in-progress FINDING NEMO film transcript.  || Why is it 'work-in-progress' you might ask? Well for one, this    || isn't a 100% accurate transcript: some words might be missing,    || may not be right. Second, some lines may or may not have been     || spoken by the right character. There are instances in the film    || where a line is spoken but the character isn't on screen, which   || makes things complicated. But I'd say this transcript is about    || 98-99% accurate. Dialogue for each scene is seperated by a line   || of equal signs (=).                                               ||                                                                   || This transcript is open for corrections, additions if you have    || any. What you CAN'T do, however, is to edit it and take credit    || for it. Although I do not own the movie or it's screenplay, this || transcript was made with no intention of copyright infringement || and the like. Enjoy. And remember: 'Fish are friends, not food'. | ------------------------------------------------------------------======================================================================================MARLINWow.CORALMmm.MARLINWow.CORALMmm-hmm.MARLINWow.CORALYes, Marlin.
