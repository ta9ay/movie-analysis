We see the palace at night, blanketed in abeautiful, almost glowing, snow as hourse drawn carriagespull up to the front door.                       TATIANA (CONT)          A beautiful, magical time. . . MOVE INTO THE PALACE                       TATIANA (CONT)          That would soon be gone          forever. . . INT.  PALACE AT ST. PETERSBERG - NIGHTElegant ROYALISTS mingle around the MAIN HALL as anORCHESTRA plays.All eyes turn to the GLASS DOORS OF TWO ELEVADORS whichdescend grandly on either side of a beautiful staircase.Through the glass doors we see TATIANA, the DowagerEmpress, 60, imperious and bedecked with jewels, she isseemingly unapproachable. TSAR NICHOLAS and his SON arewith her. In the other elevador, ALEXANDRA and herdaughters - well,  all her daughters except. . . ANASTASIA, eight years old and apparently late for theparty, rushes down the upstairs hallway followed by aSERVENT (SONYA) 16,  who is trying to catch up withAnastasia to tie a large ribbon in her long, dark hair.                       SONYA                  (whispering)          Princess Anastasia - you're          late and it's all my  fault!                       ANASTASIA          Don't worry, Sonya, no one'll          notice. . . Just then, Sonya lassoes the ribbon around her hair,stopping Anastasia with a                        ANASTASIA                  (loudly)          . . .  owwwwwwwww!All eyes turn to Anastasia, who once she realizes thatshe's the center of attention, flashes a mischievoussmile and descends the staircase in grand style. As theribbon falls out of her hair and down her back,Anastasia kicks it to Sonya without breaking stride.Tatiana sees her and can't help but smile.The music suddenly becomes  a FLOURISH OF TRUMPETS.SERVENTS open the elevador doors as the ROYAL FAMILYsteps out and begins a proccession through theirsubjects. Tatiana holds out her arm to Anastasia as shemakes it to Tatiana's side just in time. Anastasia hasa beautiful but slightly impish face, dominated bylarge, blue, mischievous eyes. She an abundance of energy and confidence for a girl her age.<u>"THE RULARS OF RUSSIA"  (OPENING NUMBER)   The elegant guests sing their admiration as thebeautiful and happy Romanov family makes it's entranceinto the ball, they're "the  pride of all Russia".Vladimir invites Sophie to dance and the entireglittering assembly assembly swings into a GLORIOUS SWEEPING WALTZ. Singing their certainty that the Romanovs willrule forever.</u>During the above, the ball is in full swing. BeautifulCOUPLES swirls across the dance floor, includingAnastasia dancing gracefully with her father.Under a long buffet table, we see DMITRI, 11, darklyhandsome, dressed in ragged servant clothes, with ashock of dark hair which continuoually falls accross hiseyes as watches the guest enviously. Anastasia, stillwaltzing with her father, sees him. SERVENTS cross theroom carrying a trays of BEAUTIFUL TROPICAL FRUIT. Theguests "Ew" and "ah" at the sumptuous fruit. Anastasiasees Dmitri eyeing it hungrily and without missing adance step, she grabs an orange off thr tray and tossesit to Dmitri. He catches it and smiles broadly at her.Suddenly, A HAND grabs Dmitri and pulls him out fromunder the table. It's IVAR, the HEAD SERVENT, who pullsDmitri into an open wall panel.                       IVAR                  (angrily)          You're a servent! Never forget          your place!                       DMITIRI                  (defiant)          Someday my place will be out          there!                       IVAR          Never! You're a peasant,          Dmitri! Back in the kitchen<u>RULARS OF RUSSIA (CONT.)   UNDERSCORE CONTINUES as Dmitri is dragged from hishiding place under the table and back to the kitchen.It's like the Moscow circus back there, COMIC MUSICALCONFUSION. The servants sing about their demandingemployers and mockingly imitate their behavior:  theyimply that they have their own "party",  that change iscoming.   While back in the ballroom, the Royalists areoblivious to the servants discontent and sing theirsatisfaction with their own lives.   DRAMATIC UNDERSCORE CONTINUES though the followingscenes.</u>ON TATIANAin a large throne-like chair. Tatiana is very seriousand very regal. She slides over to make room forAnastasia who sits next to her.                       TATIANA          Why were you so late tonight                        ANASTASIA          I was showing Sonya          something . . .                       TATIANA          What were you showing her?                       ANASTASIA                  (sheepishly)          How to read.                       TATIANA          I thought you were told not to          tutor your servants anymore.                       ANASTASIA          I know, but I had to because . . .Anastasia looks up at Tatiana and sees her smile withpride.  Anastasia knows she doesn't have to explain.                       ANASTASIA                  (cuddling)          Oh, Grandmama, why do you have          to go back to Paris?                       TATIANA          It's where I've made my home          but I do have something for          you . . .Tatiana reaches from behind the chair and brings out abeautiful MUSIC BOX.  Tatiana takes the key, a smallsilver and enamel flower, on a silver neck chain andwinds it up. MUSIC BEGINS, she hands Anastasia the key.CLOSE UPthe key bearing the inscription "Together in Paris".                       ANASTASIA          "Together in Paris"! Oh, when          can we be "together in Paris?!                       TATIANA          When you're older . . .Anastasia makes a disgruntled face. Tatiana laughs.                       TATIANA          Until then, whenever you hear          this song, think of me and know          that I'm waiting for you.Tatiana puts the key around Anastasia's neck and theyembrace. Then, suddenly . . .ON THE GRAND CHANDELIERthe lights begin to fade in and out.GROUP SHOTas PEOPLE in the ballroom look around bewildered. Then,a WHIRLWIND kicks up, sending everyone off the dancefloor, as the whirlwind becomes a TORNADO.Suddenly, an ALBINO BAT (BARTOK) with huge eyes, springsout of the funnel, screeching and swooping over thecrowd, causing everyone to duck and cover their heads infear.The tornada reaches it's peak and EXPLODES in smoke -leaving RASPUTIN standing alone in the middle of thefloor. He is of indeterminate age, towering over othermen in the room, his most striking feature are his eyes- which at this moment are burning a fiery red. He isdressed in a flowing black monk's robe with a satin ropetied around his waist. Connected to the rope is aglowing RELIQUARY, a mystical lantern.VARIOUS SHOTSof Nicholas, Alexandra, Sophie and Vladimir, Dmitripeeking out ofthe wallpanel, Tatiana and Anastasia,all of whom are frightened.NICHOLASas he gathers his son and wife to his side                       NICHOLAS          Rasputin!

NICHOLAS          I did no such thing!                       RASPUTIN          After all I've done for your          family - YOU TRIED TO KILL          MEEEEEE ! ! !Rasputin swings the reliquary, wrapping himself in smokewhich seems to grow larger. Eerie moaning noises comefrom the reliquary. PEOPLE back awayin terror.                       RASPUTIN (CONT.)          The Romanov dynasty ends here!          You, your wife and children          will all die within the          fortnight!                       ANASTASIA          NO!Anastasia leaves Tatiana and rushes to stand in front ofher father. Still holding her Music Box, Anastasia'sshaking hands are the only thing that gives away her fear. Rasputin spins toward the voice.                       ANASTASIA          We're not afraid of you!                       RASPUTIN                  (furious)          You . . .  my little babushka . . .          you'll be so much fun to kill           that I'll save you for last!Twirling the reliquary again, the MOANS grow louder asBartok circles around his head. The smoke that emergesseems to have almosy a human shape to it.                       RASPUTIN          THIS IS THE END OF THE ROMANOV          LINE - FOREVER !!!!The tornada of smoke begins again, whipping into afrenzy and then EXPLODING.The smoke clears and Rasputin is gone. As the lightsreturn to normal the Romanov family all stand together,and try to look regal and in control once again.                       TATIANA (O.C.)          Some say Rasputin ad harnessed          all the dark powers of evil and           that it was his curse which           brought about the end . . .

And there will be no blood on my hands ...Rasputin backs away as the cherubs aim their JAGGED ARROWSat Anya.Suddenly, Meetoo leaps up from the bed, barking. Rasputin,startled, jumps backward. Bartok falls off his shoulder andon to the table, knocking into the reliquary - which is aboutto fall.                        RASPUTIN (CONT.)          Nooooooo!Rasputin catches it.
