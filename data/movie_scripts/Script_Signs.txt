I have some preliminary thoughts.Morgan sits with his monitor next to Bo, who quietly watchesthe TV. Merrill and Graham squeeze in next to Morgan. OFFICER PASKI There are three possibilities here. We'll call them one, two and three. The level one scenario is that there is a sane individual, who for real reasons wants to do you harm. I really don't believe that's what we're looking at here. In my opinion, whoever this is, they don't want to do harm to you all. That's kind of clear. (beat) The level two scenario is, this is a mentally unstable person who's fixated on you and your family. This is a possibility, but a very slim one. (beat) I assure you I will treat all three possibilities carefully, but in all likely hood we are looking at what we'll call a level three scenario. He's a watcher. Someone who this is a game for. He's laying low. Doesn't want to be seen. But he wants to watch you. Study you folks.Officer Paski walks towards the windows.

OFFICER PASKI Now I don't want you all to worry about this no more. You're making more of this than it is. (beat) You guys have had a tough couple of days with the vandalism to the crops and the death of your shepherd. (beat) Maybe you guys should do something fun? Let me worry about this person. Let me find out who it is and then -- What the hell are you people looking at?Edgar comes around to see the screen.WE ARE ON A TV SCREEN.

It is the eighteenth reported crop circle found in that country in the last seventy-two hours.The television report cuts to Columbia University PROFESSOR. PROFESSOR (TV) Crop circles first emerged in the late seventies with the renewed interest in extraterrestrial life. They died out by the early eighties; dismissed as hoaxes. This new resurgence is wholly different. Elements of it are unexplainable. The speed and the quantity in which it has appeared implies the coordination of hundreds of individuals over many countries... (beat) There is only a limited amount of explanations. Either this is one of the most elaborate hoaxes ever created, or basically... (beat) It's for real.Morgan takes the asthma inhaler from his pocket and breathesin deeply.

OFFICER PASKI But I'll tell you something, what I said in their, still goes. You and your family have been through a lot in the last two days... Not to mention what happened to you all seven months ago. GRAHAM Six months.Edgar stares at Graham. GRAHAM And three weeks. OFFICER PASKI It's left its mark still. The last thing these children need to do, is worry about some crazy things happening in the world. Take them into town. Get their minds -- your mind, on everyday things. It's good medicine. GRAHAM It's good advice... (beat) Say hi to Marcia for me. OFFICER PASKI You take care of yourself... (beat) Graham. CUT TO:EXT. STATION WAGON - AFTERNOONWE MOVE THROUGH BACK ROADS OF BUCKS COUNTY.

ARMY RECRUITING OFFICE - AFTERNOONMerrill stares up at a poster with a muscular guy in an Armyuniform standing at attention on a beach.We are in a narrow ARMY RECRUITING CENTER. Inside the smallstorefront space is a desk. A gentleman sporting a CREWCUTsits behind it.A young man, Merrill's age, sits at a side card table fillingout some forms. CREWCUT GUY I got it figured.Merrill realizes the crewcut guy is talking to him. MERRILL You do? CREWCUT GUY I've had two separate folks tell me they think there are strangers around these parts the last couple of nights. Can't tell what they look like, cause they're staying in the shadows -- covert like. No one's got hurt mind you... And that's the give away. MERRILL (doesn't see) I see. CREWCUT GUY It's called probing. It's a military procedure. You send a reconnaissance group, very small, to check out things. Not to engage, but to evaluate the situation. Evaluate the level of danger. Make sure things are all clear... MERRILL Clear for what?The crewcut guy savors the beat of silence. CREWCUT GUY ... For the rest of them.It takes a second, but Merrill smiles. The crewcut guysmiles back. Merrill points at a poster. MERRILL You have a pamphlet or something I can read?The crewcut guy reaches to a stack of brochures. Picks thetop brochure and hands it to Merrill.The crewcut guy begins to stare at Merrill closely. CREWCUT GUY Hey you didn't used to play baseball did you?Merrill looks up from the brochure. Beat. CREWCUT GUY Shit. I know you. You're Merrill Hess. I was there that day you hit that five hundred and eighty seven footer over the left field wall and set the record. That thing had a motor on it... It's still the record right?Merrill not, "yes." MERRILL (soft) I got the bat at home... On the wall. CREWCUT GUY You got two minor league home run records don't you?Beat. MERRILL Five. The five longest. CREWCUT GUY Boy, why aren't you in the pros making stacks of cash and getting handfuls of T and A? YOUNG MAN (O.S.) Cause he also has the minor league strike out record.Merrill turns to the young man, about his age, who sits atthe folding table. MERRILL Hello Lionel.LIONEL smirks. LIONEL He'd just swing as hard as he could every time. It didn't matter what the coach said, didn't matter who was on base, he'd whip that bat through the air as hard as he could... Looked like a lumber jack chopping down a tree. (beat) Merrill here, struck out more times than any two players.Beat. CREWCUT GUY You really hold the strike out record?Beat. Merrill tucks the pamphlet in his jacket. Looks likehe's not going to say anything. When he does, the words aresoft and worn; they've been said a hundred times. MERRILL Felt wrong not to swing.Beat. The crewcut guy shakes his head. Merrill turns andstarts walking.As he passes Lionel, Merrill makes a small, quick move inLionel's direction, like he might hit him. Lionel flinchesand covers his face.Merrill walks out the door of the army recruiting office. CUT TO:INT. PHARMACY - AFTERNOON PHARMACIST I cursed thirty-seven times last week... I said the f-word a couple times, but mostly "shits" and "bastards." (beat) Is "Douche bag" a curse?Graham glances at the girl as she sits sideways to him at thecounter. GRAHAM I suppose it's in its usage. PHARMACIST How about "John you're a douche bag for kissing Barbara?" GRAHAM That's a curse. PHARMACIST Then it's not thirty-seven. It's seventy-one.Graham's eyes widen. PHARMACIST I stole a bottle of Ruby red lip stick from K-mart... I punched my brother in the back three times...Graham looks around the empty store for help.

WE TURN TO LOOK BACK AT THEHOUSE. Graham steps out the back screen door with a bowl ofdog food and a bowl of water.We watch him as he walks towards the frantic dog. When hegets close, Graham slows. He approaches the dog carefully. He places the two bowls close but not too close. The dog hasno interest in them.

CUT TO:EXT. BARN - EVENINGGraham stands frozen looking across his yard. Isabelle, thedog turns in desperate circles behind him. Graham's eyesstay focused on the same point in the darkness.

THEY AREARRANGED IN TWO "V'S" SIDE BY SIDE.Bo puts her finger to the screen and counts the hoveringlights. BO Fourteen.Morgan, Merrill and Graham stand silently before thetelevision set. TV ANCHOR Mexico City officials as well as U.S. officials have confirmed that these are not air crafts from either government's airforce.

BO My ballet recital.Morgan stares at his sister. MORGAN (gravely serious) Listen Bo. This is very important. Everything people have written about in science books is going to change.

MORGAN Dad!Graham doesn't take his eyes off the screen. GRAHAM (preoccupied) Find another tape.Graham and Merrill sit down at the same time on the sofa.

MERRILL (whispers) Some people are probably thinking this is the end of the world.Graham turns his sleepy eyes away from the screen to Merrill. GRAHAM (whispers) That's true.Merrill looks his brother in the eyes. Beat. MERRILL (whispers) Do you think it's a possibility? GRAHAM (whispers) Yes. MERRILL (whispers) How can you say that? GRAHAM (whispers) That wasn't the answer you wanted? MERRILL (whispers) Can you at least pretend to be like you used to be? Give me some comfort?Beat. Graham thinks it over. GRAHAM (whispers) ... There are all different ways you can tell that there's someone really there watching out for us. You see signs. Sometimes they're little ones. You think of someone. The phone rings. They're on the phone... Sometimes they're big, like fourteen lights hovering over Mexico City. (beat) Sure, there are a lot of people watching this who think this could be a bad thing. But there are a lot of people watching this, who think it's a miracle. A sign of God's existence. It's all in how you look at things Merrill. (beat) What you have to decide is what kind of person you are? Are you the type who believes in miracles and looks for signs or are you the kind who believes, things just happen by chance?Beat. Merrill is deep in thought. MERRILL I was at this party once. I'm on a couch with Sara Mckinney. She was just sitting there, looking beautiful and staring at me. I go to lean in and kiss her and I realize I have gum in my mouth. I turn and take out the gum. Stuff it in my paper cup next to the sofa and turn around. Sara Mckinney throws up all over herself. (beat) I knew the second it happened. It was a miracle. I could have been kissing her when she threw up. That would have scarred me for life. I may never have recovered.Merrill looks at the TV screen. Beat. MERRILL I'm a miracle man. Those lights are a miracle.Graham smiles. GRAHAM (whispers) There you go.Beat. MERRILL (whispers) So which type are you?Beat. GRAHAM (whispers) Do you feel comforted? MERRILL (whispers) Yes. GRAHAM (whispers) What does it matter then?The two of them turn back to the silent screen of thetelevision. It's a long beat before Graham speaks. GRAHAM (whispers) Do you know what Colleen's last words were before they killed her?Beat. Merrill turns and stares quietly at his brother. GRAHAM (whispers) She said, "See", and then her eyes glazed a bit and she said... "Tell Merrill to swing away."Merrill's mouth opens a bit. Graham turns and chuckles athis expression. GRAHAM (whispers) Do you know why she said that?Merrill nods, "No." GRAHAM (whispers) Because the nerve endings in her brain were firing as she died, and some random memory of us at one of your baseball games popped into her head. (beat) There is no one watching out for us Merrill. We're all on our own.Graham turns back to the television. Beat.THE LIGHT OF THE TELEVISION FLICKERS ON THE FACES OF THE TWOBROTHERS AS THEY SIT WATCHING IN SILENCE. CUT TO:INT. FAMILY ROOM - DAYGraham's eyes open. DAYLIGHT FILLS the family room. He isalone on the couch. Alone in the room.He looks to the television. It's not there.Graham moves to his feet and look around the room. His eyesstop on an EXTENSION CORD that runs from a wall outlet in thefamily room, across the front hall, and under a closet door.Graham moves to the door. WE HEAR MUFFLED TELEVISION VOICES. Graham opens theCLOSET.Merrill looks up. He's seated on a kitchen chair with thetelevision on a roll-away stand crammed in with him. MERRILL For the kids protection. All they were doing was watching TV from five a.m. I felt like they were getting obsessed like you said. They should be playing furry, furry rabbit or tea party or something right? GRAHAM What's furry, furry rabbit? MERRILL (points) That's a game isn't it? (beat) Anyway... (points at the TV) There's been some interesting developments. GRAHAM What time is it? MERRILL Eleven a.m. They're gone.Beat. Graham looks at the TV screen. There's a daylightshot of Mexico City. The skies are empty above it. MERRILL But they're not really gone. We just can't see them. Early this morning a bird flew right at the area where the lights were hovering last night.Merrill puts a finger in the sky on the screen. MERRILL It stopped dead in the air and fell straight down.Merrill's finger trails to the bottom of the screen. MERRILL They caught it on tape and they've been playing it all morning. They found the bird. His head crushed in. When you see the footage it looks like the bird flew into a wall in the sky. (beat) They think they have some invisible shield thing going, like an optical illusion. GRAHAM The bird could have had a heart attack and crushed his head when he fell. MERRILL Already thought of. Two other birds did the same thing an hour later. Not as dramatic. They lived. But you could see they hit something.Graham looks at the empty sky on the screen with differenteyes. MERRILL They're still there hovering. In fact, some people think there's more of them now. All over the place. Over us even. (beat) And there's a theory about the crop circles now. They think it could be some kind of landmark, visual mapping system -- so they can navigate. Coordinate. Makes sense doesn't it? CUT TO:INT.

He takes a seat between them. Morgan puts the bookon his father's lap. MORGAN It says they're probably very small -- like my height -- because, as their brains developed, there was no use for physical development.

Ray doesn't look over when he speaks. RAY I wrote your number down to call you. It's been sitting next to the phone for six months. When I knew it was inside the house, I couldn't think of any other number to call. I panicked. (beat) Thank you for coming Father. GRAHAM (soft) You're welcome Ray.Tears start falling down Ray's face. RAY I worked so long that night. I ain't never fallen asleep driving before. And never since. Most of the ride home, there wasn't a car insight in either direction. If I'd fallen asleep then, I'd a ended up in a ditch with a head ache. It had to happen at that right moment. That certain ten-fifteen seconds when I passed her walking. It was like it was meant to be.Ray finally turns. His red face quivers as he talks. RAY I guess if this is the end of the world, I'm screwed right? People who kill Reverends' wives aren't exactly ushered to the front of the line in heaven.Ray starts the car. GRAHAM Where you going Ray? RAY To the lake. The way I see it, all the places marked in the crops and such -- none of them are really near water. I figure they don't like water. (beat) Can't be any worse than here.Beat. GRAHAM Ray, did you see one of them?Ray looks at Graham. RAY I'm truly sorry for what I've done to you and yours.The two men stare at each other for a beat.

In that book of your, did they happen to detail what would happen if they were hostile? MORGAN Yes. They would invade us using only ground tactics. Hand to hand combat. They wouldn't use their technology or fight an airborne battle, because they would know we would eventually use nuclear weapons and the planet would be useless to them. MERRILL I'm sorry, what book is this? GRAHAM Did they say what our chances would be if they did invade? MORGAN They said one of two things could happen. One, they fight and are defeated and leave to return again with full forces hundreds or even thousands of years later. GRAHAM What's two? MORGAN They win.The words hang in the air. Graham sits quietly on the secondstep of the stairs. GRAHAM What do you think about the idea that they don't like places near water, and we might be safe from them near a lake or something? MORGAN Sounds made up.Beat. GRAHAM We can choose to believe it and pack up and leave. (beat) Or we can stay here. Board up this house. Hide inside our home and wait it out.

She is not barking. She sits staring right atus. She is shivering.OUR VIEW MOVES to the garage building where we see Merrillcarry a huge pile of his clothes and things down the stairs. He's moving into the main house.Merrill walks across the yard. His eyes look aroundcarefully as he moves.Part of the pile in his arms falls to the grass as he crossesthe lawn. He stops walking and starts to gather up thefallen things. He picks up a couple shirts and two baseballsencased in glass cases.The glass encasing one of the souvenir baseballs, hascracked. He takes the ball out. Stares at it.We watch from the crops as Merrill puts down his pile ofclothes and things on the grass. He looks around and findswhat he's looking for. A rake.Merrill unscrews the fork on the rake from the wooden handle. With the wooden stick in one hand and the souvenir baseballin the other, he turns to face the crops.WE PULL BACK A LITTLE INTO THE CROPS. PART OF OUR VIEW ISOBSCURED BY STALKS, BUT WE STILL SEE MERRILL CLEARLY.Merrill looks around cautiously again, before getting into abatter's stance. His left leg digs into the grass in frontof him. His weight is mostly on his back leg. He looks outinto the distance high over the crops. He throws thebaseball up in the air...Merrill grabs the wooden handle. Merrill's shoulders movewith blinding speed. The wooden rake handle slices the air. And misses the ball.The ball drops at Merrill's feet.WE WATCH as Merrill picks up the ball and tries again. Thistime his shoulders move even faster. The wooden stickactually makes A RESONANT SOUND as it cuts the air.The ball drops at Merrill's feet.WE WATCH THROUGH THE CROPS as Merrill snatches the ball upand tries a third time. This time he YELLS as he swings. Herips the air with the wooden stick so fast it blurs to theeye.The baseball drops at his feet. Strike three.Merrill stands still in the yard. He's breathing a littleheavy as he stares down at the ball.He gently picks it up. He walks back to his pile of thingsand then suddenly turns. He throws the ball in the air as hedoes. His left leg goes out. His weight goes to his rightleg as he turns his shoulders with astonishing speed andpower...THE SOUND OF THE BASEBALL HITTING THE WOODEN HANDLE CRACKSACROSS THE WHOLE YARD.The ball rockets into the air. We watch it fly overhead...sail high over the crops... it becomes a tiny dot in the sky.After a long beat of silence it comes back to earth. Itlands in the street and bounces twenty feet into the air. Itcleared at least four or five hundred feet of crops. Maybemore.WE LOOK BACK to Merrill standing in the backyard. He dropsthe wooden stick to the grass and moves for his things. Hepiles them in his arms. When his arms are full, he startsfor the porch. WE WATCH FROM THE CROPS AS MERRILL GOESINSIDE THE HOUSE.

He looksback at the empty closet doorway where Graham stood. Heturns back to the children. MERRILL You know about signs Morgan? Not like the ones people write on. It's like if you poured a glass of milk and you dropped the glass by mistake and broke it before you could drink it. Then you looked at the milk carton and saw that the milk was spoiled. They're things that happen by chance or luck, but make you feel that someone's watching out for you.The children think it over. Beat. MORGAN I once had a bad dream and I couldn't wake up. I kicked at the table next to my bed and something fell on me and I woke up. It was a picture of mom. She was smiling. It made me feel safe... You mean like that?Beat. MERRILL Yeah, like that.
