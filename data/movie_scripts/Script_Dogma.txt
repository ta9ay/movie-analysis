DOGMAEXT ASBURY PARK BOARDWALK - DAYJersey spring day. Beyond the wooden planks that make up the aged fun pier,the ocean waves crash into the sandy shoreline.An OLD MAN stares at the empty beach. Sun-worshipers hours away frombesmirching the dunes. His features are simple. He wears an old overcoat.His face belies good years gone by - a face that has seen more sunrisesthan one would suspect. He inhales the crisp, salty air and lets a small,satisfied smile cross his face.Behind him. a large arcade with steel shuttered doors sits on theboardwalk. Three young boys skate around by on roller blades, passing astreet hockey ball between them proficiently. The Old Man views thembriefly. checks his watch, and looks back toward the ocean.The skates of the three hockey playing youths skid to a halt. We pan up totheir faces - now cold and dispassionate. They look at one another and nod.Their skates glide out of frame.P.O.V. SKATERS - The Old Man leans on the railing that overlooks the beach.We get closer and closer to him until...One of the skaters checks him hard into the railing. The Old Man exhalesviolently and falls to his knees. The two other skaters begin savagelybeating on him with their hockey sticks, as he crumbles beneath them.Repeatedly their blades crash down hard on his head.OC VOICEI don't understand - how can you base your lack of belief in God on thewritings Lewis Caroll?The three skaters cease their beating and check the Old Man's pulse.Satisfied, they skate away, leaving his crumpled form on the boardwalk.INT AIRPORT - DAYLOKI walks beside a NUN in a semi-busy terminal. They pass through themetal detectors. The Nun carries a donation can.LOKILeaving 'Alice in Wonderland' aside, look closely at 'Through the LookingGlass' - particularly 'The Walrus and the Carpenter' poem: what's themetaphorical meaning?NUNI wasn't aware there was one.                                   LOKIOh, but there is - it colorfully details the sham that is organizedreligion. The Walrus - with his girth and good-nature - obviously refers toeither the Buddha, or - with his tusks - the lovable Hindu elephant god,Lord Ganesha. This takes care of the Eastern religions. The Carpenter is anobvious reference to Jesus Christ, who was purportedly raised the son of acarpenter. He represents the Western religions. And in the poem. what dothey do? They dupe all the oysters into followmg them. Then. when theoysters collective guard is down. the Walrus and the Carpenter shuck anddevour the helpless creatures, en masse. I don't know what that says toyou, but to me it says that following faiths based on these mythologicalfigures insures the destruction of one's inner-being.BARTLEBY sits amongst a row of seats by one of the arrival gates. He eatspopcorn and stares at...A steady stream of TRAVELERS, exiting the gate, meeting lovedones, family.                                  OC LOKIOrganized religion destroys who we are or who we can be by inhibiting ouractions and decisions out of fear of an intangible parent-figure who shakesa finger at us from thousands of years ago and says "No, no!"Bartleby smiles at the meet-and-greets, warmed. Loki saddles up beside him,kneeling on one of the seats, facing the Nun.                                   LOKI'Through the Looking Glass' - a children's tale? I think not.                                    NUN(really dazed)I've... I've never really thought about it like that...(beat; shocked; off her cassock)What have I been doing with my life...?'.                                   LOKIDon't look back. Just get out there and taste life.(off donation can)Leave this for the unenlightened. Poverty is for the gullible - it'sanother way the church is trying to control you. You take that money you'vebeen collecting for your parish reconstruction and go get yourself a nicepiece of ass. You deserve it.The Nun nods at him, and saunters off, obviously grappling with something.A passerby tries to stick money in her can, but she yanks it away. Lokifaces the proper direction in his seat and plops down beside thestill-transfixed Bartleby.                                 BARTLEBY                               (looking OC)Here's what I don't get about you: you know for a fact that there is a God.You've been in his presence, he's talked to you personally. And yet I justheard you claim to be an atheist.                                   LOKIC'mon man - you know I don't believe any of that shit I was telling her. Ijust like to fuck with the clergy; keep 'em on their toes. When her headstops spinning, she'll be facing the way of the Just again. But oh. willshe have a bunch to confess.(looks around)Now here's what I don't get about you: why do you feel the need to comehere all the time?                                 BARTLEBY(off travelers)I like to watch. This is humanity at it's best. Look at them.A reunited FAMILY share a group hug and move on, making way for two youngLOVERS to embrace and kiss passionately.                                OC BARTLEBYAll that tension, all that anger and mistrust, forgotten for one perfectmoment when they come off that plane. See those two? The guy doesn't evenknow that the girl cheated on him while he was away.OC LOKIShe did?Bartleby and Loki continue to watch the arrivals.                                 BARTLEBYUh-huh. Twice. But it doesn't matter at this moment because they're both sorelieved to be with one another. I like that. I just wish they could allfeel that way more offen.                                   LOKIMaybe if someone gave them free bags of peanuts more often they would. Nowwhat was so friggin' important that I had to miss cartoons this morning? Ifit was to share in your half-assed obsessions with Hallmark moments, I'mgoing to slug you.                                 BARTLEBY(still looking OC)You're never going to believe this: we're going home.                                   LOKI(off Bartleby's popcorn)Let me have some?                                 BARTLEBY(pulls out envelope)Look what somebody sent us in the mail.(hands him a newspaper article and corn)                                   LOKIDid you say we're going home?(reads)"Cardinal Glick Cuts Ribbon on 'Catholicism - Wow!"Campaign."(to Bartleby)And?BARTLEBYKeep reading.                                   LOKI(reads)"Updating the church... television spots... Papal consent...rededication...(to Bartleby)Again - and?                                 BARTLEBY(snatches article) Give me this(getting up; reading)"The Re-dedication of Saint Michael's Church on it's hundredth anniversaryis the kickoff of a new campaign that seeks to bring the Catholic Churchback into the mainstream. With a papal sanction, the archway entrance tothe centuryold, Jersey shore house of worship will serve as a passageway ofpleanry indulgence, which - according to Catholic beliefs - offers all whopass through it's arches a morally clean slate."(looks at Loki)You still don't get it, do you?                                   LOKINo, I don't get it. Are we leaving now?They start walking.                                 BARTLEBYIf you walk through the church's front door on the day of the Re-dedicationceremony, your soul is wiped clean of any and all existing sin, moreso thanthe sacrament of penance could ever offer. It's a plenary indulgence, man!I don't know why I never thought of this before.                                   LOKI(spits out chewed popcorn into trash can)Sounds thin. Sounds like someone made it up.                                 BARTLEBYIt's rarely employed, but it's legitimate. It has a papal sanction forGod's sake.                                   LOKISo you're saying you and I can walk through this doorway and go back home?                                 BARTLEBYNo - by passing through the doors, our sins areforgiven. Then all we have to do is die...                                   LOKIWait. wait, wait - Die? I don't want to die.(chews popcorn)                                 BARTLEBY(steps on conveyor belt)You'd rather stay down here for a few more eons?                                   LOKINo, but we don't even know if we can die. And what if we can, but thisarchway thing doesn't pan out? What then? Hell? Fuck that.(spits out chewed popcorn into napkin)                                 BARTLEBYImpossible. If we cut off our wings and transubstantiate to complete humanform then we become mortal. And if we die with clean souls, there's no wayto keep us out. They have to let us in.LOKI(beat)Who sent this thing?                                 BARTLEBYI don't know. Somebody who's looking out for us,I guess. Does it matter? All that matters is thatafter all these years, we've found a loophole. Hecan't keep us out anymore. And once we're backin, I'm sure He'll just forgive and forget.They pass the Nun. who leans against a wall, still dazed.                                   LOKIYeah, but this plenary' indulgence thing is a church law, not DivineMandate. Church laws are fallible because they're created by man.                                 BARTLEBYOne of the last sacred promises imparted to Peter the first Pope by the Sonof God before He left was "Whatever you hold true on earth..."                                   LOKI" ...I'll hold true in Heaven."                                 BARTLEBYSo if the Pope says it's so, God must adhere. It's dogmatic law.                                   LOKI(beat; extends hand)Let it never be said that your anal retentive attention to detail neveryielded positive results.                                 BARTLEBY(accepts hand)You can't be anal retentive if you don't have an anus.                                   LOKIThere's just one thing I think I should do before we leave - somethingthat'Il get us back on His good side.BARTLEBYWhat's that?Loki smiles and starts rifling through his pockets. He extracts a magazinearticle.                                   LOKIThis is something I've been dreaming about for five years now. Read.The crumpled article displays a Barney-like gold-hued cow, alongsidevarious profit charts and text.

BARTLEBYAre you nuts?!(crumples article)We're mere days away from getting back, and you want to jeopardize itbecause you have a soft spot for the good ol' days?!                                   LOKIWhat better way to show I've repented than by resuming the position Idenied... thanks to you.                                 BARTLEBYA killing spree is not going to make things better for us.                                   LOKIWe're not talking about killing here. We're talking about Divine Justice.We're talking about punishing the wicked, raining down fire and brimstone.He's all about that. I just know he'd want this done.                                 BARTLEBYThere hasn't been an Angel of Death since you quit. Doesn't that meananything to you? Besides, what if you're wrong?                                   LOKIIf I'm wrong, it won't matter. Like you said - we pass through the arch andwe're forgiven anywayThey step up to an elevator and press the button.                                 BARTLEBY(considering it)Well... he does hate competition.(reading article)And this Mooby deninitely falls under that heading.                                   LOKIThe church we have to go to is where?                                 BARTLEBYNew ]ersey. The Rededication is in four days.The doors open. They get on.

GIRLYou know, I've done this three times now; and each time the counselor tellsme I should be more careful in the future, I should show' someresponsibility. Gotta tell you, though - this is the first time thecounselor wasn't some ugly as hell old bitch.

So much so. that we decidedto go Carnegie Mellon together... that's this college in Pittsburgh. Sothere we are -away at school, and there's suddenly no parents to worryabout anymore, so we're screwing like rabbits - just constanly doing it.And I wound up getting pregnant. So he begs me to have it. He says weshould quit school and get married, and I'm telling him that that'lI screwup our educations. We fought about it for a week - my arguement being therewas no rush to have kids, you know? We could always have a baby in a coupleof years - after school. So I got the abortion against his wishes... Imean, what the hell - it was my body, right? After graduation, we gotmarried and immediately set about trying to have kids. We tried like hellfor the first six months, and... nothing. So I went to a gynocologist tosee if everything was okay on my end.                                  (beat)                                It wasn't.(takes a drink)My uteran wall had this fissure.

She pulls out achocolate cake and closes the door.INT BETHANY'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHTBethany sits on the couch, eating cake with a fork and watching the OC t.v.The theme song to Filmation's 'Batman and Robin' cartoon can be heard. Shesips some milk from a glass and has some more cake.INT BETHANY'S BEDROOM - NIGHTBethany's in bed, staring up at the ceiling. From the darkness, a creakingfloor board is heard. Bethany reacts, grabbing a bat from under her pillow.She peers into the darkness, defensively wielding her bat.Suddenly, the room explodes in flames. A huge fire that appears to beshooting out from the floor ignites mere feet from Bethany's bed. Bethanyleaps back, taking a beat to stare, mesmerized. Looking closely, one cansee an anthropomorphic form standing in the blaze.                                   VOICE(powerful; booming)BEHOLD THE METATRON - HERALD OF THE ALMIGHTY ANDVOICEOF THE ONE TRUE GOD!The Voice repeats itself. Bethany darts out of bed and dashes out of theroom, quickly returning with a fire extinguisher. While the voice is inmid-sentence, she blasts the thing with the contents of the canister,swirling the nozzle around to hit all the flames. The booming Voicesputters and starts coughing, losing it's impressive edge. Bethany stopssquirting and turns on her bedside lamp.A choking, drenched, and coughing androgynous figure in a suit waves heraway. The figure coughs up some of the extinguisher's contents and drops tothe floor, hacking. It is METATRON. Bethany stares, shocked.                                 METATRON(between coughs)Sweet. ..Jesus! Did you... have to empty...the whole can?!Bethany grabs her bat again and holds it up, this time offensively.                                  BETHANYWHO THE FUCK ARE YOU AND WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING IN MY ROOM?!                                 METATRON(slowly rising to it's feet)I'm the one... who's soaked and... she's the one who's pissed. That's rich!                                  BETHANY(reaching for phone, still holding bat)I'm calling the cops! Breaking and entering, attempted arson... they'regoing to lock you up for life...!

METATRONOr you'll what - hit me with that fish?The bat Bethany held is now a salmon. She drops it to the floor and freaks.                                 METATRONNow just sit down on the bed and shut up!                                  BETHANYOh God - you're going to rape me...

BETHANYTake whatever you want, just don't kill or rape me...                                 METATRONEnough with the raping already! I couldn't rape you if I wanted to.(unzips pants and pulls them off)Angels are ill-equipped.Bethany stares. There, before her, stands the exposed Metatron. There isnothing where some sexual genitalia should be - it's as smooth andanatomically impaired as a Ken doll.                                 METATRONSee? I'm as anatomically impaired as a Ken doll.(rings out pants)You meat-puppets and your arrogance - you think everyone's just waiting torape you.                                  BETHANYWh..what are you?                                 METATRONI'm pissed is what I am. You go around drenching everyone that comes intoyour room with flameretardent chemicals? No wonder you don't get laid.(pulls pants back on)Go get me a towel, will you?Bethany blinks. She exits the room and comes back with a towel. She holdsit out to Metatron who grabs it and starts toweling off.                                 METATRON(taking off jacket)Stand back.Bethany steps back. Metatron flexes and huge fucking wings extend from it'sback, dripping water. Bethany goes wide-eyed and cowers against the wall.                                 METATRON(tosses towel away)Like I was saying - I am the Metatron.Bethany stares, saying nothing, pinned against the wall. Metatron looksinsulted.                                 METATRONMetatron. Don't tell me the name doesn't ring a bell?Bethany remains silent and wideyed. Metatron gets testy.                                 METATRONYou people. If there isn't a movie about it, it's not worth knowing, right?                                  (beat)I am a seraphim.(beat)The highest choir of angels?(beat)You do know what an angel is, don't you?Bethany slowly nods.                                 METATRONMetatron acts as the voice of God. Any documented occasion when some yahooclaims to have spoken with God, they're speaking to me. Or they're speakingto themselves.                                 BET HANY                                  (beat)Why doesn't God speak for himself?                                 METATRONAh. So glad you decided to join the conversation. To answer that - humanbeings have neither the aural nor the psychological capacity to withstandthe awesomepower of God's true voice. Were you to hear it, you're mind would cave inand your heart would explode within your chest. We went through five Adam'sbefore we figured that out.                                  BETHANYAre you going to kill me?                                Ni ETATRONI could for what you did to this suit. Unfortunately I can't. You'recalled.

How about a tequila?(snaps fingers)INT MEXICAN BAR - NIGHTBethany and Metatron sit at a table. Bethany immediately clutches at herpajamas. Metatron waves a WAITER over.                                  BETHANYWhere the hell are we?!

METATRONActually, we're in the Chilli's down the street from your house, but it was                         still an impressive trick(lights smoke)You don't mind that I lost the wings, do you? I'm trying to keep ourprofile low.

METATRONCan you imagine how insulting it is to converse with a person and have theminsist you're a dream? If I had an ego, it'd be bruised.                                  BETHANYWhat do you want with me?                                 METATRONI'm to charge you with a holy crusade.(pause)You do know what a crusade is, don't you?                                  BETHANY(sarcastically)Uh, yeah.                                 METATRONDon't give me that. Last time I charged someone with a crusade they had tolook the word up.

METATRON(spits into empty glass)Details. Stop a couple of angels from entering and thus negating allexistence. God, I hate when people need it spelled out for them.                                  BETHANYClarify that.                                 METATRONThat's the problem with you people - you need every-thing clarified. Noleaps of faith whatsoever. Alright -vou want the whole secret origin? Heregoes: Back in the old days, God was vengeful and hot-tempered, and hiswrath was bore by the Angel of Death - name of Loki. When Sodom andGommorah were destroyed? That was Loki. When the waters wiped outeverything with the exception of Noah and his menagerie? That was Loki. Andhe was good at what he did. But one day, he refused to bear God's wrath anylonger.                                  BETHANYWhy?                                 METATRONBecause he listened to his friend - a Grigori by the name of Bartleby.                                  BETHANYGrigori?                                 METATRONOne of the choirs of angels. They're called Watchers. Guess what they do?                                  BETHANYSo they're like Guardian angels?                                 METATRONExactly like that, but different. So one day, Loki's wiping out all thefirst born of Egypt...                                  BETHANYThe Tenth Plague.                                 METATRONSee? Tell a person you're the Metatron and they stare at you blankiy;mention something out of a Charlton Heston movie and they're suddenlytheology scholars. May I continue uninterrupted?(Bethany nods)So once he's done with the first born, Loki takes his friend Bartleby outfor a post-slaughter drink. And over many rounds, they get into thisdiscussion about whether or not murder in the name of God is okay. Now,Bartleby can run circles around Loki intellectually, not to mention thefact that Loki's more than half in the bag, and in the end, Bartlebyconvinces Loki to quit his position and take a lesser one - one thatdoesn't involve slaughter. So - very inebriated - Loki tells God he quits:throws down his fiery sword, gives him the finger - which ruins it for therest of us. because from that day forward, God decreed that angels could nolonger imbibe alcohol. Hence all the spitting.                                  BETHANYSounds reasonable.                                 METATRONMaybe to you, but I'm a lush by nature.                                  BETHANYI mean about the angel of Death's resignation.                                 METATRONFor a liberal, yes, but this is the Angel of Death we're talking about. TheAngel of Death can't be a conscientious objector. The Angel of Death ischarged with meting out whatever justice God demands. So for theirinsolence, God decreed that neither Loki nor Bartleby would ever be allowedback into Paradise.                                  BETHANYWere they sent to Hell?                                 METATRONWorse. Wisconsin. For the entire span of human history. And when the worldends, they'll sit outside the gates for eternity.                                  BETHANYAnd what's this have to do with me?                                 METATRONSomebody's clued them in to a loophole in Catholic dogma that would allowthem to reenter Heaven.                                  BETHANYSo what? They beat the system. Good for them.                                 METATRONIt's not that simple. If they get in, they will have reversed God's decree.Now listen up because this part is very important: existence in all it'sform and splendor functions solely on one principle: God is infallible. Toprove God wrong would undo reality and everything that is. Up would becomedown, black would become white, existence would become nothingness. Inessence - if they are allowed to enter that church, they'll unmake theworld.                                  BETHANYAre these guys that bitter?                                 METATRONNo, that's the stupid part: they have no idea what their actions willresult in. As far as they know, they're just going home. Isn't that sweet?                                  BETHANYIf this is so major, why are you talking to me? Why doesn't God dosomething?                                 METATRONHe could. He could blink them out of existence, destroy that church, turnthem into plants. But He'd rather see you take care of this one personally.                                  BETHANYWhy me?                                 METATRONBecause of who you are.                                  BETHANYAnd who am I?                                 METATRONThe girl in the p.j.'s. Don't ask so many questions just serve yourpurpose.                                  BETHANYI'll pass.                                 METATRONI beg your pardon?                                  BETHANYWhen some asshole abortion doctor destroyed my uterus -where was God? Whenmyhusband decided he couldn't be with a wife that couldn't bear his children- where wasGod? Now all the sudden, after all these years of quiet noninvolvement inmy life, Hesends one of His lackey's my way who tells me I should save the world, andas what -some sort of test? To Hell with Him.                                 METATRONDo yourself a favor Bethany - do the world a favor: let go of your pettycrap. It's served you precious little in the past, and it serves you evenless now when the fate of existencehangs in the balance. Don't allow eons of history and life to get blinkedout of being just because you have a grudge against your creator.                                  BETHANYA grudge? Do you know why I work in that clinic? It's my own private way ofsaying"fuck you" to God.                                 METATRONAnd any other day I'd say that's your business and your life, and enjoyyourself and goodnight. But this isn't about you - this is about eve~body.So you lost the abiliry to make life. You're being offered the chance toplay mother to the world by acting like one and protecting it - saving it.(swigs her drink and spits it out)But I can't make you. You'll do what you will. However, if you shoulddecide to stop being selfish and accept your responsibility, you won't bealone. You'll have support.

The other one won't say anything, but he'll behelpfuljust the same.(looks at watch)I have to go. You'll do what you will, but try to remember that we'reworking in a time frame here.Metatron moves to exit.                                  BETHANY(beat)Hey.(Metatron turns)You work for God.                                 METATRONThey tell me it's God. If it's not, I'm going to be severely pissed - whatwith all these years of bossing people around on his behalf andexpectorating perfectly good tequila.                                  BETHANYWhat's he like? God?                                 METATRON(thinks)Lonely. But funny. He's got a great sense of humor.                                  BETHANYI'll bet.                                 METATRONLook at sex. Sex is funny. One time I asked him why you people had to lookso stupid while procreating. He said if you didn't, you'd do it all thetime, just for fun.                                  BETHANYBut we do.                                 METATRONI know. And you all look so damn stupid doing it. It kills us upstairs.                                  BETHANYSex is a joke in Heaven?                                 METATRONThe way I understand it, it's mostly a joke down here too.And with that, Nietatron is gone. Bethany looks at her drink. A three-manmariachi band surround her and begin playing Prince's 'Little RedCorvette'.INT BETHANY'S BEDROOM - NIGHTBethany startles awake. The radio on her night-table plays 'Little RedCorvette'. She lays back down.INT BETHANY'S OFFICE - DAYBethany sits at her desk, staring into space. A twenty-something girlspeaks, butBethany's not really listening. She's extremely preoccupied.INT CLINIC - NIGHTBethany shuts off the lights in the various rooms. She packs up her bag andturns on the alarm.EXT CLINIC - NIGHTBethany exits and locks the door behind her. She starts walking.As her feet tread lightly toward her car, three small shadows move towardher.Bethany throws her bag on her car roof and rumages through her purse forher keys. She hears something and stops. Roller blades can be heard movingslowly across the asphalt of the parking lot. Bethany turns quickly.Nobody's there. She looks around, a bit peturbed.                                  BETHANY(calling into the darkness)God, what time do you people quit and go home?! Let's just save it fortomorrow, alright?There's no response. Then there's the noise of wood being tapped againstthe ground. Bethany peers into the darkness, looking for the source.Suddenly, a skater whips past her, slamming his stick into the back of herknee. Bethany goes down. Another skater whips in and slashes at her, butshe ducks. The stick hits the car door above her. She rifles through herpurse madly until another skater whips by, dragging her purse away with hisstick. Bethany looks up.The Stygian Triplets are lined up menacingly, a few feet from her. They taptheir hockey sticks in unison on the ground. Bethany jumps up and facesthem defensively. The Triplets emit an unholy shriek and charge at her.And from out of nowhere, a large figure swoops down from above, landing onthe ground between Bethany and her menacers. The Triplets stop short andregard the figure curiously. The large figure whips into a defensivestance, Batman-style.The Stygian Triplets look to one another. They shrug and charge anew.From behind the rock-still large figure, a smaller figure leaps into thestreetlight, shrieking, flying through the air, busting into a flying kick.He lands before the middle Triplet and open-palm punches him twice in theface, grabbing his stick from the falling child's hand and tossing it intothe air behind him.The stick sails through the night air and is snatched by the grip of thelarge figure, who twirls it under his arm, and then back Out like a sai.

You can't go around breakingpeople's hearts like that! We fell in love with you!

The Man is face down, sooty, andashen - as if he's just been in a fire. Bethany drops to her knees androlls him over, feeling for a pulse.

Herolls it up and starts beating the kid in the head with it.Silent Bob gets his hands under the stick that pins him and pushes it uphard, into the Triplet's forhead, knocking him off. He rushes to Jay's sideand plies the other Triplet from his throat, hurling him OC.The Triplet Silent Bob fought 'punctures' the air with his stick and ripsdownward, creating a 'hole'. He grabs his friend and leaps into it,disappearing.Jay and Silent Bob look at eachother, blink, and embrace passionately.The Triplet that Rufus threw rushes Rufus from behind - hockey stick inlancing position. Without looking back, Rufus reaches behind himself,grabbing the stick and swinging it (and the Triplet) over his head in anarch, letting go. The last Triplet goes sailing through the 'hole', and itseals shut.Bethany, Jay and Silent Bob are in various wide-eyed states of shock.

I got here just in time.                                  BETHANYHow can you be so composed? We were almost killed.                                   RUFUSDeath is a worry of the living. The dead only worry about decay andnecrophiliacs.                                    JAYSee! I told you he was the undead!                                  RU FUSNot the undead, the dead. I died. Christ told me the secret to resurrectiononce when we were at a wedding in Canna, but I got drunk and forgot it.                                  BETHANY                               (incredulous)Wait. wait, wait - Christ? You knew Christ?                                   RUFUSKnew him? I saw him naked.

Been dead for nearly twothousand years. Here.(pulls rolled up paper from behind his ear)                                    JAYNo wonder he saw Jesus - homey's rockin' the ganj.

Freaked meout because he basically told me when my number was up. Took the flavor outof the remaining years. Look, we gotta keep moving. If we stay in one placelong enough, those things are liable to come back. What say we continuethis discussion over something to eat?                                  BETHANY(snaps)WAIT A SECOND!(inhales deeply)I'm a rational woman, okay. All I want to know is where you, and those...kids came from?!                                   RUFUSThey came from Hell. I came from Heaven.(walking away)Let's start walking.                                    JAYWalk? Do you know how far we are from anywhere?                                   RUFUSBack in the old days with J.C., we walked everywhere. Did you ever hear ofa fat apostle?(exits)Bethany looks to Jay and Silent Bob for some guidance or stability.                                    JAYWhat's an apostle?Bethany shakes her head and exits. Jay and Silent Bob shrug at each other.EXT MOOBY CORP. BUILDING - DAWNA large office building in downtown Cleveland. The city. hasn't started upyet. A pickup truck pulls curbside in front of the structure. Bartleby andLoki jump out of the back and pat the side of the truck. offering wavedthank-you's to the driver. As the truck pulls away, Loki pulls out thearticle and looks at it. He looks up at the building and nods to Bartleby,smiling. They head toward the front doors.INT QUAlNT SUBURBAN HOUSE - DAWNA ringing phone is answered by the unseen figure in the chair. We move fromthe seated Figure, passing by the dead bodies of the home's originalowners, and come to a stop on the bruised and worn Stygian Triplets seatedon a couch.

The best course of action is to insure that our parcel is notfound. And being that I can't even trust you enough to kill a girl, I'mleft with no choice but to seek outside assistance in guarding our package.(sighs)I'm going to have to summon the Golgothan.The Figure exits. The Stygian Triplets register shock.EXT FAST FOOD JOINT - DAWNRufus - now wearing some funky new clothes - carries a tray of fast food toan outdoor table. Sitting already are Bethany, Jay, and Silent Bob.                                   RUFUS(off new clothes)It's amazing the shit people throw out.

RUFUSLike what?                                  BETHANYLike - for starters - who the hell are those kids that keep attacking me?                                   RUFUSNasty little bastards called the Stygian Triplets. They're not reallyrelated. When they were alive they were a trio of kids that snatched aneighbor's toddler and smashed it's skull in - "just to see what it lookedlike" I believe was their defense. They were killed in a car wreck on theway to a detention center.                                  BETHANYSo they're dead too?                                   RUFUSYou'd be surprised how many dead people are just walking around - we'restubborn bastards. Thing is, those kids are supposed to be in Hell. Whichmeans that someone wants you out of the picture so badly they're willing tosummon demons.                                  BETHANYIs it those two angels I'm supposed to stop?                                   RUFUSCouldn't be. They're not evil - they're just stupid.                                    JAY(to Bethany)Wait a minute - are you going to listen to this shit? We don't even knowwho this guy is. For all you know, he's in with those fucks. They bothshowed up at the same time.                                  BETHANYI hate to say it - but he does have a point. How did you know where to findus?                                   RUFUSYou know what the dead do with most of their time? They watch the living.Especially in the shower.                                    JAY(to Silent Bob)I can't wait to die.                                  BETHANYAnd why are you watching me?                                   RUFUSBecause you're the one who's going to help me get some changes made in thatbook you all hold so much stock in.                                    JAYHustler?

JAYNeither are any of us, but you don't hear us bitching.                                   RUFUSBut I'm supposed to be in it. I was the Thirteenth Apostle.                                  BETHANYI've been going to church my entire life and I've never heard of athirteenth apostle named Rufus.                                   RUFUSSee? You know all about the other twelve Apostles -white boys, I might add.But no mention of Rufus. And why? Cause I'm a black man. But that's just mypet peeve. I mainly want to correct a major error that you people arebasing a faith on.                                  BETHANYWhat's that?                                   RUFUSJesus wasn't white; He was black.Rufus bites into his sandwhich. Bethany, Jay and Silent Bob look at him andthen each other.                                    JAYBullshit. I've seen pictures of Jesus, and He has blonde hair and blueeyes.                                   RUFUS(wiping hands)That's what's particularly insulting. Between the time when He establishedthe faith and the church started to officially organize, the powers-that-bedecided that while the message of Christ was integral, the fact that He wasblack was a detriment. So all renderings were ordered to be Eurocentric,even though the brother was blacker than Jesse.                                  BETHANYIf that's true, then why'd He get written about while you were left out?                                   RUFUSWell He is the Son of God, right? It's kind of hard to have the NewTestament without him. So you fudge a few facts and put a spin on Hisethnicity. Leaving me out's okay because there's still Twelve apostles tochoose from.                                    JAYI don't buy it.                                   RUFUSThat's what the good people of Antioch were saying when they stoned my ass.                                  BETHANYYou were martyred?                                   RUFUSThat's one way of putting it. Another way is to say I was bludgeoned toshit by big rocks. See - Christ told us Apostles to go out into the worldand spread His word. Antioch was already garnering a big Christianfollowing, so I got sent there. And was a big hit. They loved hearing aboutJesus' message, and how He was the Redeemer. But when I mentioned He wasblack, the whole town turned on me - called me a liar and shit. I pressedthe point, and before I know it, I'm wearing stones - although not toaccessonze.                                 BETH ANYWhy didn't you just let the point go when you saw how they were reacting?                                   RUFUSBecause it's part of the facts. White folks only want to hear the goodshit: life eternal, a place in God's kingdom. As soon as they hear they'regetting all this from a black Jesus, they freak. And that - my friends - iscalled Hypocrisy. Folks just can't accept a black Savior.(to Silent Bob)You going to eat that hash brown?                                  BETHANYSo you went to Heaven?                                   RUFUSShit yeah; it was the least the brother could do. I gave up my sheep andfollowed His ass around Jerusalem for three years. And in all that time,did I ever get laid? Hell no! But I didn't bitch, because I was into Hismessage. And while the message is what counts, folks should know that Hewas black. That's why I'm going to help you find stop those angels fromgetting to that church in exchange for you helping me with my campaign.                                  BETHANYHow do you know about that?                                   RUFUSHeaven's a pretty boring place, and anything that breaks the tedium isnews. The unmaking of existence is what you might consider a greattediumbreaker. Besides, there isn't much I don't know about you.                                  BETHANYI find that hard to believe.                                   RUFUSWhen you were five you let a kid from next door piss on your hand.                                    JAY(shocked)You did that?                                  BETHANYYeah... but I never told anyone about it.                                   RUFUSNeither did he. He died of Leukemia two years later.

Probably inHell, too.Bethany rubs her temples and exits OC. Rufus watches her go.                                    JAY(intrigued)Tell me something about me.                                   RUFUS(preoccupied with the OC Bethany)You masturbate more than anybody else on the planet.                                    JAYShit, everyone knows that. Tell me something nobody knows.                                   RUFUSYou think about guys when you do it.Rufus gets up and exits. Silent Bob looks at Jay, shocked.                                    JAYNot all the time!Bethany sits on a swing in the kiddie-jungle gym, shaking her head. Rufusjoins her.                                   RUFUSI'm sorty if I spooked you.                                  BETHANYI just feel... violated. Like my life isn't mine exclusively.                                   RUFUSThat's the way it goes with celebrities.                                  BETHANYWhat are you talking about? I'm a nobody. I'm just a quiet girl from thesuburbs who counsels pregnant teens.                                   RUFUSYou sound like Christ. He had the same reaction when He found out who Hewas, minus the quiet girl from the 'burbs angle. And like Him, I'm sureyou'll come to terms and do what you're supposed to.                                  BETHANYWhy not get the pope or someone holy like that?                                   RUFUSJust because a guy wears a funny hat, doesn't make him the right man forthe job.

RUFUSCan't say yet. But the question is - are your hands capable enough to carrythe burden. It all rides on you.                                  BFTRANY(rubbing her temples)Two thirds of me wants to forget about this and go home. You know,yesterday I wasn't sure God even existed. And now I'm upto my ass inChristian Mythology.                                   RUFUSGod hates it when it's referred to as Mythology.                                  BFTHANYWell then let's ask the quote, unquote 'prophets' what we should call itinstead.(looking OC; concerned)Now where did those two assholes go?INT STRIP JOINTIt's your typical strip club. One woman on a stage and a crowd of menpaying way-too-much attention. The place is dimly lit with red lights andchock full of smoke. Off to one side, a dee-jay spins records, blasting themusic. The crowd is rather thin.Jay and Silent Bob sit at the stage. their eyes glued on...The DANCER - a gorgeous, shapely vixen with very little clothing on, andgrowing littler by the second.Jay pokes Silent Bob, who produces a wad of bills. They skim off a nicepile and stow the rest. They spread their piles neatly on the bar. TheDancer smiles and starts dancing toward them. Jay holds up a five-spot andperforms his own little seductive dance ~th it. He stands at the edge ofthe stage, ~'rating. The Dancer slinks over and Jay stuffs the five in herG-string. She rubs his head and slinks away. Jay humps Silent Bob's chair,excitedly. Bethany and Rufus come up from behind them. Bethany hits Jay.                                  BETHANY(shouting above the music)What are you doing?                                    JAYProving to this bastard that I ain't gay.                                  BETHANYWhat?                                   RUFUSLong story - forget it. But we should get moving. How can we get to NewJersey?                                  BETHANYI had a car.She slaps Jay upside the head, but - riveted by the Dancer - he doesn'tfeel it.                                  BETHANY(to Rufus)We could go by train.                                   RUFUS(looking OC)Sounds cool.                                  BETHANYThere's a phone out there. I'll call for reservations.Rufus is now also riveted by a table dancer off to the side.                                  BETHANYNo, it's okay. I can handle it.Rufus half-nods. Bethany shakes her head and exits.The Dancer gyrates on the stage, revealing more and more of herself.Jay pounds on the stage, hoots, and dances, flashing more bills.ACROSS THE STAGE a small GANG of bandanna-wearing, angry-looking blackswatch the OC Jay with little amusement. The Dancer dances toward them.                                    JAY(banging on stage)Sweet thing!(Hashes another five)Look what I found! Snoog!The Dancer smiles as she approaches Jay, but is interrupted by morebanging.The GANG LEADER has his foot on the stage. He produces a ten dollar billfrom his jacket and casually holds it up. The other three members of hisposse smile and slap hands.The Dancer shrugs at the shocked Jay and changes direction, heading towardthe Gang. Jay casts a horrified look at Silent Bob.The Gang Leader leans forward, preparing to tip when we hear an obnoxiouslyloud throat~learing.Jay holds aloft a twenty, smiling and nodding.The Dancer shrugs at the Gang Leader and again switches direction. The GangLeader looks at his posse, who shake their heads at him, disappointedly.The Stage becomes a bidding table, as - on one side - the Gang Leaderproduces two twenties. On the other side, jay - staring at the Gang Leader- produces three twenties. The Gang Leader hits his posse up for more cash.Jay hits Silent Bob up for more cash. The Dancer stays in the middle,gyrating and sizing up the best offer.Jay then produces the creme'de Ia creme': three hundred dollar bills. Hesneers at the OC Gang Leader. The Dancer heads over to jay and wraps herlegs around him from the stage, gyrating against his groin. Jay stares atthe Gang Leader, a victorious smirk on his face.The Gang Leader shakes his head angrily and jumps out of his seat,producing a gun from his jacket. He fires into the ceiling. The musicscratches to a halt and the other viewers scatter toward the door. The GangLeader points his piece at Jay, his posse backing him up.                                GANG LEADERYou a smart ass, ain'tcha, white boy? Come in here and ruin my good time.                                    JAYIt's a free country. The bitch just came to the man with the most.                                  DANCERBitch?                                    JAYNo offense, baby.                                GANG LEADERThe bitch is gonna be leaving with the man with the most - the man with themost led in his piece. While you and tubby are leaving with the most led inyour dead fucking carcasses, know what I'm sayin?                                    JAY(to Dancer)Step to the side, baby. I've gotta slap this pussyass, Nino Brown wanna-bedown.                                  DANCER(to Gang Leader)Come on, Kane. This isn't necessary.                                GANG LEADERShut the fuck up and back away from the midget!The Dancer moves to the side.                                GANG LEADER(to Jay)Now I believe you were about to apologize. I believe you were about tointone some pleas for mercy. You were about to say "Please, Mister Kane, Ididn't mean to disrespect you in your club. Please accept my most humbleapology.Bethany comes back and sees the mess. She moves to rush to Jay's side, butRufus holds her back An OC Jay laughs.Jay leans on Silent Bob, laughing. The Gang stares back, angrily.                                    JAYYou want an apology?                                GANG LEADER(cocks gun)Give me at least one "I'm sorry," and ltll put a kill shot through thatthick fucking skull of your's. Otherwise we go slow and long in the paindispensation.                                    JAY(beat; zips jacket closed)Know what I'm doing?                                GANG LEADERNo. What you doing?                                    JAYI'm closing my jacket, so that when we start this up, I don't get yourfilthy fucking brain guts all over my shirt. You know why?                                GANG LEADERWhy?                                    JAYBecause you can't get shit stains out of flannel. What I'm saying is thatyou got shit for brains.The Gang Leader and his posse stare silently for a moment.                                GANG LEADERWell I appreciate you breaking that down for me, but I got it without theexplanation.                                    JAYNo. No, I don't think you did get it. See, there's gonna he some nine'sfiring in here, and when the bullets stop flyin', your cunt-lip ass isgonna be all holes and smoke. You think you can draw on me and walk away?Fuck that. And fuck you - you punk-ass monkey bitch! Yeah, I called you amonkey! Maybe if you kiss my dick all nice before I cap you, I'll bring acoconut to your funeral and lay it on your grave; stick a straw through itand stick the other end in the ground. Your lips'll reach.The Gang stares, mystified. Rufus and Bethany can't move they're sofrightened.                                    JAYYou think every white boy cowers at your ass? Shit, if I don't fuckingplant you - watermelon - my muscle here will.(thumbs at Silent Bob)What do you think he is? My boy friend? I love chicks. So he's gotta bewith me for one reason: to watch my back. Silent Bob doesn't talk in words- he speaks in bullets. Re's all quiet cause he's thinking about how he'sgonna take you and your bitches out quick enough to piss on the bullets inyour bodies before they cool down. You know why? Because he likes to seethe hot steam coming off them when he sprays them down. Come to think ofit, I~m tired of talking to your dumb ass; you probably don't evenunderstand big words like 'piss'. Tell you what - I'll let him explain itto you.(to Silent Bob)Silent Bob - shoot these punk-monkey bitches.Silent Bob slowly raises his hands in a surrender fashion. Jay looks athim.                                    JAYWhat are you waiting for?!Silent Bob shrugs.                                    JAY(flabbergasted)YOU DON'T RAVE A GUN?!?Silent Bob kind of nods                                    JAY(shocked)WHAT THE FUCK DO YOU MEAN? ALL THIS TIME WE'VE BEEN TOGETHER, AND YOU DON'THAVE A GUN?!?Silent Bob indicates the negative, sheepishly.                                    JAYTHAT'S JUST FUCKING GREAT! DO YOU THINK IWOULD'VE SAID ALL THAT IF I'D KNOWN YOUDIDN'T HAVE A GUN?!?(beat)HUNHH?!?Silent Bob raises his eyebrows remorsefully. The Gang snickers and smiles.GANG LEADERWhat was that about a coconut?Jay shakes his head and glowers at Silent Bob.                                    JAYNo gun! What the fuck kind of muscle are you?! All this time and you got nogun!GANG LEADEROh boys! We have some unfinished business here.                                    JAY(sheepishly)Can we talk this over?                                GANG LEADERTell you what - you got thirty seconds. Then I cap you. Talk all you like.Bethany goes to make a move, but Rufus holds her back, shaking his head. Heputs a finger to his lips to quiet her and points back toward the action,smiling.Jay fumes.                                    JAY(to Silent Bob)I can't believe you.(to Gang Leader)Do me a favor.(points to Silent Bob)Shoot this piece of shit first.(to Silent Bob; disgusted)No gun!Suddenly, they both snap into a momentary trance. Zombie-like, Jay andSilent Bob step to the turntables behind them. Jay puts on headphones andbegins scratching a record. A familiar tune begins.The Gang watches, perplexed.Silent Bob whips around, microphone in his hand, and begins to sing.                                SILENT BOBHEY, HEY, HEY!!! IT'S FAT ALBERT!AND I'M GONNA SING A SONG FOR YOU!!AND BILL'S GONNA TELL YOU A THING OR TWO!!WE'LL HAVE SOME FUN, NOW!WITH BILL AND ALL THE GANG!LEARNING FROM EACH OTHER -WHILE WE DO OUR THANG!The Gang slowly goes from perplexity to enjoyment. The Gang Leader softensand smiles, adding a slight nod of approval. Jay provides back-up.                                    JAYNA , NA, NA! GON NA HAVE A GOOD TIME!                                SILENT BOB(as Fat Albert)HEY! HEY! HEY!                                    JAYNA. NA. NA! GONNA HAVE A GOOD TIME!Bethany and Rufus look on. amazed.                                   RUFUSI thought she looked familiar.                                  BETHANYWho?                                   RUFUS(he nods toward the stage)Serendipity.Bethany looks to the stage.The Dancer is the SERENDIPITY in question. She wipes sweat from her brow.INT. MOOBY CORP. BOARDROOM - DAYOh, this isn't your standard boardroom; this is Mooby Corp., home of Mooby,the Golden Calf - which can only be described as a bovine variation onBarney: sickeningly simple and very non-threatening. A large table sits inthe middle, a media center behind the huge chair at the head. The walls areadorned with framed posters of Mooby, playing with kids, mouth agape in astupid smile. At the center of the table is a large, gold plated statue ofthe insipid creature.Doors open and the boardroom fills with suits - six men, one woman. Theychatter and take their seats. After a beat, WHITLAND, the CEO, enters,taking his place at the head of the conference table.                                 WHITLANDGood morning, shoppers.(slaps a file on table)Has anyone seen the over-night's?An anticipatory hush fills the room.                                 WHITLANDWe creamed 'em.A cheer and applause goes up from the group. Whitland smiles.                                 WHITLAND(reading from file)And last night was a rerun, which says to me that with the six months wehave to ready and promote the 'Very Nlooby Christmas' pay-per-view special,we can produce history-making numbers. The record is held by thatshock-jock's New Year's thing, but I see no reason why our little cash cowcan't supercede those numbers and...(stops and sniffs the air)Do I smell onions?Bartleby and Loki sit behind the thrall on a black leather couch. Loki iscarving something out of an onion, while Bartleby looks on.Whitland and the rest of the board stare at them.                                 WHITLANDI didn't realize we had guests. Who are these gentlemen with?The other suits shrug and look to one another for an answer nobody has.                                 WHITLAND(to Bartleby and Loki)Excuse me.Loki continues carving. Bartleby looks at his friend and shakes his head.Loki lifts his head without looking up.                                   LOKI(very distracted)Hmm?                                 WHITLANDMay I ask what you're doing in my boardroom?                                   LOKI(still preoccupied)My friend just has a few words for you, and then we'll be on our way.Heading to Jersey, you see. Now -by the decor, I assume I'm guessingcorrectly that this is the corporate headquarters for Mooby ProductionsInternational?                                 WHITLANDYou guess correctly. Now, may I ask who the fuck you are and - again - whatthe fuck you're doing in our conference room?                                   LOKI(to Bartleby, still not looking up)You may proceed, mon ami'.                                 BARTLEBYI can't believe you.(to Whitland)I just want to start off by apologizing. My friend here has a penchanttoward the dramatic, so he's making me do this. Usually, I don't eveninvolve myself in his affairs, but he hasn't done this in awhile, so hewants...                                   LOKI(frustrated)Just read 'em their rights already.                                 BARTLEBY(sighs; circling the table)Mooby, the Golden Calf. Created by Nancy Goidruff -a former kindergartenteacher - in nineteen eighty nine to fill a gap in the Saturday morningschedule on local network K-REL Bought by the Complex Corporation innineteen ninety one and broadcast nationally as the 'The Mooby Fun-TimeHour', it picked up a large following of children, ages three to eight, andspawns sixteen records, two theatrical films, eight prime-time specials, alibrary of priced-to-own video cassettes, and bicoastal theme parks dubbed'MoobyWorld'.(beat)Did I miss anything?Whitland and company stare for a beat.                                 WHITLANDYou forgot 'Mooby Magazine'. Is there a point to this?                                 BARTLEBY(grimly)You and your board are idolators.Whitland and company stare dumbfounded. Loki finishes carving and standsbeside Bartleby.                                   LOKI(to Bartleby)How could your forget the magazine?Bartleby rolls his eyes. Loki turns to the Whitland and holds up thesculpture.                                   LOKIIt's you.(sets sculpture on table)Do you know much about voo-doo? Fascinating practice, very close toSatanism, but not really much of a religion - no doctrine of faith. Just anarrangements of superstitions, the most well- known of which is the voo-doodoll.(sneezes; waits; continues)A mock-up of an individual is subjected to various pokes and prods, and thedesired result is that the individual will feel the effects.                                 WHITLAND(to nearest board member)Call security - now.Loki throws the knife at the table, severing the phone cord.                                   LOKIAll lines are currently down.                                 BARTLEBY(to Whitland)Again -. I apologize for my friend's...                                   LOKI(frustrated)Would you just get on with it?!                                 BARTLEBY(miffed; to Whitland)You are responsible for raising an icon that draws worship from the Lord.You've broken the first commandment, but more than that, I'm afraid none ofyou passes for a decent human being. Your continued existence is a mockeryof morality.(looks to Loki; Loki nods)Like you - Mister Bernard.(stands behind board member)Last year you cheated on your wife of seventeen years, eight times - twicewith prostitutes. You even had sex with her best friend while she was ather garden club meeting and you were supposed to be watching your kids.                                   LOKIIn the bed you and your wife share, no less.The board member stares in disbelief. Loki nods to Bartleby and he moveson.                                  BARTLBYAnd you, Mister Newman.Loki sifts through compact discs. He pulls out one entitled 'Mooby Mania'and pops it into a player. A simple children's song echoes through theroom.                                 BARTLEBYYou got your girlfriend drunk at last year's Christmas party, and then paida kid from the mailroom to have sex with her while she was passed out, justso you could break up with her - guilt free - when she sobbingly confessedthe next morning that she cheated on you. She killed herself three monthslater. You sent flowers to her wake.The board member's face is frozen. Bartleby shakes his head and movesquickly around the table.                                 BARTLEBY(not liking his job)Mister Pereira disowned his gay son; Mister Turran put his mother in athird-rate nursing home and used the profits from the sale of her house topurchase an oriental rug for himself; Mister Barker flew to the Phillipineson the company account to have sex with an eleven year old boy; MisterBloom okayed the production of Mooby dolls from what he knew were unsafeand toxic materials because it was less costly.Bartleby stops at the female Board member and looks at her, relieved.                                 BARTLEBYYou, on the other hand, are an innocent. You lead a good life and havenever misused your power here.She stares at Bartleby. Loki pats her on the back and urges Bartleby on.                                 BARTLEBYBut you, Mister Whitland. You have more skeletons in your closet than thisassembled party. I can't even mention them aloud.Bartleby leans over and whispers something unheard into Whitland's ear.Whitland goes green. Bartleby steps back. Loki stands beside Whitland.                                   LOKIYou're her father, you sick fuck.Whitland begins sobbing.                                 BARTLEBY(to Loki)Can I go now?                                   LOKI(cheerily rubbing his head)Go on, you crazy kid.Bartlebv exits. Loki turns menacingly on the others.                                   LOKIWith the exception of Miss Pryce, there is not a decent human being amongstyou. Do you know what makes a human being decent?(beat)Fear. And therein lies the problem. None of you has anything to fearanymore. You rest comfortably in seats of inscrutable power, hiding behindyour false idol, far from judgement - lives shrouded in secrecy even fromone another. But not from God.Loki goes to exit but pauses. He turns around.                                   LOKII forgot my little voo-doo doll.(looks at Whitland)Wow. It really does look just like you. Maybe, if I believed enough...Loki begins moaning menacingly, slowly waving an open palm over the figure.Whitland looks at it horrified, then at Loki, then back at the figure. Hesweats and shifts in his seat - eyes pinned on the figure. Loki lets out ashriek and smashes the figure with his fist. Whitland freezes, eyes closed.Slowly, he opens his eyes - unharmed.                                   LOKII don't believe in voo-doo.Loki swiftly exits. The Board Members sit in awed silence. Then the doorsburst open and Loki storms back in.                                   LOKIBut I do believe in this.Gun blazing, he takes out the male board members, including Whitland, in aflurry of bullets. The remaining female Board Member covers her head withher arms. Loki hangs his arm at his side and touches her hair.                                   LOKI(smiling)It's okay. You've done nothing wrong. They were bad men. You are a puresoul.She looks at him, terrified. He smiles back. Then his expression hardens.                                   LOKIBut you didn't say 'God Bless You' when I sneezed.He quickly puts the gun to her head. She slams her eyes shut.

The female Board Member slowly opensher eyes and looks around.INT STRIP JOINT - LATERJay and the Gang Leader sit together at a table, surrounded by the othergangsters and Silent Bob. They laugh and chug their '40's.                                GANG LEADER(to Gang)Watch this shit.(to Jay)Do it again, G. Do the Mush-mouth.                                    JAY(swigs his beer; as 'Mush-mouth')Hey-buh, Fat-buh, Al-buh-bert.The Gang laughs hysterically.                                GANGSTER 1Fat Albert like a mother fucker and shit!Bethany, Rufus, and Serendipity huddle around a table further away.                                   RUFUS(elated)I forgot you were down here! How long now?                                SERENDIPITYThree years this August. What about you - is this another temporaryexpulsion? You and your 'Christ was down' campaign?                                  BETHANYWhat does that mean - another expulsion? I thought you came down herespecifically to help me?SERENDIPITYIs that what he told you? Rufus gets thrown out constantly; at least once amonth, ethereal time. They always bring him back, but only after a few daysof peace and quiet - free from that black nationalist rhetoric.                                   RUFUS(joking)Artsy-fartsy bitch.                                SERENDIPITYWho you calling artsy-fartsy?                                   RUFUS(to Bethany)Serendipity here used to hang with us sometimes back in Jerusalem.                                  BETHANYLet me guess - the fourteenth apostle; left out of the bible because she'sa woman.                                   RUFUSThe girl's not a woman.(to Serendipity)No offense.                                  BETHANYOh, those weren't tits I saw Jay cozying up to?                                SERENDIPITY(tugs on boobs)What, these? You should know better than anyone at this table that titsdon't make a woman.                                   RUFUSHell, the tubby, coat-wearing mother fucker's got tits - don't make him awoman.                                SERENDIPITYAside from an intuitive knack for accessorizing, what traditionally definesa woman falls between two things : her legs. But as you can see...Serendipity stands and unbuttons her jeans, dropping them slightly,revealing yet another smooth, sexless crotch, quite like Metatron's.                                SERENDIPITYI lack definition.                                  OC JAYHey! They're getting a free show!Serendipity pulls her pants back up and sits down, smiling at the OC party.                                  BETHANY(weary)Oh God. Another angel. Like Metatron.                                SERENDIPITYHow do you know Metatron?(to Rufus)How does she know Metatron?                                   RUFUSThis is the last Scion.                                SERENDIPITY(beat)You're kidding.                                   RUFUSDon't you see the resemblance?                                SERENDIPITY(stares at Bethany)A bit.(suddenly nervous)Oh shit. If she's been tapped, then something's up.                                  BETHANYI'm confused.                                   RUFUSBethany, Serendipity here isn't technically an angel, nor is she by anymeans a human being like I was and you are.SERENDIPITYAmen to that.(swigs her beer and spits it out)                                  BETHANYThen who is she?                                SERENDIPITYNot who - what. I haven't always been part of the anthropomorphic club. Iused to be an abstract.                                  BETHANYNow I'm really lost.                                   RUFUSSerendipity's an idea.                                SERENDIPITYTry all ideas.                                  BETHANYMeaning?                                SERENDIPITYI'm a muse, stupid.Bethany stares at her for a beat, then at Rufus. Rufus nods affirmatively.                                  BETHANYI can't take much more of this.(downs her beer)                                   RUFUS(to Serendipity)She's now met a seraphim, a dead man, and a muse.You can appreciate her frame of mind.                                  BETHANY(to Serendipity)So you - what - inspire people?                                SERENDIPITYWhat just went down with your friends over there-you don't think theythought of that themselves? I knew Kane's weak spot for Fat Albert andpassed it along to the boys.                                   RUFUSIf she hadn't interceded, they'd be chalk lines right now.                                  BETHANYYou made them sing that song?                                SERENDIPITYI offered them a solution out of the hole they dug for themselves.Thankfully, they took it.                                  BETHANYAre you kidding? Those two are so dense, they wouldn't get a good idea ifit was given to them in a specially marked box.                                SERENDIPITYDense people are the most open to suggestion - it's vou so-calledintelligent folks that have a hard time accepting a good idea.                                   RUFUSAin't that the truth.                                  BETHANYProve it. Give me a good idea.                                SERENDIPITYIf I do, and you accept it, then you'll have confirmation that you are - asyou say - dense.                                  BETHANY(beat)Alright. So you're a muse. So what kind of people do you inspire - besidesstupid ones?                                SERENDIPITYI used to specialize in entertainment - literature, theatre, so forth.                                  BETHANYMovies?                                SERENDIPITYIn some cases, I'd do everything but bang starlets on the casting couch.                                  BETHANYWhat have I seen that you've been involved with?                                SERENDIPITYOff the top of my head - everything. Well almost everything. For example:I'm responsible for nine of the ten top grossing films of all time.                                  BETHANYNine?                                SERENDIPITYThe one about the kid, by himself in his house; burglars trying to get inand he fights them off?(Bethany nods)I had nothing to do with that one. Somebody sold their soul to Satan to getthe grosses up on that piece of shit.                                   RUFUSWhich brings us to the next logical question - what are you doingstripping?                                SERENDIPITYWell you remember why I left, right?                                   RUFUSYou were tired of doing all the work and getting none of the credit foryour ideas.                                SERENDIPITYAnd sick of watching incapable people take brilliant inspiration and turnout real trash.(to Bethany)So I opted to quit being a muse and write for myself. I gave my two weeksnotice. got a body, fifty bucks, and got sent out into the world to make myfortune.                                  BETHANYSo what happened?                                SERENDIPITYWriter's block.                                   RUFUSWriter's block?                                SERENDIPITYCan you believe it? Me - a muse, for God's sake! I sit down in front of thetypewriter, and what do I get? Nothing. Blank page. 1 can't even write agrocery list.                                  BETHANYWhat about what you did with Jay and Silent Bob? You inspired them.                                SERENDIPITYThat's the cosmic joke. I can give out a zillion and nine ideas a second,but I can't keep any for myself. Her quirky sense of humor.                                  BETHANYWhose?                                SERENDIPITYGod's.                                  BETHANYYou're saying God's a woman.                                SERENDIPITYWas there ever a doubt in your mind?                                  BETHANYThe possibility never presented itself. He's always referred to as a Him.                                SERENDIPITYI didn't write it that way My job stops at the idea stage. The person thatholds the pen adds their own perspective, and all the pen-holders were men.One of the drawbacks to being intangible is that you have no say in theeditorial process.                                   RUFUSAnother one's that you can't jerk off.                                SERENDIPITY(to Bethany)See. these being male-dominated times, the Pharisees and High Priests feltthreatened by the idea of a woman lording over them and controlling theirfates. so they made sure that She became a He Doesn't stop with God - thewhole book is slanted and gender-biased: a woman's responsible for thefirst sin, the fall of man, and the expulsion from Eden. a woman cutsSampson's coif of power, a woman asks for the head of John the Baptist.Read that book again some time - women are painted as bigger antagoniststhan the fucking Egyptians and Romans combined.                                  BETHANY(stunned)God is a woman...                                SERENDIPITYI don't know what the big surprise is - women are the only gender that cancreate life, just like God created the universe. Who else but a mothercould have the infinite patience with impudent children that God has withhumanity. A woman can give birth to and nurture both sexes, sopsychologists theorize that women are the only gender both sexes can feelcompletely comfortable with; and the faithful - both male and female - feelat ease with God. In time of trial, our first instinct is to implore theaid of the Almighty, just as when you're a child, the only person who canmake it all better is...                                  BETHANY...mom. God, it makes sense.                                   RUFUS(to Serendipity)Shit, you still have a knack for words.                                SERENDIPITYNot really useful in my new line of work.                                   RUFUSWhat about that? Why'd you choose stripping?                                SERENDIPITYIn an effort to create something artistic that I could claim as my own.See, I've been able to fool myself into thinking this isn't stripping, it'sdancing; and at least dancing is artistic. But She won't even give me thatmuch - the way God designed dance, it's the only creative act which resultsin no tangible product. Unlike paintings, poems, movies or most other artsforms. when the dance is over, there's nothing to show for it - nothing tosave and enjoy... or sell.(takes a drink)Believe me, the irony wasn't lost on this muse.                                   RUFUSHow long are you going to keep this up?                                SERENDIPITYBelieve me, I think about eating crow and going back to the grind from timeto time. But I'd hate to give Her the satisfaction of my playing theprodigal. And it sucks because I can't stand being flesh anymore -especially this halfway crap. Not only do I have to take care of theaesthetic - the showers, the haircutting, the pit-shaving - but I can'ttake advantage of the benefits - like getting laid or using my period as anexcuse not to get laid...(conspiratorily to Bethany)...the only true boon to having a period, from what I understand.                                   RLFLSWell we could sure use your help. We need someone with good ideas. Youremember a couple of angels named Loki and Bartleby?SERENDIPITYSure - the angel of death and his squeamish pal with a conscience.                                   RUFUSThey found a way back.                                SERENDIPITY(shocked)God no. Not the plenary indulgence loop hole?                                  BETHANYYou know about that?                                SERENDIPITYI always knew that thing was a bad idea. Leave it to the Catholics todestroy existence.

SERENDIPITYEver been to a Catholic mass?                                  BETHANYOnce or twice.                                SERENDIPITYIt's like bad sex - up, down, up, down, kneel, leave.And the whole time you'd rather be watching t.v.You people don't celebrate your faith - you mourn it.                                  BETHANYSo if we're so wrong, then what's the right religion?                                SERENDIPITYWhen are you people going to learn? It's not about right or wrong - it's aquestion of faith. It doesn't matter what you believe in - just that youbelieve.Jay and Silent Bob join them, wearing bandannas.                                    JAYLook! They made me and Silent Bob part of the gang!Suddenly, the doors behind them blast open, pouring light into the onc~imroom.

Represent!The Gang charges OC, guns blazing, while we hold on the group. Suddenly,the room is filled with screams and wet, slurpy noises. The group goes fromstaring wide-eyed, to shielding themselves. The noise stops and Jay andSilent Bob look up.The Gang lay about NoMan in trashed, dead positions. They are covered inmurky, creamy crap - their wide, white eyes frozen in horror. NoMan scoopsa finger-full of muck off the leader and eats it, smiling.Our heroes start backing up slowly, as to not be noticed.

SERENDIPITY(peering above)Yeah, well it wasn't just Christ up there - the Romans crucified everybodyon that hill. Ahd Christ excluded, they were all criminals - killers,brigands, thieves, rapists. And whenever the crucified expired, theirbodies would naturally lose muscle control, spilling bowel and bladder inthe process. And the result is that walking pile of crap up there: theGolgothan Shit-Demon - Hell's chief assassin. And he's here for you,girlie.Silent Bob stares at a crack in the doors. A milky drop of shit dripsthrough it.                                  BETHANYWhat are we doing down here, then?. Any second now he'll be blastingthrough that door!

MANAnd now, to speak on behalf of his Holiness' 'Catholicism - Wow!' campaign,ladies and gentlemen of the press, I give you the driving force behind themovement - Cardinal Glick.The reporters clap as CARDINAL GLICK takes to the podium. He strikes one asmore of an agent than a man of the cloth as he removes his Wayfarers.                                   GLICKThank you, Mister Flanagan - one of this parish's chief patrons, whodonated the stained-glass likeness of Our Lady of Gleeful Misery thatwelcomes you as you enter the church every Sunday.(off index cards)Ladies and Gentlemen of the press - few would deny that the Catholic Churchhas fallen behind somewhat in the times. Catholicism usually strikes theaverage person as an old-fashioned remedy for the ills - both moral andpsychological - of a society that has since left it's stringent rules andornate rituals on the heap with 45's and eight track cassettes. And in aneffort to disprove that, the Church has appointed this year as a time ofrenewal, both of faith and of style. So, it is with great pleasure, that Ipresent you and your parish - mere days away from it's centennialcelebration - and the continental United States, via Satellite with thefirst of man revamps that the 'Catholicism -Wow!' campaign will unveil overthe next year.

No.We're simply talking about a few minor alterations to both the aestheticand theoretical aspects of a religion that boasts one of the highestmembership numbers on the planet.A few applause ring out. Glick smiles.                                   GLICKThank you, thank you. So what are we talking about here. Well, forexample...(pulls out crucifix)while it has been a time-honored and traditional symboL of our faith, wehave decided to retire the highly recognizable, yet wholely depressingsymbol of our Lord, Jesus Christ, crucified.

I've got enoughdowners in my daily routine without having to deal with this visualeverytime I go to worship. lnstead, the church is going to adopt this new,more soothing and inspiring sigil, which we feel is in-line with our newoutlook.Glick pulls a cover off an object to his right - a two foot figure ofChrist smiling and giving the 'thumbs up'. The crowd buzzes.                                   GLICKSee? Isn't this better? How could you not feel just great walking into achurch and seeing this behind the priest - a positive reinforcement thatwhatever we do, God thinks is 'a~kay'. I love this thing, it's so...                                REPORTER I(interupting)Cardinal Glick - has the church given any thought to it's position on johnDoe Jersey?

BETHANYSome things never change.                                   RUFUS...and He'd just sit there listening and smiling. We'd ask Him why He neverjoined in the convo, but He said He just liked to hear us talk; aboutanything. Said it was like music. I think He just wished He had unimportantshit to talk about himself.                                  BETHANYHow does He feel now?                                   RUFUSHe still digs humanity, but it bothers Him to see the shit that getscarried out in His name - wars, bigotry, but especially the factioning ofall the religions. He said humanity took a good idea and, like always,built a belief structure on it.                                  BETHANYHaving beliefs isn't good?                                   RUFUSI think it's better to have ideas. You can change an idea. Changing abelief is trickier. Life should malleable and progressive; working fromidea to idea permits that. Beliefs anchor you to certain points and limitgrowth; new ideas can't generate. Life becomes stagnant. That was one thingthe Man hated - still life. He wanted everyone to be as enthralled withliving as He was. Maybe it hadsomething to do with knowing when He was going to die. but Christ had thisvitality that I've never encountered in another person since. You know whatI'm saving?                                  BETHANYHe was big on life?                                   RUFUSIt was more than that. He was the only person I ever knew who never engagedin that most ancient of life-affirming activities.                                  BETHANYSex.                                   RUFUSDebate. That's the only way people know how to reaffirm that they're alive- by debating. In all it's forms. People spend their whole lives debating:we fight about who's right and who's wrong, we fight ourselves, we fighteach other, we fight death, we fight over beliefs, we fight over fights. Webelieve that to stop debating - in any fashion -is to stop living and giveup. People say that life's a struggle, but it's not. Life is living. I'meven guilty of it myself, the way I go on about Christ's ethnicity,fighting for the truth to come out. And I'm dead. Even in death, the onlyway I know how to live is through debate. That's sad, isn't it?                                 BETIIANYNot if you believe it's important for people to know.                                   RUFUSA belief's a dangerous thing, Bethany. People die for it. People kill forit. The whole of existence is in jeopardy right now because of the CatholicBelief structure regarding this plenary indulgence bullshit. And whetherthey know it or not, Bartleby and Loki are exploiting that belief, and ifthey're successful, you, me. all of this... ends in a heartbeat.(beat)All over a belief.Bethany nods. Rufus looks around.                                   RUFUSI haven't seen the moron twins in awhile.

More or less.                                  BETHANYIt's terrible, isn't it? Don't you constantly question your value - likewhy was I so easy to cast aside? Didn't I have merit?                                 BARTLEBYAnd you wonder if the other party's going to come to their senses and callyou back.

Now theEmpire is led by whom? Darth Vader? No. It's led by the Emperor. And theEmperor is a practitioner of the Force, albeit the Dark Side of the Force.And the Force is basically a religion.(Silent Bob nods)So the entire galaxy is under Imperial rule, and the Imperial government isrun by this old religion. What you have, then, is a theocratic government -a government run by the church. So Luke, Han, and Leia are fighting thatgovernment to liberate the galaxy from the pious grip of what is, inessence, holy mother church.Silent Bob nods in understanding.Bethany and Bartleby slump in their booth, the table loaded with emptyglasses. Bethany is quite tipsy. Bartleby sips his drinks, andsurreptitiously spits it out.                                 BARTLEBYYou're saying you still go to church?

BARTLEBYWhen do you think you lost your faith?                                  BETHANYI remember the exact moment. I was on the phone with my mother, and she wastrying to counsel me through what was happening to me and my marriage. Andshe said something like "There's always a plan." And I... just got soangry. I mean, I know she was talking about God, right - God had a plan.But I was like "What about my plans?" You know? Like, don't they count foranything? I had planned to grow old with my husband and have a family -wasn't that plan good enough for God?(beat)Apparently not.(swigs her drink)How about you? When did you lose your faith?                                 BARTLEBYMe? Years ago. One day, God just stopped listening. I kept talking, but Igot the distinct impression that He wasn't listening anymore.                                  BETHANYShe. And how do you know She was listening in the first place?                                 BARTLEBY(thinks)I guess I don't.                                  BETHANYI hate thoughts like that. But they occur to you with age. When you're akid, you never question the whole faith thing - God's in Heaven, andHe's... She's always got her eye on you. I'd give anything to feel that wayagain. Which is why I guess I let myself get talked into this pilgrimage. Ineeded proof. And the opportunity presented itself to find out if it islike they told us in Catholic school. And I gotta tell you - the last fewdays, I've come across some interesting people that lend toward convincingme.

LOKI(beat)Get what?                                 BARTLEBYIn the beginning, it was just us and Him. Angels and God. And then Hecreated the humans. And He gave them more than He ever gave us. Our's wasdesigned to be a life of servitude and worship - adoration. But He gave thehumans more - He gave them a choice. They can choose to ignore God, chooseto acknowledge Him. All this time we've been down here, everyday I felt theabsence of the Divine presence. And it pained me... as I'm sure it musthave pained you sometimes, even though you'd gloss over it with jokes. Butwe feel his absence, and why? Because of the way He made us -as servants.Had we been given free will, we could ignore the pain... like them.

They weregiven paradise; they threw it away. They were given this planet; theydestroyed it. They were favored best among all His endeavors; and some ofthem don't even believe He exists. Their ego-mania corroded Hell and madeit dark and crimson.(looks at Loki)I asked you to lay down your sword years ago - why?Because I felt sorry for them. And where did it get us?Thrown out.(smiles)We've paid our debt. Don't you think it's time we went home?

Scion or not, she's just a human. And regardless, oursins are forgiven by passing through that arch. No harm, no foul.

Itis lowered to reveal Jay, Bethany, and Rufus sitting around a makeshiftfire in the middle of nowhere. Jay rolls a joint. Silent Bob reads thepaper.                                  BETHANYI don't understand why we couldn't stay on the train. You threw those guysoff.                                   RUFUSA very basic strategy - if your enemies know where you are, then don't bethere.                                  BETHANYAnd what's with that? Why are we enemies? The guy almost gutted me, forGod's sake!                                    JAYHe had the knife at your throat. To gut you, he'd have to have the knife atyour stomach.                                  BETHANYSemantics! Semantics that don't even answer mv question.                                   RUFUSWell, I know I'd perceive the person sent to kill me as my enemy.                                  BETHANYWhat do you mean, kill? I wasn't asked to kill them -just stop them fromgoing into that church.                                   RUFUSAnd how were you going to do that? Preoccupy them with a game of Bingo?                                  BETHANYI've never killed anything before in my life!                                    JAYI'll do it.                                   RUFUSShut the fuck up, little man - you couldn't kill a pint of ice cream, letalone an angel.                                    JAYFuck you - I can kill an angel as good as the next guy.                                   RUFUSOh yeah? How' would you do it?                                    JAYI'd give him a Van Damme neck-break, like in 'Hard Target'. D'jou see thatflick?                                   RUFUS(ignoring jay; to Bethany)Killing an angel's a two-step process - first you have to cut off theirwings. which then makes them human. From that point on, it's the same askilling anything else - head or heart, take your pick.                                  BETHANYYou say it as if it's easy.                                   RUFUS(oblivious to Jay)Problem is, I don't think we could pull it off even if we wanted to. Allthis time away from the Divine Presence should have made those two weaker -and those guys felt far from weak. Either that or someone's protecting them- someone with juice.                                  BETHANYSo then we're screwed?(shrugs)Shit, that's the best news l've heard in days.                                   RUFUSThis doesn't excuse you from tryng to stop them.                                  BETHANYCount me out. You're telling me they're unstopable, I'm exhausted - bothpsychologically and physically, the odds are against us. I say we kick backand wait for the end -a little non~xistence might be just what the doctorordered.                                    JAYI'm with her. I don't care about dying, so long as we're all going to die.                                   RUFUSWhat are you babbling about now?                                    JAYIf I was the only one, that'd bother me because every-one else would go onliving, having a good time without me. But if we all go at once, that'd beokay, because I know I'm not missing anything.                                  BETHANYSee? You know it's right when even he's making sense.                                    JAYBesides, she said if we were in a situation where we were going to die inlike five minutes, she'd have sex with me and Silent Bob.                                   RUFUSSo you're suggesting she throw in the towel and let eons of work andhistory get blinked out of existence just so you can get laid?                                    JAY(thinks)No. Just so me and Silent Bob could get laid.                                  BETHANYNow that we're all but in total agreement on this, I'd just like to finallyknow - why me?                                    JAYBecause you've got nice tits.                                  BETHANYI wasn't talking to you!(to Rufus)Why me? Why do I have to do this? Nobody's comeclean on that. Out of everyone on the whole god-damned planet. How come Igot tapped?Rufus looks at her. He shrugs.                                   RUFUSFamily ties.                                    JAYThat show's funny as hell.                                   RUFUSShut up.(to Bethany)Do you know what the Apocryphal books are?Bethany shakes her head no.                                   RUFUSMost of that information in the Bible came from the Dead Sea Scrolls -ancient text discovered in a cave ages ago. And when the Sanskrit wastranslated, they discovered data that conflicted with the lore churchofficials had already established as the basis of their religion. Theycouldn't refute centuries of dogma, so they thought it best to leavecertain passages out - sometimes whole books. Those books make up theApocrypha.                                  BETHANYWhat's this have to do with me?                                   RUFUSYou've never gotten the complete picture. If they had compiled the materialtogether like they were supposed to, you'd get the whole story. But byleaving text out, the church has presented you people with an extremelysterile and unmoving account of religious history. The Creation. the entireOld Testament, the history of Christ...(let's her take it in)Forget about my whole black angle for a minute...                                    JAYWe might if you'd quit bringing it up.Rufus backhands Jay. Silent Bob holds jay back. Rufus continues, oblivousto Jay.                                   RUFUSHe goes from twelve years old to thirty. Whole volumes of text about theeighteen year struggle with His Divine nature prior to His acceptance of itwere thown out, forever lost to the faithful.                                  BETHANYI don't buy it. Integral material like that would give people a betterunderstanding of the nature of God. Why leave it out?                                   RUFUSBecause it was all closely tied in with His family.                                  BETHANYHis mother and father?                                   RUFUSHis brothers and sisters.                                  BETHANY(beat)Wait, wait, wait - Jesus didn't have any brothers or sisters. Mary was avirgin - that's why it's called the Immaculate Conception.                                   RUFUSMary gave birth to Christ without having known a man's touch - that's true.But she did have a husband. And do you really think he'd have stayedmarried to her all those years if he wasn't getting laid? The nature of Godand the Virgin Birth - those are leaps of faith. But believing a wife neverhumped her husband - that's just gullibility.                                  BETHANY(sudden realization)MARY AND JOSEPH HAD SEX?!?                                   RUFUSAll the time, from what I understand. Jesus used to tell me stories abouthearing them through the walls when He was a kid.(beat)So you ask why you got tapped. I'll tell you why: a Christ was thesalvation of this world once before. And you're the closest thing to aChrist that still walks.                                  BETHANYMeaning?                                   RUFUSThe blood that flows in your veins shares a chromosome or two at thegenetic level with the man you call Jesus.(hand on her shoulder)You're His great-grand-niece.Bethany's jaw drops. A high-pitched squeak of a word escapes her lips.                                    JAY(takes a hit from his joint)So... that would make Bethany part black.(to Silent Bob)Man, this is just like when Vader told Luke he was his father.                                   RUFUSI just wish I knew what the hell we're supposed to do now?                                 OC VOICEYou must go to the Dagobah system and find Yoda - the Jedi Master whoinstructed me.Everyone turns around. Metatron leans against a tree.

JAYNow who's this mother fucker?                                   RUFUSThis is the Voice of God - show some respect.                                    JAYThe Voice of God? Where's the rest of Him?                                 METATRONFunny you should mention that - we're not sure.                                  BETHANYExcuse me?

RUFUSIf that's the case, then why was Bethany tapped?                                 METATRONYou know those constitutionals He likes to take?                                  BETHANYConstitutionals?                                   RUFUSI think we're beyond euphemisms at this point.(to Bethany)God's a skee-ball fanatic.                                 METATRONLet's not altogether blow some of the mystery that surrounds Him, alright?(to Bethany)Yes - the Lord has quite a fancy for the game; been playing it for years -He assumes a human form once a month and indulges. Doesn't tell anyonewhere He's playing; just goes away for a couple of hours. It's quiteunderstandable - a small exercise in hand/eye coordination has been provenas a highly effective means of therapeutic relaxation. And from what Iunderstand, He always gives his free points away to neighborhood children.Isn't that sweet?                                  BETHANYBut She hasn't come back from one of those day-trips, is what you'regetting at?                                 METATRON(to Rufus)'She'? I take it she's met the Muse.(to Bethany)No, 'She' hasn't. And we've been unable to locate Her.                                   RUFUSMaybe He was killed? Human form has that drawback.                                M ETAT RONNo - there's a different sort of foul-play afoot, children. Whomever hasset the renegade angels on their path and is keeping them quitewell-hidden. is also responsible for the Lord's whereabouts. Were He to bekilled in human form, He'd have immediately returned to Paradise. Somebodyknew enough to keep the body alive, but incapacitate Him in another fashion- He's trapped in a body.                                   RUFUSSo God's not dead...                                    JAYHe's brain dead.                                 METATRONSo it would seem. And as omnipotent as we are above, I have to admit thatwe're more or less lost without His presence. We've had our people lookingeverywhere for Him. And I tapped her, because I thought we might be able tosmoke out whoever's behind this. But whoever it is has been clever enoughto send some lackeys after you, as opposed to showing up themselves.                                   RUFUSCan it be Lucifer?                                 METATRONThankfully they seem oblivious to the situation in the nether-regions. Iknow they're not responsible - at least not Lucifer. If he was, he'd havemade his move by now to conquer Heaven. And I know he's not responsible forBartleby and Loki because he'd have just as much to lose by their return aseveryone else.

And why did you lie to me? You said I was tapped as atest?                                 METATRONNo, you said that - I just didn't correct you. You were shocked enough -how do you think you would've taken it if I told you the face of Godbelonged on the back of a milk carton?                                   RUFUSSo what do we do now?                                M ETAT RONI say we get drunk, kids - because I'm all out of ideas.

BETHANYLook, asshole - I don't know if anyone explained the rules to you, but ifyou succeed, everything gets blinked out of existence - even you.                                  AZRAEL(beat)Human, have you ever been to Hell? I think not. Do you know that once Hellwas nothing more than the absence of Cod? And if you'd ever been in Hispresence. then you'd realize that's punishment enough. But then your kindcame along - and made it so much worse.                                  BETHANYHumans aren't capable of one hundredth the evil a shitbag demon likeyourself is.                                  AZRAELEvil is an abstract; it's a human construct. But true to his irresponsiblenature. man won t own up to being the engineer of evil, so he blames hisdark deeds on my ilk. But his selfishness is limitless, and it's not enoughfor him to shadow his own existence. He turned Hell into a suffering Pitt -fire, wailing, darkness - the kind of place anyone would do anything to getout of. And why? Because he lacks the ability to forgive himself. It isbeyond your abilities to simply make recompense for and regret the sins youcommit. No - you choose rather to create a psychodrama and dwell in afoundless belief that God could never forgive your 'grievous offenses'. Soyou bring your guilt and inner-decay with you to Hell - where the horridimaginations of so many gluttons-for-punishment give birth to the sicknessthat has infected the abyss since the first one of your kind arrived there,begging to be 'punished'. And in doing so, they've transformed the cold andsolitude to pain and misery. I've spent eons privy to the flames, inhalingthe decay, hearing the wail of the damned. I know what effect such horrorshave on the delicate psyche of an angelic beihg.(beat)Would you like to glimpse pain eternal? Look...Azrael places his hand over Bethany's eyes. For about ten seconds, we seesome of the most fucked up and disturbing imagery that can be crammed into240 frames of film.Azrael pulls his hand away. Bethany is fried, convulsing uncontrolably.                                  AZRAELI'd rather not exist than go back to that. And if everyone has to go downwith me, so be it.                                SERENDIPITY(holding up Bethany)You're still thinking only about yourself, you fuckmg child.                                  AZRAELNow, now, now. Things are getting too tense in here. What say we watch alittle t.v.(grabs remote control)                                    JAYPut on channel nine - 'Davey and Goliath'!A Stygian Triplet smacks him with it's hockey stick.                                    JAYHey!                                  AZRAELI was thinking more along the lines of current events.On the T.V. - a sweaty and panicked REPORTER barks into the camera,obscuring the chaos behind him. Screams are heard.                                 REPORTER...I repeat - men with huge fucking wings have laid waste to St.Michael's... Bullets don't seem to affect them... police who were on thescene are dead... The remaining crowd has dropped to their knees,identifying this as the fabled Apocalypse.. I'm not a man of faith, but I'minclined to agree with them..(looking OC)NO! DON'T COME ANY CLOSER!!(pulls gun)PLEASE!! Please...He puts the gun in his mouth and fires. The screen goes blank.                                  AZRAEL(snapping off tv.)You see that? And I told them to keep a low profile. I'd be pissed, but ina couple of minutes, it won't matter anymore.While he speaks, Serendipity looks to Silent Bob. Silent Bob snaps toattention, and locks eyes with Serendipity. He looks to the golf club, thenback at her. He nods.Azrael suddenly catches the exchange between the two.                                  AZRAELNow what was that all about?                                SERENDIPITYHunhh? Oh. nothing. I had something in my eye.                                  AZRAEL(getting up)Bullshit. What are you trying to do, Serendipity -get the guy killed? Nowwho's the fucking child? What did you tell him - to hit me with the golfclub? Are you serious?(picks up golf club)I'm a fucking demon, and you'd have him assault me with athletic equipment?(hands club to Silent Bob)Well, here then - take it. Call it a gift.(stands back and hits his own chest)Take a shot - take your best shot. C'mon - c'mon, bright boy.The Stygian Triplets snicker. Silent Bob stares at Azrael, perplexed.                                  AZRAELDon't you know anything?Silent Bob looks to Serendipity. She nods. He shrugs and swings the clubwith all his might into Azrael's chest - which caves in, blowing muck andshit everywhere.Rufus, Jay, and Serendipity turn on their captors, grabbing the StygianTriplets by the throats.

SERENDIPITYDO IT!Bethany leaps over the bar, pushing over the dead bartender, and blessesthe melting-ice filled sink. Serendipity urges Rufus and Jay to follow her,with the Triplets in hand. They submerge them - head first - in the sink.Cruddy steam and muck blows out of the water. The Triplets convulse andfall still.Azrael clutches at his sucking chest wound, dropping to his knees. He grabsSilent Bob's leg. Silent Bob kicks him onto his back and out cold.                                    JAY(joining Silent Bob)What the fuck have you been eating?Silent Bob shrugs.                                  BETHANYWhat just happened?                                SERENDIPITY(collecting hockey sticks)He said it himself - he's a demon. You hit a demon with an instrument ofGod - the pure side's always going to do the most damage.                                    JAYSilent Bob's an instrument of God?!                                SERENDIPITYNo - but the driver is.                                  BETHANY(catching on)And Glick's the kind of asshole that would bless his own clubs for a bettergame.

JAYWe gonna make it?                                   RUFUSWas Jesus down?Rufus and Jay exit. Silent Bob stares down at Azrael's body. Jay comes backand yanks him out the door.EXT STREET - DAYCardinal Click runs to a pay phone.

Just wait for a solution tofall out of the sky?!On cue, a body plummets out of the sky and hits the ground before thegroup, quite like Rufus had, way back at the start.

OC LOKIWe ran out of parishoners, so he just started picking up anyone off thestreet. You're looking at eons of repression getting purged.
