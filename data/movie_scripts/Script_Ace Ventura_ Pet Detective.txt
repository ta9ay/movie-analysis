ACE VENTURAPET DETECTIVE

Written byJack BernsteinTom ShadyacJim Carrey

EXT. STREET - DAY

A UPS Man with a big pot belly is walking down the street, whistling and carelessly tossing a package in the air. We hear the sound of broken glass in the box. He passes a professional woman.

UPS MAN 
Good morning, UPS!

He tosses the box behind his back like a basketball, then acknowledges another passerby.

UPS MAN 
UPS, good to see you!

He takes a couple of steps, then flings the package incredibly high into the air, spins completely around and expertly drops to one knee and catches the box. A Hispanic man passes.

UPS MAN 
Buenos dias. Uo Pay eSsay.

EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

The UPS Man dodges a couple of black kids as though playing basketball. He runs up the front steps of the building. He reaches out to open the front door and inadvertently flings the package behind him and back down the steps.

He goes back, retrieves the package, then enters the building.

INT. LOBBY - DAY

Several people stand in the elevator. The UPS Man just makes it, but the door closes on the package... REPEATEDLY. He feigns embarrassment.

INT. 3RD FLOOR - DAY

ELEVATOR DOORS OPEN. The UPS Man throws the package out onto the floor and starts kicking it down the hall like a soccer player. With one last big kick the parcel lands in front of APARTMENT 3B. He picks it up and knocks on the door.

We hear a small dog barking.

GRUFF MAN (O.S.) 
Shut the hell up, you stupid mutt!

An angry, burly man pokes his nose hairs out the chained door.

GRUFF MAN 
What do you want?

UPS MAN 
UPS, sir. And how are you thisafternoon? Alrighty then!

The man grumpily unchains the door. He's a big guy - 6'5", 250, and 50 of that is chest hair. A small Shiatsu stands beside him.

UPS MAN 
I have a package for you.

The UPS guy thrusts the package toward the man. We can clearly hear broken glass inside. The man takes the package.

GRUFF MAN 
It sounds broken.

UPS MAN 
Most likely sir! I bet it wassomething nice though! Now... Ihaver an insurance form. If you'lljust sign here, here, and here,and initial here, and print your namehere, we'll get the rest of theforms out to you as soon as wecan.

The man begrudgingly begins to fill out the form. The dog wags his tail and whines. We can see that he likes the UPS guy.

UPS MAN 
That's a lovely dog you have. Doyou mind if I pet him, sir?

GRUFF MAN
(mumbles) 
I don't give a rat's ass.

The UPS Man bends down and talks to the dog in a really sucky pet talk.

UPS MAN 
Oo ja boo ba da boo boo do booo!

GRUFF MAN
(under breath) 
Brother.

Before the Gruff Man can finish, the UPS Man stands back up and takes the form again.

UPS MAN 
That's fine sir. I can fill outthe rest. You just have yourselfa good day. Take care, now! 'Bye'bye, then!

THRASH MUSIC STARTS

INT. HALLWAY -- CONT'D

The UPS Man moves swiftly down the hall and into the stair well.

INT. APARTMENT 3B - CONT'D

The Gruff Man shakes the box, tosses it down and sits in front of the TV.

EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - CONT'D

The UPS Man bursts from the front door and hustles down the street very quickly. He passes several people.

UPS MAN
(quickly) 
UPS, S'cuse me. UPS, comin'through.

INT. APARTMENT 3B - CONT'D

We see the back of the Shiatsu staring at the crack in the front door. He has not moved an inch. The Gruff Man looks over.

GRUFF MAN 
Hey, stupid! Get away from thedoor!

The dog doesn't budge and this really pisses him off. He gets up and heads for the dog.

GRUFF MAN 
What's the matter with you, I saidGIT!!!

He roughly picks the dog up by the scruff of the neck, but as he turns it around we see that it is a stuffed dog. Around it's neck is a business card that reads, "You have been had by Ace Ventura - Pet Detective." He breathes fire.

GRUFF MAN 
Son of a bitch!

He smashes the dog to the ground.

EXT. ALLEY - CONT'D

As the UPS Man/Ace rounds the corner, his shirt opens up at his pot belly and the Shiatsu's head sticks out. Ace is gloating.

ACE
(announcer's voice) 
That was a close one, ladies andgentlemen. Unfortunately, inevery contest, there must be...A LOOSER!

He jumps into an old beat-up Chevy Bel Air, and lets the dog out onto the passenger seat.

ACE (CONT'D) 
LOOOHOOOSERRRHERRR!

He then pulls open the car's ashtray, and to the dog's delight, it's filled with puppy chow.

He tries to start the engine but it won't turn over. The dog shoots him a look.

ACE
(to dog) 
No problem, it gets flooded.We'll just wait a few seconds.

Ace sits back. SMASH!!!

From Ace's POV we see a Baseball bat shatter the front windshield.

ACE 
Or, we could try it now.

Ace frantically tries to start the car. His new friend continues around the car beating the living shit out of it.

ACE 
Oooh, boy.

ACE'S POV

We see the creep wailing on the car in Ace's side view mirror.

ACE 
Warning! Assholes are closer thanthey appear!

The dog is barking insanely.

ACE
(to dog) 
You think you can do better?!

The baseball bat is now pummeling the trunk.

ACE 
Wanna give me a push while you'reback there?

BOOM! The back window shatters. Then the car's engine roars to life. Ace rejoices.

ACE 
FARFEGNUGENNNNN!!!

Ace leaves the bad guy in a cloud of dust and gravel, screaming bloody murder.

EXT. MIAMI CITY STREETS - DAY

Ace and his new pal speed away freely.

Close on the happy dog, hanging his head out the car window. PAN across the broken windshield to Ace, also hanging his head out the window to see where he's going.

The car drives by a sign on a telephone pole: "Reward" -- with a picture of the Shiatsu in Ace's seat.

THRASH MUSIC ENDS

INT. HOUSE - DAY

A very sexy woman is hugging and kissing the Shiatsu.

WOMAN 
My little baby. You missed mommydidn't you? Did daddy hurt you?I won't let him, no I won't. Hemay have kept the big screen TV,but he's not gonna keep my baby.No he isn't.
(very sexy to Ace) 
Thank you, Mr. Ventura. How can Iever repay you?

She slinks over to Ace and puts her arms around his neck.

ACE 
Well, the reward would be good,and there was some damage to my –

She cuts Ace off with a devastating kiss.

WOMAN 
Would you like me to take youpants off instead?

ACE 
Ummmm… Sure.

She pulls him toward the bedroom.

WOMAN 
It takes a big man to stand up tomy husband. He's already put twoof my lovers in the hospital.

ACE 
How did he find out? Does he haveyou followed.

WOMAN 
No… I tell him

She plants a kiss on Ace's neck and pulls him down out of frame onto the bed.

EXT. DOLPHIN STADIUM PLAYING FIELD - DAY

The stands are empty, but there's plenty happening on the field. The Miami Dolphins are practicing. Dan Marino is in top form, hitting pass after pass.

Behind one of the goal posts, the team's mascot, a rare dolphin (SNOWFLAKE), wearing #4, is practicing his routine. The Trainer is dressed like a quarterback.

TRAINERBlue! 42! Blue! 42! Hut! Hut!

Snowflake swims over, snatches a small football out of the Trainer's hand, and does an end zone dance on his tail. He then returns the ball to the trainer.

The Trainer now sets the ball on the dolphin's tail and snowflake "kicks" a perfect field goal. The Trainer blows a whistle and raises both arms.

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. DOLPHIN STADIUM PLAYING FIELD - NIGHT

The stadium is now completely empty. Snowflake peacefully swims around his tank.

Suddenly, the water is illuminated by the headlights of an n.d. panel truck.

The rear door slides open. Two men jump out in wet suits.

They slip into the water while a third waits outside the tank.

Snowflake surfaces to check out the action. One of the men holds out a fish. Snowflake eagerly takes it, then shudders as a large syringe is stuck into his back. Snowflake thrashes around.

Quick cut of a hand with the blur of a ring slamming against the tank. But the needle has done its job. Snowflake quickly goes limp.

Snowflake is loaded into the back of the truck. Move in on Snowflake's face. His excited cackle has turned into a painful whimper.

The truck skids away passing the guard gate. The guard is hog tied and gagged, struggling to free himself.

INT. ADELLE'S FRIENDLY PET SHOP - NEXT DAY

Close up on a dead goldfish laying on a newspaper. We pull back to reveal ADELLE ROSENBERG, the seventy year old owner of a cluttered pet shop. She's handing a live goldfish in a bag to JENNIFER, a very sweet nine year old.

ADELLE 
Here you go, honey. Nowremember… this kind of fishdoesn't like it in the freezer.

JENNY 
But what's gonna happen to Dolly?

ADELLE 
Don't worry, I'll make sure shegets a proper burial.

Jennifer exits. Adelle calls to her cat, and tosses it the goldfish. The cat catches it in mid-air.

ADELLE 
Rest in peace.

Ace enters the pet shop. It looks like he slept in his clothes.

ADELLE 
Well… here comes another deadfish.

ACE 
Hi, beautiful. What time do youget off?

ADELLE 
Uh oh.

ACE
(suggestively) 
I've heard some pretty greatthings about your kibble.

ADELLE 
Well, I hope I'm not getting areputation.

ACE
(switching to mock anger) 
Just get me the food!

She chuckles at Ace as she loads a couple of bags with different kinds of pet food.

ADELLE 
So… ahh, when can I expect youto pay your tab?

ACE 
I'm a little bit Sli Pickins,right now, I'm a little TightSqueeze Louise, a little WelfareWolly, Potless Pissing Pete, I'mah –

ADELLE 
If you were a horse I'd shoot ya'.Just take it.

ACE 
Gravy! I'm good for it, Adelle.I'm on a very big case right now.

Ace reaches into his coat pocket and pulls out a flyer with a picture of a white pigeon.

ACE 
See this pigeon? It's a truealbino. Some rich guy lost it.He's offering a ten thousanddollar reward.

ADELLE 
Wow, albino pigeons are veryrare. How are you going to findhim?

ACE 
Just keep my eyes open, and hopeto god it doesn't snow.

Ace grabs his bags and heads for the door.

ADELLE 
You're a good boy, Ace. A goodboy.

He holds the door open for an elderly gentleman who is entering at the same time. The gentleman is walking a toy poodle on a leash. The poodle is dragging its butt along the entire length of the floor. Ace and Adelle just stare.

ELDERLY MAN
(in a loud voice) 
Do you have anything for ringworm?

EXT. SURFSIDE APARTMENT COMPLEX - DAY

Ace enters the courtyard of a two story U-shaped apartment complex carrying his groceries. It's a crappy joint but he calls it home. Inside an open apartment on the ground floor, the landlord, MR. SHICKADANCE, sits watching TV, stuffing his face with cheese doodles. Ace sneaks past the door and up the stairs.

EXT. SECOND FLOOR - DAY

Ace is just putting the key in the door when the landlord steps up behind him. Ace is startled by the dreaded 'Shickadance Rasp' (not unlike Linda Blair in THE EXORCIST).

LANDLORD 
Venturaaaaa?

Ace straightens up, but doesn't turn around.

ACE 
Yes, Satan?

Now Ace turns around in mock surprise.

ACE 
Oh, I'm sorry, sir. You soundedlike someone else.

LANDLORD 
Never mind the wise cracksVenturaaa. You owe me rent!

ACE 
Mr. Shickadance… I told you,you're my first priority! As soonas I find the white pigeon,you're paid!!

LANDLORD 
I heard animals in there Ventura!I heard 'em again this morning,scratchin' around.

ACE 
I never bring my work home withme, sir.

The landlord notices the bags of kibble.

LANDLORD 
Oh, yeah? What's all this petfood for?

ACE
(beat) 
Fiber.

The landlord isn't buying it.

ACE 
You wanna take a look foryourself? Go head.

Ace rattles his keys in the door. Then he swings it open and turns on the light. The house is clear. Ace walks in as the landlord stands there snooping and sniffing the air.

ACE 
Well… are you satisfied?

LANDLORD
(still suspicious) 
Yeah, but don't ever let me catchyou with an animal in there,that's all!

ACE 
Okay then. Take care now. 'Bye'bye.

The landlord walks away as Ace closes the door.

ACE
(quietly to himself) 
LLOOSER.

He then turns to the room and gives a distinct whistle.

CHAOS ENSUES! Animals jump out from every direction. Lizards crawl out of drawers, birds fly through the air, all of them gravitating to Ace.

ACE
(to his flock) 
Ooshhooboobooboodoodoo!

INT. MIAMI DOLPHIN HEADQUARTERS - LATER THAT DAY

The very imposing office of BOBBY RIDDLE, owner of the Miami Dolphins. Riddle, 70, is a take charge, doesn't take crap from anyone type of guy. He is yelling at ROGER PODACTER, an ex-linebacker in his early sixties, and MELISSA ROBINSON, Podacter's attractive assistant.

RIDDLE 
I just want to know one thing; Howthe hell do you lose a 500 poundfish?!

Melissa's about to speak but hesitates.

RIDDLE (CONT.) 
What?

MELISSA 
It's not a fish, sir. It's amammal.

An angry Riddle stands up.

RIDDLE 
Oh, thank you very much, Mrs.Jacque Cousteau!

PODACTER 
Bob, she didn't mean anything byit.

RIDDLE calms down a little, and sits.

RIDDLE
(calmer) 
Listen, personally, I don't give agood god damn about a fish.

He looks at Melissa. She doesn't dare say anything.

RIDDLE (CONT.) 
All I care about is winning thisSuper Bowl! I want the players'head in the right place. Shit,Roger, you've been in this gamelong enough, you know howsuperstitious players are. Ourquarterback's been putting hissocks on backwards since highschool. And I got a lineman whohasn't washed his jock in twoyears because he thinks flies arelucky! I want that god damn fishon the field Super Bowl Sunday!FIND THE FISH, OR FIND NEW JOBS!

INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS ACTION

An upset Podacter and Melissa walk through the hallway.

PODACTER 
Why did it have to happen now? Igot three stinking years left tillretirement.

MELISSA 
I've got forty.

PODACTER 
I'll tell you who did it. It wasthose goddamn animal rights nuts!Always out there with theirgoddamn signs, ANIMALS WERE BORNFREE, STOP TORTURING SNOWFLAKE!That goddamn fish lives better thanthey do!

They stop outside Melissa's office by her secretary's desk.

MELISSA 
The police are checking into theanimal rights people.
(to secretary) 
Martha, have the police calledback about the dolphin yet?

MARTHA 
No, but I wanted to tell you, whenI lost my Cuddles, I hired a petdetective.

PODACTER 
A what?

MARTHA 
A pet detective.

MELISSA 
Thanks Martha, but we'd betterleave this to professionals.

MARTHA 
Well actually, he was quite good.Pet detection is a very involved,highly scientific process.

CUT TO:

EXT. ROOF OF HOUSE - SAME TIME

CLOSE ON ACE - COOING like a pigeon. Widen to reveal, Ace precariously perched on the roof of a two story building. He is four feet away from "The" pigeon. Ater a beat, he makes a mad, spastic, yet scientific, lunge for the bird.

ACE 
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!

The bird makes a clean getaway. Unable to stop his momentum, Ace flies past the edge of the building and slides down the side of the roof.

EXT. GROUND - CONTINUOUS ACTION

BAM!!! Ace crashes to the ground. As he lies face down, in a heap of trash, his beeper goes off.

EXT. DOLPHIN HEADQUARTERS/BOBBY RIDDLE STADIUM - DAY

Parking lot. Ace's clunker drives by some real nice cars. Employees stare at him.

INT. SECURITY CHECK POINT - DAY

A stern guard is admitting people into the stadium. He scans each one with a security detection wand.

MAN #1 
Art Wheeler. Sporting supplies.

The guard scans him. He goes.

MAN #2 
Tom Anderson. Concessions.

The guard scans him. He goes.

ACE 
Ace Ventura. Pet detective.

The guard stares at Ace, accusingly.

INT. MELISSA'S OFFICE - DAY

Martha enters.

MARTHA 
Ah… Mr. Ventura to see you.

MELISSA 
Okay, send him in.

Martha exits, Ace enters.

MELISSA (CONT'D) 
Hi, I'm Melissa Robinson. Did youhave any trouble getting in?

ACE 
No, the guy with the rubber glovewas surprisingly gentle.

MELISSA
(apologetically) 
Super Bowl week. Security'stight. Mr. Ventura, I'll getright to the point…

She slips a tape in the VCR and gestures for Ace to sit.

MELISSA 
Our mascot was stolen from histank last night. Are you familiarwith Snowflake?

The tape shows Snowflake doing a trick. The trainer, dressed like a quarterback, shouts out signals.

TRAINER (ON TAPE)Blue! 42! Blue! 42! Hut! Hut!

Snowflake swims over, snatches the small football out of the trainer's hand, swims the length of the pool, does an end zone dance on his tail, then returns the ball to the trainer.

MELISSA (O.S.) 
We got Snowflake from the MiamiSeaquarium. He's a rare BottleNose Dolphin. That's the newtrick he was going to do duringthe half-time show.

While Ace studies the tape, he chews sunflower seeds in a bird-like fashion, placing the shells in a neat little pile on her desk.

MELISSA 
Would you like an ashtray?

ACE 
No, I don't smoke.

He adds more shells to the pile.

Melissa is already wondering if she has made a mistake.

MELISSA 
To be honest, Mr. Ventura.I'm pretty skeptical. Beforetoday, I didn't even know therewas such a thing as a petdetective.

ACE 
Well, now that you do, you'll knowwho to call if your Schnauser everruns away.

MELISSA 
How did you know I have aSchnauser?

Ace pulls a, invisible-to-the-naked-eye dog hair off here blouse and presents it to her.

ACE 
He's young, about five pounds,black coat, white speckles…
(sniffs the hair) 
…likes to chase cars.

MELISSA 
Very impressive.

ACE 
You should see what I can do witha good stool sample.

MELISSA 
I can hardly wait. Look, we'vegot a problem. Can you help me ornot?

ACE
(coy) 
Well, sea faring creatures aren'treally my expertise…

MELISSA 
We'll give you three thousanddollars on delivery.

Ace immediately becomes the narrator of a nature show.

ACE 
The dolphin is a social creature.Capable of complex communication.Traveling in large groups orschools…

EXT. PLAYING FIELD - A SHORT TIME LATER

The Dolphin players practice. A crowd of reporters interview Marino.

MARINO 
We just choked in 82. We had achance to win it and we didn't.Nobody's gonna choke this time,and if they do, I'll kill 'em.

Ace and Melissa head for Snowflake's tank.

MELISSA 
The police were here this morning.Apparently, the kidnappers usedthe back gate.

Ace bends down to look at some tire tracks on the field.

MELISSA (CONT'D) 
They said some kind of a –

ACE 
Four wheel drive van… loaded fromthe rear.

Ace sniffs the turf. Podacter enters nervously.

MELISSA 
Oh, hi, Roger. How are you holdingup?

PODACTER 
Well if it looks like I'm walkingfunny it's because I have a bunchon reporters up my ass. They'vebeen asking me about Snowflake allday. Who's this?

MELISSA 
Roger Podacter, meet Ace Ventura.Ace is our pet detective.

Podacter shakes his hand.

PODACTER 
Nice to meet you. Martha Metzrecommended you very highly.

ACE 
Martha Metz? Martha Metz. Ohyeah, the bitch.

PODACTER 
What?

ACE 
Pekinese. Hyperactive. Lost inHighland Park area. She was halfdead when I found her. Is thatthe tank?

They both follow Ace as he makes a B-line.

EXT. SNOWFLAKE'S TANK - MOMENTS LATER

The tank is empty.

ACE 
Cops drain it?

MELISSA 
Yes. This morning.

Ace hops on the ladder.

ACE 
If I'm not back in fiveminutes… call Lloyd Bridges.

INT. DOLPHIN TANK - MOMENTS LATER

While eating sunflower seeds, Ace meticulously examines the tank, including the scratches where the hand banged up against the wall when Snowflake was stolen. All the while, he is singing a bastardized version of the theme from, "Flipper."

ACE 
…Wonderful Flipper… gloriousFlipper… magnificentFlipper… The flippiest Flipper…

Podacter and Melissa, watching from the rim, look at each other like, "What have we gotten ourselves into?" Podacter spots something.

PODACTER 
Oh, great.

A hoard or reporters are headed their way.

PODACTER (CONT) 
I'll try to head them off.

MELISSA
(to Ace) 
Get out of the tank.

ACE
(still singing) 
…Can't hear you Flipper,Flipper… Lookin' for Flipper,gotta find Flipper…

MELISSA 
I said, get out of the tank! Now!

The reporters draw closer. Podacter heads them off.

REPORTER 
So where's Snowflake?

PODACTER 
Ah… Snowflake is just, ah, notavailable right now.

REPORTER 
Come on, I'm supposed to get ashot of his new trick for theevening news.

REPORTER #2 
What? Is he sick?

Other reporters chime in.

VARIOUS REPORTERSDid something happen toSnowflake?! What're youhiding..?!

Melissa and Podacter don't know what to say. Then, a strange voice is heard.

ACE/HEINZ (O.S.)
(unrecognizable accent) 
How cun I be getting dis vork dunmit all da shouting? What for isdis shouting?

REPORTER 
Who the hell is that?

MELISSA 
That? That's…

ACE/HEINZ 
Heinz Kissvelvet. I am Trainer ofDolphins. You vant to talk to zedolphin, you talk to me!

REPORTER 
What happened to the regulartrainer?

ACE/HEINZ 
Vy do you care about the dolphin?Do you know him? Does he call youat home? Do you have a dorsalfin?
(beat) 
To train ze dolphin, you must zinklike ze dolphin. You must begetting oonside ze dolphin's head!Just yesterday I'm askingSnowflake… "ee, eee, eee." Hesaid, "Eee, eee, eee, eee." Undyou can quote him.

Ace spits at the reporters' feet. Podacter jumps in.

PODACTER 
Gentlemen, please, Coach Shula'spress conference is just about tobegin. Why don't I take you overthere and let, ah, Heinz, do hisjob.

He ushers the press away.

MELISSA
(sotto to Ace) 
Are you finished, Heinz?

ACE 
Not yet.

Ace goes to the filter outside the tank, opens it, and pours out its contents – mainly leaves, small twigs and gunk. He roots through it, notices a very tiny amber stone. He smiles to himself.

ACE 
Now I'm finished.

EXT. METRO POLICE DEPARTMENT - LATER THAT DAY

A flurry of activity in the detective division. As Ace enters, several cops taunt him on sight, led by the obnoxious, SERGEANT AGUADO.

AGUADO 
Hey, Ventura! Make any goodcollars lately?

ANOTHER COPOr were they leashes?

They all bust up. Aguado spots a bug on the ground.

AGUADO 
Uh oh.
(steps on the bug) 
Homicide, Ventura!

The cops are falling all over themselves laughing.

AGUADO 
How you gonna solve this one?!

Ace walks up to them and looks at the squashed bug.

ACE 
Good question, Aguado… first I'destablish a motive. In this casethe killer saw the size of thebug's dick, and became insanelyjealous.

The other cops all react with a big "ooooooo". Aguado has no comeback. Ace comes face to face with him.

ACE 
Then I'd lose thirty poundsporking his wife.

Aguado suddenly loses it and swings at Ace.

With a lightening move, Ace sidesteps the punch and forces Aguado's face down next to the dead bug.

ACE 
Now kiss and make up.

Ace walks off.

ACE
(to himself) 
LLLOOOSER!

Ace walks to the desk of EMILIO ECHAVEZ, a young energetic member of the homicide division. Ace has a silly impish look on his face.

ACE
(playfully) 
I miss you.

EMILIO 
It's not a good time, Ace. IfEinhorn sees me talking to you I'mgonna be history.

ACE 
Okay. Just tell me what you goton Snowflake. That's all I need.

EMILIO 
…I can't say anything. My handsare tied.

ACE
(effeminate)

Sounds like my kind of a party.

A cop comes to Emilio's desk.

COP

Look alive, Einhorn's on her waydown.

EMILIO 
Ace, please?!

ACE 
Just tell me who's working thecase?

EMILIO 
Aguado.

ACE 
Aguado?! He's pimple juice! He'sthe poster child for lead paintchip eaters!

EMILIO 
Look, Ace. We're a little busywith murderers and drug dealers.A missing dolphin isn't exactly ahigh priority.

The elevator is getting closer.

EMILIO 
Ace, gimme a break will ya?

Ace nonchalantly sits back in a chair, pops a sunflower seed into his mouth and cracks it loudly.

EMILIO
(quickly) 
Okay, okay. We checked all thelocal animal rights groups,taxidermists, and we're running acheck through DMV on all recentvan rentals. So far, nada.

ACE 
Any unusual bets being made?

EMILIO 
Ace, it's the Super Bowl, ofcourse there's bets being made.

ACE 
What'd you find out about thetank?

EMILIO 
Nothing weird. Just the tiretracks and the exit route. Theguard didn't see anything.

ACE 
That's it?

EMILIO 
That's it. I swear. Now pleasego away!

ACE 
You know something?
(again impish) 
YOU'RE NICE!

Ace gets up and exits the room. Then just as Emilio sighs with relief, Ace pops back in.

ACE 
What about crazy Philly fans?

The elevator bell rings. Out steps police LT. LOIS EINHORN, mid 30s, with a slender build, a great pair of legs and a bad tude.

ACE 
Holy Testicle Tuesday!

EINHORN
(to Emilio) 
What the hell is he doing here?

ACE 
I came to confess. I was thesecond gunman on the grassy knoll.

EINHORN 
Spare me the routine, Ventura. Iknow you're working the Snowflakecase. May I suggest you yield tothe experts on this one? We'llfind the porpoise.

ACE
(mock relief) 
Whewww… now I feel better!

Ace turns to go.

ACE (CONT) 
Of course, that might not do anygood. You see, nobody's missing aporpoise. It's a dolphin that'sbeen taken. The common HarborPorpoise has an abrupt snout,pointed teeth, and a triangularthorasic fin, while the BottlenoseDolphin, or Tursiops Truncatus,has an elongated beak, round,cone-shaped teeth, and adistinctive serrated dorsalappendage. (beat) But I'm sureyou already knew that. (beat)That's what turns me on about you.Hey… maybe I'll give you a callsometime, lieutenant. Your numberstill 911? Alrighty then!

Ace exits.

CUT TO:

INT. TEA ROOM - NIGHT

A wild thrasher club. An incredible thrash band is on stage cranking. Kids jump wildly into the moshing pit.

Ace enters, sees a burnout at the bar whose head is circling insanely to the music.

ACE
(shouting) 
Excuse me?! Is Greg here?!

The burnout's head thrashes on. No acknowledgement of Ace.

ACE 
Thank you!

Ace heads for the basement stairs.

INT. BASEMENT STAIRS - NIGHT

Ace descends the stairs, stopping at a large steel door. Ace bangs on it three times. A voice is heard from inside.

VOICE (O.S.) 
Password!

ACE 
Tom Vu! I pay for sex! You cantoo!

CLICK! The door electronically unlatches and slides open.

INT. BASEMENT - NIGHT

Ace enters. Green Peace "Save the Whales" posters abound. GREG/WOODSTOCK, a laid back, ex-hippy with long gray hair, sits at a very impressive computer set up. Ace and he have their own distinct banter.

A thud from above. Ace looks up.

ACE'S POV

Part of the ceiling is made of metal grating, so you can see the bottom of the dance floor. A guy's face gets smashed into the grate. We see that it is the burnout from the club.

ACE
(to burnout) 
Found him!

WOODSTOCK 
Hey! St. Francis! How's it goin?

ACE 
Super, and thank you for asking.Hope you're having a nice day.

WOODSTOCK 
Do you?

ACE 
Don't I? And what are you up to?

WOODSTOCK 
Just watching the fishies, man.

There is a BLIP on the computer screen.

WOODSTOCK 
Alright, you're just in time forthe party. You see those blips?

ACE 
I certainly do.

ON THE SCREEN

A map with several ships on the ocean.

He quickly taps in some commands and the ships start sailing in all different directions.

WOODSTOCK 
That's a Norwegian whaling fleet.I'm sending them new directionalcoordinates… They'll find JimmyHoffa before they find anyHumpbacks.

ACE 
Gravy.

Woodstock moves to a different screen.

WOODSTOCK 
Check this out.

More computer graphics come up on the screen.

WOODSTOCK 
Just changed the formula forPurina's puppy chow.
(turns to Ace) 
Too much filler, don't ya' think?

ACE
(acting turned on) 
I'm very attracted to you rightnow.

Woodstock chuckles.

WOODSTOCK 
Are you?

ACE 
Aren't I? Can you still tap intoall the aquatic supply store inthe area?

WOODSTOCK 
Of course I can. Why?

ACE 
I want to trace the sale of anyequipment for transporting orhousing a dolphin within the pastfew months…

WOODSTOCK 
C'mon, Ace. I thought you mighthave a challenge for me…

Woodstock starts hacking away.

ACE 
Okay then, try to remember thesixties.

WOODSTOCK 
Wow! God one! Let's see…Marine winch sling, feeder fish,20,000 gallon tank…

He waits. We hear a beep.

WOODSTOCK 
That's it. I found the culprit.

ACE 
Who is it?

WOODSTOCK
(dramatically) 
…Sea World.

ACE 
…bastard.

WOODSTOCK 
Hang on, hang on…
(He taps a couple keys) 
Well, what do we have here?That's a lot of equipment for acivilian.

The printer spits out some data. Woodstock rips off the page and hands it to Ace.

ACE 
Ronald Camp? The billionaire?

WOODSTOCK 
Billionaire and rare fishcollector.

ACE 
RRREHEHEALLY!

A PICTURE OF CAMP

Comes up on the computer screen.

WOODSTOCK 
That, my friend, is the face ofthe enemy.

He pages through his file on screen.

WOODSTOCK 
…Always tryin' to get his handson endangered species…

Newspaper articles fill the screen. One shows a picture of Camp and some Dolphin players.

ACE 
Hold on, this guy's connected withthe Dolphins?

Ace leans in.

WOODSTOCK 
Camp donated the land the newstadium's built on.
(re: article) 
Oh, look at this, he's throwin'another, "I'm the richest man inthe universe" party.

ACE
(thinking) 
Hmmm… I wonder if I can findmyself a date.

INT. CAMP'S MANSION - NIGHT

It's a magnificent home. There is an extremely formal party in progress. Twenty to thirty people having champagne, caviar, and hot air. We see Dan Marino sitting with an audience around him.

DAN 
We just choked in 82. We had achance to win and we didn't. Butnobody's gonna choke this time; ifthey do, I'll kill 'em!

Everybody laughs.

EXT. CAMP'S MANSION - NIGHT

Ace and Melissa climb an impressive stairway leading to Camp's mansion.

MELISSA 
I'm really going out on a limbhere, Ventura. Camp's socialevents are strictly A-list.

ACE
(a la Love Connection) 
'Well, Chuck… the date startedoff good, but just before we gotto the party, she seemed to tenseup.'

Melissa rolls her eyes, then taps a huge door knocker.

MELISSA 
I swear, if you do anything toembarrass me in front of Camp…

ACE 
You mean like this?

Ace starts doing a spastic body convulsion. Just then a bald-headed butler, who looks a little like Gavin McCloud, opens the door. Ace doesn't notice until Melissa hits him with her purse.

ACE 
Owwwe!!!

He sees the butler.

ACE 
Oh, hi Captain Stubing.

Melissa storms in, already pissed.

INT. CAMP'S MANSION - CONT

Ace and Melissa enter. Camp looks over.

CAMP 
Melissa! Glad you could make it!Oh, and who is this?

MELISSA 
This is my date. He's a…lawyer.

CAMP 
Well, does he have a name, orshould I call him "Lawyer"?

MELISSA 
I'm sorry, it's Ace - ah, Tom Ace.

Ace is very unimpressed with her lying ability. He jumps in.

ACE 
Tom Ace. Wonderful to meet you,Mr. Camp, and congratualtions onall your success. You smellterrific.

CAMP 
Ah, well, thank you. Please, comein.

Ace boldly leads the way over to an hors 'oeuvre table. Melissa closely follows.

MELISSA
(sotto) 
This is insane. There's no waythat Camp stole Snowflake.

ACE
(spreading pate' on a cracker) 
Will you just keep him occupied,while I work my magic please.

She crosses the room. He puts the cracker in his mouth and begins to crunch. A man in a tux beside Ace spreads pate' on his own cracker.

ACE
(with a mouthful, to man) 
Smooshy, isn't it?

Off the stuffy man's reaction…

INT. CAMP'S MANSION - SECONDS LATER

Ace approaches Camp.

ACE 
Excuse me, Ron, I need to use thebathroom?
(palms his stomach, whispering loudly) 
I think it's the pate'.

CAMP 
Um, it's just over there.

ACE 
Thanks. Stuff probably looksbetter on the way out, huh?

Ace laughs, slaps Camp hard on the back and heads for the bathroom.

INT. BATHROOM - CONT

Ace wastes no time. He locks the door, turns on the water faucet, steps onto the toilet seat, opens and climbs out a window.

EXT. MANSION COURT YARD - CONT

Ace drops to the ground. He follows a pathway, through a gazebo and into a doorway, all the time quietly singing the musical score to 'Mission Impossible'.

INT. CAMP'S MANSION - FISH TANKS - CONT

Ace browses through a myriad of dramatically lit, salt water tanks, still singing. They're all filled with colorful exotic fish. Very impressive, but nothing large enough to house a dolphin. He continues on towards a large door.

INT. TANK ROOM - SECONDS LATER

A huge above-ground tank is covered with curtains to discourage onlookers. Ace swings open the large door and enters.

ACE 
Gravy.

Ace climbs a ladder on the side of the tank, singing more intensely now. The ladder leads to a narrow catwalk over the center of the water. Ace grabs a feeder fish from a pail and walks carefully out there.

CLOSE ON ACE. THIS IS IT.

He looks into the dark pool, but sees nothing. Now he stops singing, quietly squats down and dangles the fish over the water.

ACE
(gently) 
Snowflake… Here, Snowflake…Snooowflaaaake…

A GREAT WHITE LUNGES OUT OF THE WATER AND SNAPS ITS JAWS AN INCH FROM ACE'S FACE!!! NEEDLESS TO SAY, ACE IS A TAD SURPRISED.

He reels back, falling off the catwalk, into the water.

INT. CAMP'S MANSION - SAME TIME

Melissa is admiring some beautiful tropical fish. Camp approaches.

CAMP 
Wonderful, aren't they?

MELISSA
(nervously) 
Yes. They're incredible.

CAMP 
No matter what is going on in mylife, I can always watch themswim and be completely at peace.

INT. INDOOR POOL ROOM - SAME TIME

The water is still for a moment. Then, Ace breaks the surface.

ACE
(frantic, to himself) 
It's not Snowflake… It's notSnowflake.

Instantly, Ace's body is thrashed around back and forth through the water, the entire length of the pool.

ACE
(screaming) 
IT'S NOT SNOWFLAAAAKE!!! IT'S NOTSNOWFLAAAA!!!

INT. CAMP'S MANSION - LATER

A line is forming outside the bathroom. Camp and Melissa are seated nearby. He's getting curious.

CAMP 
Are you sure he's okay? It's beenan awfu;;y long time.

MELISSA 
Who, Tom? Oh, I'm sure he's fine.

Ace suddenly opens the bathroom door and stands there, completely drenched from head to toe, with his pants in shreds. Everyone stops. They all stare at Ace in amazement.

ACE
(loudly to the entire room) 
DO NOT GO IN THERE!
(fanning the air) 
Whewww!!

EXT. CAMP'S MANSION - LATER

Ace and Melissa are exiting. Camp stops in the doorway.

CAMP
(still confused) 
I'm very sorry, Mr. Ace. I'llhave the pluming checkedimmediately.

ACE 
Be sure that you do. If I hadbeen drinking out of that toilet,I might have been killed!

Ace shakes Camp's hand and notices his ring. He holds on to get a better look. It's a very distinct, commemorative ring.

Camp wants his hand back but Ace won't let go. Melissa finally drags Ace away.

MELISSA 
We'd better go.

Camp looks on and shakes his head.

INT. MELISSA'S CAR - NIGHT

Ace is thinking. Melissa is pissed.

MELISSA 
…Y'know, I don't even want toknow why your pants are missing!I don't care what happened! Youcould have cost me my job.

ACE
(on his own wavelength) 
I was wrong about Camp. He'sbreaking the law but he's not ourguy.

MELISSA 
It's a sure thing! It'sdefinitely him! Just get me inthere! Let me work my magic!

Ace takes the stone out of his pocket and studies it intensely.

ACE 
This is the key. Right here!

MELISSA 
Hiring you was the biggest mistakeI ever made!

ACE 
So small! So unnoticeable! Yetan invaluable piece… of ourtwisted little jigsaw puzzle!

Melissa stares at Ace like he's gone crazy. There is a flash of headlights and a car horn. Melissa swerves back into her own lane. Ace drops the stone somewhere on the seat and begins to search for it frantically.

ACE 
Damn it!
(to Melissa) 
Try to keep it on the road.

INT. MELISSA'S LIVING ROOM

Melissa enters, followed by Ace.

MELISSA 
So, you found a pebble inSnowflake's tank. Excuse me whileI call CNN.

ACE 
I found it in the filter. Andit's not a pebble. It is a rare,triangular cut, orange amber.

Ace hands Melissa the stone and quickly goes to one of her bookcases.

MELISSA 
What are you talking about?

ACE 
Tonight I saw the exact same stonein Camp's ring.

Ace finds a book on the Dolphin team and flips through it.

MELISSA 
I thought you said he didn't doit.

ACE 
N. Camp's clean. His ringwasn't missing a stone. Butwhoever was in that tank had aring just like his.

MELISSA 
Wait a second. What ring?

Ace hands her the book. It's open to a photo of…

ACE 
The 1982 Dolphin AFC Championshipring.

Melissa holds the stone up to the picture. It's a perfect match.

ACE 
I find the ring with the missingstone, I find Snowflake.

MELISSA 
How are you gonna do that?

ACE 
Simple.

MUSIC UP

CUT TO:

EXT. TRACK - DAY

Ace is wheezing and gasping for air as he struggles to jog up beside a large man who's running around the track at a very fast pace. When he finally catches up, he awkwardly tries to catch a glimpse of the man's ring and trips. The man just keeps going.

INT. FOOTLOCKER - DAY

Ace sits waiting with one shoe off. The store manager, an ex-player for the '82 team, sets down several shoe boxes. Ace checks out the ring.

CLOSE ON

A poster of the '82 team. The player we just saw is being crossed out.

EXT. HOTEL - DAY

Pan a few kids getting autographs from Marino and other players, ending on Ace dressed up and looking like a pimply kid. As the players sign, he checks their rings.

EXT. TRACK - DAY

Ace is again trying to catch the large man on the track. This time, just as he draws near, the man leaves him in the dust.

INT. SPORTS BAR - DAY

Two big guys finish arm wrestling. Ace steps up to challenge. He spends an undue amount of time preparing his grip, as he checks out the ring. Ace finally gets set and gives the "go ahead" nod. He is instantly thrown across the room.

CLOSE ON

The poster of the '82 team. Another group of players are being crossed out.

EXT. STREET

Ace spots a player driving along side him. He can't see his ring.

Ace deliberately cuts off the player's car and flips him off. The angry player flips Ace off. We see his ring is intact. Ace waves and drives off.

INT. MEN'S ROOM

One huge lineman uses a urinal. Ace, using the urinal next to him, nonchalantly tries to catch a glimpse of the guy's hands. The Lineman has a very angry look on his face, but after a beat it changes to a "come on" smile.

CLOSE ON

The poster of the '82 team. There is only one face that has not been crossed out. Ace circles it.

EXT. TRACK - DAY

Once again we see the large, fast man jogging toward camera. Suddenly Ace runs up behind him, with a desperate look on his face, pouring a bottle of chloroform into a cloth. He leaps onto the man's back, smothering him with the cloth and holding on for dear life. The man slowly gives up the fight and collapses. Ace casually checks the ring, then walks away disappointed.

EXT. MELISSA'S BACKYARD - EARLY EVENING

Ace sits in a lawn chair depressed. Melissa consoles him.

MELISSA 
Ace, that stone could have comefrom anywhere. An earring, anecklace…

ACE
(with murder in his eyes) 
It came from an '82 AFCChampionship ring.

MELISSA 
Lt. Einhorn thinks it was ananimal rights group. Have youheard of FAN?

ACE 
Free Animals Now? Started in 1982by Chelsea Gamble, daughter of thefamous industrialist, FischerGamble? Over half a millionmembers from Florida to Finland?
(beat) 
No. Who are they?

MELISSA 
Did you know that last year theysent threatening letters to 127college teams, demanding therelease of their mascots? At lastcount –

ACE 
What do you feed your dog?

We see Melissa's dog lying near Ace's feet.

MELISSA 
Ah… dog food, why?

ACE 
He's miserable.

MELISSA 
What are you talking about?

ACE 
He's just very unhappy, I feelsorry for him. Bad diet, isolatedenvironment. It's amazing he'sstill alive.

MELISSA 
You're just mad because yourstupid pebble theory didn't workout and you don't know how toexpress your anger.

ACE 
Yeah? And you're ugly.

MELISSA 
I'm not even gonna' talk to you,please leave.

ACE 
What, so you can beat him? Fatty!

MELISSA 
You… are unbelievable.

The phone rings inside the house. Melissa goes to answer it.

MELISSA 
Hiring you was a huge mistake!

The door slams and Ace is alone with the dog. After a moment he reaches down to pet it and we all see that it is one of the happiest dogs in the world.

ACE 
You like her, huh?… Yeah, she'salright.

Ace, feeling guilty, walks into the house.

INT. MELISSA'S DEN - CONT

Ace walks toward Melissa.

ACE 
Look, Melissa, I, ah…

Ace stops when he sees Melissa. She is sitting, holding the phone in her lap with a completely stunned look on her face. Something is very wrong.

EXT. HIGH RISE APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

Chaos. Police, lights flashing, paramedics, crowds of people.

Ace and Melissa see Roger Podacter's body taken away in an ambulance.

ACE 
You okay?

Melissa nods bravely. Emilio joins them.

ACE 
What'd you find?

EMILIO 
Podacter, Roger. Routine suicide.He was alone. He'd been drinking.No sign of a struggle. Neighborheard him scream on the way down.Just your classic fifteen storyswan dive.

Melissa shudders. Ace gives Emilio a "way to go" look.

EMILIO 
Sorry.

INT. HIGHRISE LOBBY - NIGHT

The three enter. Emilio pushes the button for the elevator.

MELISSA 
It just seems so out of character.He was going to retire in twoyears.

ACE 
Did he leave a note?

The elevator arrives.

EMILIO 
No. That's nothing unusual. Somedo, some don't. He didn't.

The elevator doors close.

INT. PODACTOR'S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER

Police are everywhere. Emilio, Ace and Melissa enter and are immediately approached by one of the officers.

EMILIO 
Miss Robinson, this is officerCarlson.

CARLSONEvening, ma'am. I wonder if youcould answer a few questions aboutthe deceased?

Ace slips away, we follow him as he eavesdrops on conversations.

NEIGHBOR
(to a cop) 
I told you, I was across the hallin my apartment, I heard a scream.The door was locked, so I calledthe manager…

The Manager reiterates her story to the cop. The Manager is about 100 years old.

MANAGER 
…The place was empty, except forthe damn dog in the other room.Then I opened the balcony door,looked over the railing,and… splat, bang, pancake time…

Ace, continuing his investigation notices…

PODACTER'S DESK

in perfect order.

Next, he notices police coming in and out of the balcony, closing the door behind them, shutting out the noise.

INT. PODACTER'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

A dog is cowering in the corner. Ace tries to comfort the little guy.

ACE 
Hey, fella, have a bad night?

Ace examines its paws.

Ace then gets down and finds scratches in the door. TWO FEET interrupt.

Ace stands. He is face to face with Einhorn.

EINHORN 
Who let Dr. Doolittle in?

Emilio steps in immediately.

EMILIO 
Ah, Lieutenant. He came with MissRobinson –

EINHORN 
This is official police business.We'll let you know if the coronerfinds any ticks.

Cops snicker.

EMILIO 
I just thought since Melissa –

ACE 
E, forget it. She's right.Besides, I wouldn't want someonetracing my steps and pointing outall the mistakes I made.

Ace crosses to…

EXT. PODACTER'S BALCONY - CONT

Ace examines the area. Einhorn is in hot pursuit.

EINHORN 
Oh, so, you don't think this in anobvious suicide, Mr. PetDetective?

ACE 
Well, I wouldn't say that. Lordknows, there is plenty of evidencehere to support your theory,except of course that spot ofblood on the balcony.

On the railing, sure enough, there is a tiny spot of blood.

Einhorn glares at a couple of nearby cops. They look down.

ACE 
May I tell you what I thinkhappened? Alrighty then!

Ace moves as he talks.

ACE 
Roger Podacter went out afterwork. He had a few drinks, and hecame home. But he wasn't alone. Someone was with him in thisapartment. There was a struggle,and then Roger Podacter was thrownover that balcony. Roger Podacterdidn't commit suicide. He wasmurdered.

A beat as everyone considers this.

EINHORN 
Well, that's a very entertainingstory, but real detectives have toworry about that little thinglawyers call evidence.

Ace picks up a lottery ticket on Podacter's desk and becomes a condescending kid show host.

ACE 
Let's take a trip to cluecorner, shall we? Can anyone tellme why a man buys a lottery ticketon the day he is going to commitsuicide? Or why the family pet,suffering from acute caninetrauma, clawed at the bedroom dooruntil his paws bled? How aboutthe blood on the railing? I'llbet if we put our thinking caps onwe'll see that it was the resultof the struggle that took placeinside this apartment while Mr.Podacter was still alive!
(singing) 
NEXT TIME YOU DON'T HAVE A CLUECOME ON BACK TO CLUE CORNER! BOOP!

Everyone looks to Einhorn.

EINHORN 
Not a bad try for a pet detective,but not near conclusive enough forus real investigators.
(beat) 
First, people buy lottery ticketseveryday. It's a habit. Itdoesn't prove a thing. Second,the dog wasn't suffering fromcanine trauma, he was sufferingfrom bladder trauma. SergeantNeilson found a piss stain as bigas Lake Huron near the bed. Andthird, the blood on the railing.Simple. He doesn't jump farenough and whacks his head. Afact confirmed by the paramedicswho found cuts on his scalp, withtraces of a white chalkysubstance. i.e. plaster from thebalcony.

Einhorn shows Ace the paramedics report. Everyone is impressed with Einhorn.

EINHORN 
So much for your murder, Ventura.

AGUADO 
Uh oh, I think I heard a toiletflush. Maybe someone lost theirturtle?

Everyone has a laugh. Ace looks beaten.

ACE 
Well, maybe I'm just a little outof my league, here. Einhorn…

Ace holds out his hand, Einhorn shakes it.

ACE 
…good work.

Ace and Melissa head for the door.

ACE 
Oh, there is just one more thing,Lieutenant.
(re: the neighbor) 
This man is Roger Podacter'sneighbor. He lives across thehall. He said he heard a scream,is that right, sir?

The neighbor nods. Ace turns to the apartment manager.

ACE 
And you said you had to open thebalcony door when you keyed intothe room?

MANAGER 
That's right.

Ace walks out onto the balcony and turns, facing them.

ACE 
You're certain you had to openthis door?

She nods.

EINHORN 
What's the point, Ventura?

ACE 
Only this…AAAAAAAWWWWWWWWWWW…

Ace sustains an incredible Pavorati note, while he repeatedly opens and closes the glass door between them. When the door is closed nothing can be heard.

ACE
(tapping the door) 
This is double paned, sound-proofed glass. There's no waythis neighbor could have heardPodacter scream on the way downwith this door shut. The screamhe heard came from inside thisapartment, before Podacter wasthrown over the railing! And themuderer closed the door before heleft!
(celebrates insanely) 
Yes! Yesss! I have exorcised thedemons!
(a la Poltergeist) 
This house is clear.

INT. ACE'S CAR - A SHORT TIME LATER

Ace drives straight ahead.

MELISSA 
What are you thinking?

ACE 
I'm thinking this whole thing isconnected somehow.
(frustrated) 
I'm thinking I want to find thatother ring!

MELISSA 
You checked all the rings.

ACE 
I know, Pessimistress. Couldanyone else have gotten a ringthat year?

MELISSA 
No. Camp was the only honoree.Just players and coaches.Everyone in the photo.

ACE 
…Receipts! There must bereceipts! You have a key to theoffice.

MELISSA 
Ace this has been a really toughday. Can't we do this in themorning?

Ace looks at his watch.

ACE 
Absolutely.

EXT. DOLPHIN HEADQUARTERS - 1:00 AM

Ace's car screeches to a stop, in front of the building. Ace jumps out, followed by Melissa.

INT. DOLPHIN HEADQUARTERS - HALLWAY - NIGHT

It's dark. Team pictures adorn the walls.

MELISSA (O.S.) 
These files go back to seventy-eight.

INT. DOLPHIN OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Ace is flipping through a file cabinet, looking at receipts. Melissa is starting to warm to him.

MELISSA 
That was pretty impressive, whatyou did back at the apartment.

ACE
(still looking) 
You don't have to tell me. I wasthere.

MELISSA 
Maybe you should have joined thepolice force… become a realdetective.

ACE
(shaking his head) 
I don't do humans.

Melissa gets a bit closer.

MELISSA 
You really love animals, don'tyou?

Ace stops searching and looks into her eyes.

ACE 
I feel a kinship with them. Iunderstand them. Wanna hearsomething kinda spooky?

MELISSA 
Sure.

She gets closer still.

ACE 
One time, when I was about twelve,I had this dream that I was beingfollowed by a dog with rabies. Hehad these really bloodshot eyesand foam coming out of hismouth… and just before I got tomy front door… he jumped on meand sunk his teeth in. Then Iwoke up, and felt the back of myneck… check this out.

Ace motions for Melissa to feel the back of his neck, but when she does, he snaps at her hand, barking like a vicious dog.

ACE 
ARARAR!!!

Melissa jumps out of her skin.

MELISSA 
Ohhh!! You bastard!

ACE
(snickering) 
I'm sorry. I couldn't stopmyself. Are these all thereceipts?

MELISSA
(mildly annoyed) 
I don't know.

ACE 
There's only a dozen of them here.

Ace turns from the file cabinet with a hopeless look on his face. Melissa begins to clean up his mess.

MELISSA
(pointedly) 
Gee… maybe they were misplacedbecause somebody didn't put thefiles back when he was…

ACE 
Who the hell is that?

MELISSA 
What…

Ace crosses to a big picture of the '82 team that hangs on the aadjacent wall and points out a player.

ACE 
That! Who the hell is that?!

He quickly pulls out his crossed out pictures of the team and begins to compare the two.

MELISSA 
Oh, that's Ray Finkle… thekicker. Don't you know who RayFinkle is?

ACE 
No! How come he's not in thispicture?!

Melissa checks Ace's photo.

MELISSA 
This was the picture you wereusing? This was taken earlier inthe year. Finkle wasn't added tothe roster till mid-season.

She starts to realize what Ace has already figured out.

MELISSA (CONT'D) 
He's the guy that missed the finalfield goal in the Super Bowl thatyear. Cost the Dolphins the game.

ACE 
But he got a ring?

MELISSA 
Definitely.

INT. STADIUM/PUBLIC RELATIONS OFFICE - LATER

Ace and Melissa look through Finkle's file on a microfiche screen. Newspaper articles, headshots flash before them…

MELISSA 
'Replacement Kicker Having GreatYear'… 'Ready For Super Bowl,Confident Kicker Boasts'.

ACE 
'Field Goal Sails Wide, DolphinsLose Super Bowl'.

MELISSA 
The kick heard round the world.That was Finkle. The Dolphins lostby one point.

Another headline hits the screen: FINKLE CONTRACT NOT RENEWED.

MELISSA 
Poor guy.

ACE 
Poor guy with a motive, baby.Where is he now?

MELISSA 
Last I heard, he went back to hishome town, Collier County. Heused to work in a bar up there.

ACE
(pondering) 
REHEHEALLY.

MELISSA 
Can you drop me off before you go?

ACE
(shaking his head) 
No way. It may not be safe atyour apartment, and you shouldn'tbe left alone.

MELISSA 
What do you suggest?

CUT TO:

INT. ACE'S BEDROOM - LATER

We see a person's butt under a sheet coming up into frame repeatedly.

SKIN, SWEAT, SHEETS FLY, as Ace and Melissa roll back and forth on the bed. Ace is taking no prisoners.

CUT TO:

50 animals at the bottom of the bed, with eyes as big as silver dollars, watching them silently. We cut back and forth between furious lovemaking and shots of staring animals.

Melissa and Ace simultaneously reach the pinnacle of pleasure.

MELISSA
(totally amazed and exausted) 
OH man… oh man! Oh wow!

ACE
(mock embarrassment) 
I'm sorry… that's never happenedto me before. I must be tired.

EXT. HIGHWAY ONE - DAY

Various traveling shots of Ace en route to a 'Deliverance' type town deep in the Everglades. A sign reads "Gas - Food - 2 Miles" but the word "Food" is crossed out.

INT. BILBO'S GAS STATION - DAY

A pitifully sad country song plays on the radio. FERN BILBO sits at his cluttered desk with the end of an old shotgun in his mouth. He is struggling to reach the trigger.

Through the glass behind him, we see Ace's car pull up to the only gasoline pump.

DING! The bell rings. Fern begrudgingly takes the gun out of his mouth, sets it down and walks out.

EXT. BILBO'S GAS STATION - CONT

Ace gets out of his car.

ACE 
Excuse me, sir. Do you know whereI can find the Pigskin Sports Bar?

FERN 
Do I have a "kick me" sign on myback, son?

ACE 
I wouldn't know anything aboutthat, but if you could point metoward the bar.

Fern breaks down, sobbing.

FERN 
They all left me… all of them!

ACE 
Well… Hypothetically speaking,say they all left you and went tothe Pigskin Sports Bar. How wouldthey have gotten there from here?

FERN 
Two miles down and take the firstleft.

ACE 
Thanks very much! Take care now,'bye 'bye then!

Ace gets into his car and pulls out.

INT. BILBO'S GAS STATION - CONT

Fern enters, sits down at the desk, places the end of the shotgun in his mouth, reaches for the trigger and…

DING! Another car pulls up to the pump. Exasperated, he takes the gun out of his mouth.

FERN
(murmers to himself as he gets up) 
Can't get anything done aroundhere…

EXT. PIGSKIN SPORTS BAR - DAY

A weathered dive in the middle of a swamp. Ace parks.

INT PIGSKIN SPORTS BAR - DAY

If depression had a home, this is it. Several dejected men, with various degrees of missing teeth, sit around the bar. A couple hapless guys play pool. One throws darts.

Ace enters, pops a sunflower seed in his mouth and addresses the room.

ACE 
Excuse me, guy?! My name is AceVentura, I'm a pet detective. I'dlike to ask you a few questions if I could.

No one even looks at him.

ACE 
Just a few questions, that's all.

Still no one reacts.

ACE
(very up) 
Who wants gum?!

Again, no reaction. Ace walks over to the bartender and slides a five across the bar.

ACE 
I'm looking for a guy who used towork here.

The bartender takes the money.

BARTENDER 
That right?

ACE 
He was a kicker for the Dolphins.Ray Finkle.

A pool ball flies by Ace's head shattering a mirror behind the bar. All eyes are on Ace.

ACE
(to guy who threw it) 
That would be a scratch.

TOOTHLESS GIANT 
You a friend of Finkle's?

ACE
(thinks) 
…Yes?

CRASH! The giant guy smashes his bottle.

ACE 
Sorry, I have "say the opposite ofwhat you mean" disease.

Several undesirables surround Ace.

TOOTHLESS GIANT 
That bastard ruined this town.

ACE 
Ewww… I hate that!

HICK #2 
We bet everything we had on thatSuper Bowl and that son of a bitchgagged.

ACE 
What a diiick!

They all move closer in a threatening manner.

HICK #3 
Shanked a goddamn 26 yarder!!!

ACE 
Death to Finkle! Death to Finkle!

The bartender steps in.

BARTENDER 
We had a hell of a thing goinghere. Tourists coming to see RayFinkle's home town. He wasstanding right over there when hegot the call from the Dolphins.

The bartender points to a payphone. It has had the shit beaten out of it. Every expletive you can think of is graffitied around it.

ACE 
Did he come back after the SuperBowl?

BARTENDER 
Yeah… but the boys here had waysof letting him know he wasn'twelcome.

HICK #1 
Excuse me, I gotta take a wickedFinkle.

Laughter.

TOOTHLESS GIANT 
What's the difference betweenFinkle and a jackass? A jackasscan kick.

More laughter.

HICK #2 
Why did Finkle cross theroad?!

ACE
(facetious) 
Wait… I know this one.

HICK #2 
He didn't! And I've got the hair onmy bumper to prove it!

Maniacal laughter and chanting ensues.

MOB 
FINKLE SUCKS! FINKLE SUCKS!FINKLE SUCKS!

ACE 
It's good you're dealing with theanger.
(beat) 
I don't suppose anyone's seen himlately?

The chanting stops and the guys all look at Ace.

BARTENDER 
No… but we know where hisparents live! Don't we boys?!

HICK #1 
Yeah! We sure do!

They all laugh insanely again.

EXT. HOUSE - DAY

Ace pulls up outside a two-story stilt house. The place has been completely desecrated by graffiti, bullet holes and paint bombs. Toilet paper is strewn through the trees. Ace walks up and knocks on the door. A wooden peephole slides open revealing a suspicious pair of eyes.

ACE 
…Hi, I'm looking for Ray Finkle.

A gun slides out into Ace's face.

ACE
(with a gulp) 
And a clean pair of shorts.

A deep gruff voice from inside.

VOICE 
What do you know about Ray Finkle?

ACE 
Southpaw soccer style kicker.Graduated from Collier High inJune, 1976. Stetson Universityhonors graduate, class of 1980.Holds two NCAA division onerecords. One for most points in aseason, one for distance. Formernickname The Mule. The first andonly pro athlete ever to come outof Collier County. And onehelluva model American.

After a beat the peephole closes. The door slowly creaks open revealing MR. FINKLE, an unsmiling, taciturn, elderly man holding the gun.

MR. FINKLE 
Are you another one of themscumbags from 'Hard Copy'?

ACE 
No, sir. I'm just a very bigFinkle fan. This is my Graceland,sir.

Mrs. Finkle, a sweet, adorable elderly woman comes over.

MRS. FINKLE 
Will you put that gun down. Theboy's a fan of our son. So niceto meet you. I'm Ray's mother,and this is Ray's father.

INT. FINKLE HOUSE - DAY

ACE 
It's a real honor.

MRS. FINKLE 
My Ray is so appreciative of hisfans. He'll be so pleased youstopped by.

ACE 
Are you expecting Ray anytimesoon?

MRS. FINKLE 
Oh, yes. I expect him home anyminute.

Ace is surprised.

MRS. FINKLE 
Would you like some cookies? Ijust baked them.

Mrs. Finkle hurries off to the kitchen. Ace smiles at Mr. Finkle. The guy's a corpse.

ACE 
Wow… Ray Finkle's house! Can'twait to meet him!

MR. FINKLE 
Ray ain't comin' home.

ACE 
But your wife said you expect himhome any minute.

MR. FINKLE 
She expects him home any minute.

He points to his head, and looks toward the kitchen.

MR. FINKLE 
Engines runnin but there's no onebehind the wheel. Ten years agoour son escaped from Shady AcresPsychiatric Hospital in Tampa.They're still buggin' us to pickup his stuff.

Mrs. Finkle returns with a plate of football shaped cookies.

MRS. FINKLE
(sweetly) 
It was all that Dan Marino'sfault, everyone knows that. If hehad held the ball laces out, likeyou're supposed to, Ray wouldnever have missed that kick. DanMarino should die of Gonorrhea androt in Hell. Would you like acookie, son?

Ace takes a cookie. Holding it up.

ACE 
Hey, what do ya know. They'relittle footballs.

MRS. FINKLE 
Laces OUT!

CRASH!! A large stone smashes through the window. Outside, a pickup truck filled with drunken patrons from the Pigskin Sports Bar drives by yelling their Finkle chant.

MOB 
FINKLE SUCKS! FINKLE SUCKS!…

MRS. FINKLE 
I told you he had a lot of fans.

Mrs. Finkle picks up the rock and hurls it out the broken window. It hits one of the vandals, knocking him out cold, as the truck peels away.

MR. FINKLE
(aside to Ace) 
She got the arm. The boy got theleg.

INT. HALLWAY - A SHORT TIME LATER

Mrs. Finkle and Ace are walking down the hallway to Ray's room.

MRS. FINKLE 
When Ray gets back and startskicking again, he'll never evenknow he was gone. I kept his roomjust the way he left it.

She opens the door to Ray's room. Ace steps in.

INT. RAY'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

It's a death shrine to Dan Marino. Complete with lifesize cutouts of Dan Marino, some with nooses around the neck, other hacked to pieces. Painted on the walls: "Death to Marino!", Marino must die!!!, etc.

ACE 
…Oooh boy.

MRS. FINKLE 
What a sports nut, huh?

In the center of the room is a movie projector.

ACE 
May I?

MRS. FINKLE 
Oh yes. By all means.

Mrs. Finkle shuts the lights off. Ace turns on the projector.

The film flickers over the "Marino must die!!!" graffiti. It's the final play of the Super Bowl. Marino takes the snap, Finkle kicks and the ball sails wide. The film repeats itself ad infinitum.

EXT. BILBO'S GAS STATION - DAY

Ace on the payphone. We see the gas station in the background.

ACE 
Melissa, it's Ace.

INT. MELISSA'S OFFICE - DAY

MELISSA 
Ace? Where are you?

INTERCUT ACE/MELISSA

ACE 
I'm in Psychoville and Finkle'sthe Mayor. Where's Dan Marino?

MELISSA 
Marino? Why?

ACE 
Because he's about to joinSnowflake. I gotta know where heis.

MELISSA 
Okay, hold on…

Melissa checks Marino's itinerary. Ace waits, impatiently.

ACE
(to himself) 
Come on. Come on…

In the background, we see two paramedics exit the gas station office rolling a dead body on a gurney. The area of the sheet that covers the face is a giant red spot. We widen to see them load good old Mr. Bilbo into an ambulance and drive away, ringing the station bell one more time. Ace doesn't notice.

MELISSA 
Ah, he had practice. Then… hehas a commercial shoot out at thePrescott Sound Stage.

ACE 
Where is that?

MELISSA 
It's on Route One by the Six CutOff. Thirty minutes outside oftown.

ACE 
Okay, that's about fifteen milesfrom me. Call the police. Getextra security over there now.

MELISSA 
Ace, tell me what's going on.
(beat) 
Ace?…

The payphone dangles off the hook. Ace is…

EXT. HIGHWAY ONE - DAY

…in his car racing out of the swampland, his heaad now back out the window so he can see. He leaves a faded, old, barely legible sign in his wake:"

WELCOME TO COLLIERCOUNTY. HOME OF RAY FINKLE"

The "F" in "FINKLE" has been replaced with "ST" in spray paint.

INT. PRESCOTT STUDIOS - DAY

Rehearsal for an Isotoner ad in progress.

MARINO 
…So I protect the hands thatprotect me. With Isotoners.

Marino gets carted off by FIVE HUGE LINEMEN.

DIRECTOR 
Good. Remember, exit cameraright. That's to your left.Alright, let's get ready to shootthis.

FIRST A.D.
(to the linemen) 
Helmets on this time!

The linemen disperse.

EXT. STREET - DAY

Ace runs a red light causing cars to skid in every direction.

INT. PRESCOTT STUDIO - DAY

Marino is in the make-up chair.

MARINO
(to make-up girl) 
See, in 82 we just choked. We hada chance to win it and wedidn't –

DIRECTOR 
Dan, are you ready?

MARINO 
Ah, sure.
(to girl) 
I'll tell you later.

EXT. STUDIO - DAY

The cops race onto the lot.

INT. STUDIO - DAY

Marino takes center stage.

A.D.Quiet on the set… roll…speed…

DIRECTOR 
…And action!

MARINO 
Hi, I'm Dan Marino. If anyoneknows the value of protection,it's me…

We see an old clip of Marino getting sacked.

EXT. STUDIO - DAY

Cops scramble on foot to the sound stage.

INT. STUDIO - DAY

The commercial is winding up. The linemen ready themselves.

MARINO 
…So I protect the hands thatprotect me. With Isotoners.

The five linemen grab Marino and run off camera.

DIRECTOR 
And cut! That was good. Againfrom one.

But two of the linemen keep running with Marino…

DIRECTOR 
I said cut!!

…And they keep running.

DIRECTOR (CONT'D) 
What the hell are they doing?

…Right out the studio door. Then the cops arrive and race after them. Two linemen stumble out of the dressing room holding their heads.

EXT. SOUND STAGE - DAY

Ace skids around a corner, looking way up ahead.

He sees Marino being shoved into a black 81 Ford Bronco. They drive off.

The cops come out of the building on foot. Too late.

Ace in hot pursuit almost runs the cops down.

ACE
(yelling at cops) 
S'cuse meee! Pet Detective!

EXT. CITY STREETS - DAY

Ace's head is out the driver's window through the entire chase. As he starts gaining on the bad guys, they start shooting. Ace wisely puts his head inside the car.

ACE'S POV

He can't see shit through his broken windshield.

He pokes his head out again. They shoot again.

Ace swerves off the road into…

EXT. PARK - DAY

Ace's car smashes through benches and tables. Then it flips over a few times and lands on its wheels with a horrid SMASH. Ace is still strapped into the drivers seat, unconscious.

Ace's prized WHITE PIGEON lands on the car door right beside him. Ace cracks his eyes and sees the bird. Then, with a sudden quick lunge he successfully traps it in his hands, and forgets all about Marino.

ACE 
I did it! I did it! I caught thewhite pigeon! I caught the whitepigeon!

Ace jumps out of his car and starts skipping around the park with the pigeon held high over his head. He looks insane.

ACE (CONT'D)
(singing) 
I caught the white pigeon, Icaught the white pigeon, I caughtthe white…

Ace slows down and begins to look around warily. There are now an unusual number of birds perched on the telephone wires around the park and on the monkey bars, and on the swings.

The sky grows darker. He slowly turns and tries to get back to the car. All the birds take flight.

Ace sets the white pigeon free and starts to run, but it's too late. The birds are on him. Pecking, and gouging, and ripping his flesh.

Now we see ten birds flying away with a leg. Five birds flying away with an arm. Twenty others are trying to take Ace's left arm off, and half his face is missing…

ACE 
AAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!

CUT TO:

EXT. PARK - DAY

Ace is back in his wrecked car with his arm hanging out the window. A small boy is pulling it.

BOY 
Hey mister. Hey mister.

Ace come to suddenly, and looks at the boy with a crazed expression.

BOY (CONT'D) 
That was a really neat crash,mister. Do it again!

Ace sighs with relief.

EXT. MIAMI - DAY

Various headlines hit the news stands: "MARINO KIDNAPPED" "STAR QB MISSING" "DAN WHERE ARE YOU?"

THE GLOBE HEADLINE: "MARINO ABDUCTED BY ALIEN FRANCHISE!" On the cover, Marino stands with several Space Aliens in football gear.

EXT. POLICE STATION - LATER THAT DAY

A chaotic press conference. Zillions of REPORTERS shout all kinds of questions at Einhorn.

REPORTER 
Lieutenant, have there been anyransom demands?

EINHORN 
There's been no communication withthe kidnappers at this time.

REPORTER #2 
What's going to happen to theSuper Bowl? Will it be postponed?

EINHORN 
As of now, the game is going on asscheduled.

REPORTER #3 
Why wasn't the public told aboutSnowflake's kidnapping?

EINHORN 
Secrecy was essential. We didn'twant any public interference.

REPORTER 
Are the crimes related? And whatabout Roger Podacter's murder?

EINHORN 
I'm sorry. I can't comment anyfurther. Now if you'll excuse me.

Einhorn pushes her way through the crowd of reporters.

INT. POLICE STATION - MOMENTS LATER

Einhorn is barking out orders to other cops as she heads for her office.

EINHORN 
Emilio, get me the autopsy onPodacter! Aguado, send out amemo. No one talks to thepress…

INT. EINHORN'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS ACTION

EINHORN 
…And somebody get me a cup ofcoffee!

ACE
(TV announcer's voice) 
Tonight on "MIAMI VICE", Crockettgeets the boss coffee!

Ace is in her office, popping sunflower seeds, kicking back. Einhorn walks to her private bathroom.

EINHORN 
Ventura, when I get out of thisbathroom, you better be gone.

ACE 
Is it number one or number two?

Einhorn turns and glares at Ace.

ACE 
I just want to know how much timeI have.

Einhorn goes to the sink and begins washing her hands.

ACE 
Oh, by the way, I went ahead andsolved that pesky,Snowflake/Podacter/Marino thing.

EINHORN (O.S.)
(humoring him) 
Oh yeah?

ACE 
yeah, ever hear of a formerDolphin kicker named Ray Finkle?

The water shuts off. Einhorn appears around the corner.

EINHORN 
Alright, Ventura. Make it quick.

ACE 
I found a rare stone at the bottomof Snowflake's tank. It's from aDolphin '82 AFC Championship ring.It would have been a Super Bowlring, but Ray Finkle missed thebig kick. Blames the whole thingon Marino. We're talkingparanoid, delusional psychosis. Isaw the guy's room… Cozy, ifyou're Hannibal Lector.

EINHORN 
So how does Roger Podacter fit in?

ACE 
My guess is Finkle was snoopingaround. Podacter recognized him.End of story. As for Snowflake…they gave him Finkle's number, andtaught him how to kick a fieldgoal. Finkle took it personally.

Einhorn listens with great interest.

EINHORN 
So where is Finkle, now?

ACE 
He broke out of a metal hospital.Did a Claude Raines. He's beenplanning his revenge for years.Waiting for the perfect time toget back at the Dolphins. The timewhen it would hurt them the most.Super Bowl time! Man, I'm tiredof being right!

Einhorn walks in front and sits on the edge of the desk. She's totally softened her demeanor.

EINHORN 
Congratulations. You've done somefine detective work, Ace.

ACE 
Ahh, could you talk in my goodear. I thought I heard you callme Ace.

Einhorn gets real close.

EINHORN 
Maybe I was wrong about you.Maybe you are more than just a petdick.

SHE SUDDENLY PLANTS A MAJOR, TONSIL CLEANING, OPEN MOUTHED KISS ON ACE. Objects are knocked off the desk as they lean back.

ACE 
Your gun's digging into my hip.

More kissing, the Ace stops.

EINHORN
(still coming on) 
What's wrong, Ace? Want me toread you your rights?

ACE 
Maybe later.

EINHORN 
What is it? That bony littlebitch, Melissa Robinson?

ACE
(defensive) 
No. You just don't do anythingfor me.

He quickly adjusts his crotch, to conceal the erection. Einhorn withdraws with a coy smile.

EINHORN 
I'll be here if you ever want areal woman.

There's a sharp KNOCK at the door.

EINHORN 
What is it?

Aguado opens the door.

AGUADO 
Everything okay in here? Heardsome commotion.

EINHORN 
Fine, Sergeant.

AGUADO 
You want me to throw him out?

EINHORN 
Why don't you throw yourself out.

AGUADO 
…Yes, ma'am.

A crestfallen Aguado exits. Ace heads for the door.

EINHORN 
Ace, I want you to leaveeverything to us.

ACE 
Can't do that, Lieutenant. I washired to find Snowflake.

EINHORN 
When we find Marino, We'll deliverSnowflake.

ACE 
When I find Snowflake, I'lldeliver Marino.

He exits.

INT. TEA ROOM - NIGHT

A full on thrash metal band is cranking on stage. Kids leap wildly into the moshing pit. The same Burnout is still thrashing his head wildly to the music.

ACE
(shouting) 
Nice to see you again!

The Burnout just keeps thrashing. Ace spots Woodstock watching the band and joins him.

WOODSTOCK 
St. Francis, how's it goin'?

ACE
(kidding) 
That's none of your damn business.

WOODSTOCK 
Isn't it?

ACE 
Is it?

WOODSTOCK 
Anything new on that dolphin?

ACE 
Got his picture on some tuna cans,but nothing so far.

A singer ROARS on stage. He sounds like a garbage disposal full of cutlery.

SINGERArroohhghhh! Myrrrooohghhhh!Geroooghhh!

WOODSTOCK 
So, what can I do for you today?

ACE 
I need info on a football flunkynamed Ray Finkle.

WOODSTOCK 
Sorry, Ace, I can't help you rightnow. I gotta watch this band!They are the shit!

ACE 
Are they?

WOODSTOCK 
Aren't they?

ACE 
Alright then. Don't worry aboutit. I mean dolphins aren'texactly an endangered species.It's not like the whole foodchain's gonna be affected if onehighly intelligent mammal dies aslow and painful death! Hell, ifthe band is loud enough, you won'teven hear its pitiful whimpering!!

Ace does his best suffering dolphin impression. Woodstock is no longer enjoying the band.

CUT TO:

INT. BASEMENT - NIGHT

Woodstock is at his computer. Ace looks over his shoulder. Finkle's Social Security information appears on the screen.

WOODSTOCK 
This guy's last reported incomewas September, 1982.

ACE 
Well then. We know he'sincredibly thrifty.

WOODSTOCK 
Is he?

ACE 
Isn't he?

Woodstock types in more information. Finkle's TRW flashes on the screen.

WOODSTOCK 
Well, I think we can be prettysure he's involved in thekidnapping of the dolphin.

ACE 
Really? What makes you say that?

WOODSTOCK 
There's two-thousand dollars worthof smelts on his VISA card.

After a beat Ace realizes it was a bad joke.

ACE 
Please yank me no further. I begof you.

WOODSTOCK 
Alright already. The last timethis guy used his credit card wasJune, '84. He rented a car fromAvis. And… eww… he was a badboy. They found it abandoned twomonths later in South Miami.

ACE 
Anything else?

WOODSTOCK 
Nope.

ACE 
Well… you did all you could.Thanks for nothin.

WOODSTOCK 
Hey man, according to this, yourfriend Ray Finkle doesn't exist.

ACE 
Hmm, I know what that's like.

WOODSTOCK 
Do you?

ACE 
Don't I?

INT. TEA ROOM - NIGHT

Ace emerges from the basement. The band is between songs. Ace strolls by the burnout whose head has now stopped.

ACE
(to burnout) 
Did you get all the spiders outtathere?

Ace heads out, then freezes. The two thugs that took Marino are standing at the exit. Then they see Ace and start towards him, reaching inside their coats.

Suddenly the music starts. The burnout's head wails again. His manic gyrations interfere with the thugs long enough for Ace to bolt.

One of the thugs pushes the burnout violently against the wall as they pursue Ace.

BURNOUT
(calling, as he gets up) 
Thanks, man! You're a greatdancer!

Ace pushes his way through the crowd. The thugs follow.

Ace nears the stage. It's wild. People are diving off and getting moshed.

Before the thugs grab him, Ace runs up and throws himself from the stage. The insane crowd begins to pass him around over their heads.

The thugs exchange a look, then dive after Ace, and a "mosh" chase ensues.

Ace is passed back onto the stage as the song comes to an end. The singer is lying there exhausted. Ace sees the crowd starting to put the thugs down, so he quickly grabs the microphone off the floor.

ACE
(screams) 
ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR, SPANK MEMOMMY!!!

The audience looks at Ace for a second. Then the band members exchange a look and go for it!!

It's a nightmarish little ditty. Ace sings like one of Satan's minions.

ACE 
URGHHUURRAAAW! ARGHUURRRREEEW!

The crowd seems to understand. They throw the thugs high in the air again and mosh them away from the stage. The Thugs are shooting stray bullets the whole time.

Ace incites the crowd, even more now, with a punching gesture. The crowd follows their new leader, punching with one hand, moshing with the other.

The thugs get the living crap "moshed" out of them.

When the song ends, Ace raises fists in the air. The cheering crowd violently drops the thugs. They're out cold.

EXT. TEA ROOM - NIGHT

Ace's car PEELS OUT and races by the parked '81 Ford Bronco.

EXT. MELISSA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Ace's car skids to a halt. He hops out.

INT. MELISSA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

There's a loud BANGING at the door. Melissa awakens, looks at the clock: 3:32 a.m. She drags herself to the door.

MELISSA 
Who is it?

ACE (O.S.) 
Ira.

MELISSA 
Ira who?

ACE (O.S.) 
I refuse to do a 'knock knockjoke'. Come on, open up!

Melissa opens the door.

MELISSA 
Ace, what are you doing? It's themiddle of the night!

ACE 
You have to commit me.

EXT. HIGHWAY - DAWN

Ace's clunker speeds down the highway.

ACE (V.O.) 
Finkle escaped from Shady Acres inTampa. They still have some ofhis stuff.

MELISSA (V.O.) 
So you think they're going to letus just waltz in and look around?

EXT. SHADY ACRES - ESTABLISHING - DAY

A state hospital located on acres of green, manicured lawns.

INT. SHADY ACRES - DAY

The reception area. A DOCTOR is before Melissa.

DOCTOR 
Mrs. Robinson? I'm Doctor Handly.Now who is it that you'd like tohave us look at?

MELISSA 
My brother… Eugene.

ANGLE ON ACE - Looking like the football player who never wore a helmet.

ACE 
I'm ready to go in, Coach. Justgive me a chance. I know there's alot riding on it, but it's allpsychological. Got to stay in apositive frame of mind. Memorizethe play book. Study the films.

Ace strikes a dramatic pose and freezes, with a crazed look on his face.

ACE (CON'T) 
I'm gonna execute a button-hookpattern!

He begins to make a play in slow motion.

ACE (CON'T) 
Super slo-mo!

CUT TO:

EXT. SHADY ACRES HOSPITAL - DAY

Melissa walks with the Doctor. Patients are sitting around, doing outdoor therapy, etc.

DOCTOR 
You're brother won't be the firstprofessional football player we'vetreated.

MELISSA 
Is that right?

DOCTOR 
Yes. We're very sensitive to theemotional stress athletes have toendure.

Ace runs across the b.g. screaming "I'm open! I'm open!"

DOCTOR 
We'll have to do some preliminaryevaluations, but I think yourbrother will fit in nicely here.

MELISSA 
That's a relief, Doctor.

Ace takes a "snap" from a three-foot hedge and dives over it into the end zone. Melissa and the doctor stop to watch him.

DOCTOR 
He seems to have some difficultyletting go of the game. Has hehad a long history of mentalillness?

MELISSA
(truthfully) 
As long as I've known him.

Ace does a wild touchdown dance with some of the other patients participating.

INT. SHADY GLADE ACRES - HALLWAY - DAY

The doctor is showing Melissa around. Ace is walking alongside them adjusting his imaginary shoulder pads.

DOCTOR 
This is our therapy room… Artsand crafts…

They turn a corner. Ace squats to pick the dirt out of his cleats.

DOCTOR (CON'T) 
That's the storage room. Thishallway leads to anotherrecreational area –

Ace WHISTLES loudly and gestures like a referee…

ACE 
HALFTIIIIME!!

Ace sticks his head in the water fountain then sits down on the bench outside the storage room.

MELISSA 
He'll be fine by himself for thenext twenty minutes.

DOCTOR 
Well, why don't I show you thedormitories, then?

They leave Ace.

After a beat, Ace gets up and does a quick spin pattern into the storage room door.

INT. STORAGE ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Cartons everywhere. Ace does a quick search and locates several boxes maked FINKLE.

Ace looks through the first couple of boxes and finds only clothes. In the third box, he hits the jackpot: He finds sicko arts and crafts dedicated to Marino. Die-Dan potholders, shredded Isotoner gloves. He opens a little diary. "Laces Out!" is insanely scrawled on every page.

Ace finds a newspaper clipping, the headline reads:

SEARCH CALLED OFF FOR MISSING HIKER

ACE
(reading) 
A massive search ended today whenrescue workers were unable to findthe body of Lois Einhorn…
(stunned) 
…a camper reported lost sinceFriday…
(to himself) 
Lois Einhorn… holy shit balls.

Ace sits bewildered.

INT. POLICE STATION - DAY

The phone rings at Emilio's desk. He answers it.

EMILIO 
Echavez.

INT. SHADY ACRES - HALLWAY - DAY

Ace is on the phone. A CRAZY GUY is hovering nearby.

ACE 
This is Chicken Little. The skyis falling.

EMILIO 
What?

BACK TO EMILIO

A beat as he listens to Ace's news.

EMILIO 
I don't get it. What's it mean?

INTERCUT ACE/EMILIO

ACE 
It means she's involved in this.The article's dated the day beforeFinkle disappeared.

EMILIO 
Before who disappeared?

ACE 
Finkle. Ray Finkle… the guy whotook the dolphin? The guy you'resupposed to be looking for?!Einhorn didn't tell you, did she?

EMILIO 
Hey, Ace. I see where you'regoin' with this and you're goin'alone.

A Crazy Guy stands next to Ace now and begins mimicking everything he says.

ACE 
Come on, E. I tell her aboutFinkle, she doesn't tell a soul.I have an article here thatconnects her with Finkle. Yougotta' check her out.
(to Crazy Guy mimicking) 
Do you mind?

The Crazy Guy stops and moves to one of the phones.

EMILIO 
Ace, I like my job. I get healthinsurance and benefits.

CRAZY GUY
(into receiver) 
I'm the Lindberg Baby. Come andget me.

ACE 
Emilio, Einhorn is involved.You're gonna' have to make adecision here.
(beat) 
Listen, I gotta get off the phone.I think I just solved the Lindbergcase.

Melissa and the Doctor return.

DOCTOR 
Well, look who's trying to use thephone.

Ace covers the phone receiver and whispers to them in a heartfelt voice.

ACE 
Brian Piccalo is dead.

Ace breaks down. Melissa hangs up the phone and leads him away.

We hear a thrash version of the theme to "Brian's Song" as they exit the hospital.

INT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT

Emilio stands at a window, watching Einhorn drive off. The coast is clear so he sneaks into…

INT. EINHORN'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

He rifles through her file cabinet. He tears through papers. Then he looks in her desk.

Stuffed in the back of the drawer he finds a personal note: We can make out the signature. Roger. He pockets it and walks out.

EXT. MELISSA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Ace and Melissa pull up in the old heap.

ACE 
Good job today. You're quite adirty rotten filthy liar.

MELISSA
(flattered) 
Thanks. Are you sure you don'twant to stay here with me?

ACE 
Naw, I got some thinking to do.Besides, you'd be safer withSalman Rushdie

MELISSA 
Okay.

She gets out of the car, then turns and leans in the window.

MELISSA 
Listen… I know there isn't muchtime left. The game is tomorrow.But I know you've done your best.It's just an impossible situation.I don't expect..

ACE 
Hey…

Ace leans over and kisses her.

ACE (CONT'D) 
…bet on the Dolphins.

INT. ACE'S APARTMENT - LATE NIGHT

CLOSE UP: ANSWERING MACHINE

Wiggles' nose enters frame and hits the play button.

We widen to find Ace on the couch listening.

MESSAGE #2 
Ace, it's E. Got something youmight find interesting. It's anote from Podacter to Einhorn,thanking her for a wonderfulSaturday night. This is tooweird, man?

ACE 
Wiggles, rewind.

Wiggles obediently hits another button and rewinds the phone tape. Ace pops sunflower seeds, and holds some evidence aloft thinking. A bird eats seeds out of his naval.

ACE 
What the hell does Lois Einhornhave to do with Ray Finkle? Comeon, think!

DISSOLVE TO:

Later. Ace is posed like Rodin's "The Thinker".

ACE 
Finkle and Einhorn. In ittogether. How? Why?

A small monkey sits in the same position. Mocking Ace.

DISSOLVE TO:

Later still. Ace pacing, jumping up and down. Trying to get his intuitive juices flowing. The monkey is likewise, jumping on the mantle.

ACE 
Alright! Here we go! Answer'sright there! Just gotta get someblood to the brain! Finkle andEinhorn! Finkle and Einhorn!Finkle and Einhorn! Finkle andEinhorn!

The animals all watch him like he's crazy.

DISSOLVE TO:

Daybreak. Ace sits staring at a picture of Finkle on the coffee table. He's totally spent and on the verge of tears.

ACE
(whimpering) 
Finkle and Einhorn. Einhorn andFinkle.

He turns to see the monkey crashed out in a heap on a sofa pillow.

ACE
(to sleeping monkey) 
Quitter.

Wiggles jumps up onto the coffee table now. Ace can't be bothered with him.

ACE 
What do you want? Huh?

Wiggles whines at the tone of Ace's voice.

ACE (CONT'D) 
What? I got no food for you. Yougotta have money to buy food. Igotta find the dolphin to get themoney. I don't see any dolphinsaround here, do you? Face it,it's hopeless… your master is aLOSER.

Ace buries his face in his hands. His dog Wiggles does the same. Then Ace looks up again.

ACE 
LOO… HOO…

Suddenly he is silenced by something amazing.

Wiggles' dark haired floppy ears are lying around Finkle's picture like a wig. Ace combs the hair over the head shot. The "make-over" is unmistakable. It's Einhorn!!

ACE 
Oh, my god! That's it!

He jumps up, estatic.

ACE 
Einhorn is Finkle! Finkle isEinhorn!… Einhorn is a man!!!

Ace's expression quickly turns sour.

ACE 
OH MY GOD!!! EINHORN IS A MAN!!!

MUSIC UP: AEROSMITH'S DUD LOOKS LIKE A LADY…

Ace makes a mad dash into the bathroom.

INT. ACE'S BATHROOM - MORNING - QUICK CUTS

…Ace furiously brushes his teeth.

…Ace rinses with mouthwash, spits it out and gags.

…Ace is in the shower. He slowly curls up into a ball under the steaming water with an expression of horror on his face.

INT. EINHORN'S HOUSE - DAY

CLOSE UP:

A woman's leg being shaved.

Woman sexily putting on nylons.

Woman hands squeezing perfume bulb.

Woman's hand putting on AFC championship ring. One stone is missing.

EXT. EINHORN'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Ace sticks wads of gum in his mouth while he watches Einhorn's house from his car.

ACE
(remembering) 
You're gun is sticking into my hip.Yeeeekkkk!

Einhorn comes out her front door and gets into her car. Ace shudders once more and then follows her.

EXT. MIAMI STREET - DAY

The road is jammed in one direction. Going towards the Super Bowl. Einhorn drives in the opposite direction. Out of town. Ace tails her at a safe distance, with his head out the window, of course.

INT. BOBBY RIDDLE STADIUM - DAY

Various shots of crazy fans, piling into the stadium.

INT. STADIUM OWNER'S BOX - DAY

Melissa, BOBBY RIDDLE, and GUESTS all amidst the usual pre-game hobnobbing. Most of the talk centers on the loss of Marino.

Emilio, in full uniform, and a couple cops are providing extra security for the box.

EXT. HIGHWAY ONE - DAY

Einhorn drives south out of town. The area's getting remote. Ace follows.

Einhorn turns down a deserted road and comes to…

EXT. INDUSTRIAL PLANT - DAY

A large, abandoned industrial facility. Einhorn parks, disappears inside…

A few beats later, Ace kills the engine and exits singing the score to "Mission Impossible".

INT. INDUSTRIAL PLANT - DAY

Immense machines and swimming pool sized cauldrons.

Ace cautiously makes his way through the desolate site, singing quietly now. He stops when he hears a familiar voice.

JOHN MADDEN (O.S.) 
I particularly like the match-upsof the defense.

Ace sees a weird sight: A HUGE TV PROJECTION SCREEN tuned to the Super Bowl pre-game show. Marino is tied to a football tackling sled. The two thugs take turns running into Dan with their shoulders, driving him back five feet each time.

JOHN MADDEN (ON TV) 
…But the real story of this gameis the absence of Dan Marino. Himbeing kidnapped and all has got tobe a strain on this Miami team. Ireally feel sorry for those guys! Imean, it's hard enough enduringthe pressure of the Super Bowl,without your star quarterbackgettin' himself kidnapped. Thisis the whole ball of wax, folks!You wanna' get kidnapped, you doit in the off season!…

Marino looks incredulously at the screen. Next to him, Snowflake "watches" from a ground level cistern serving as an ad hoc tank.

Ace sneaks closer.

INT. BOBBY RIDDLE STADIUM - DAY

The crowd quiets as Jon Bon Jovi prepares to sing the National Anthem.

Various shots of fans all standing at attention.

In the owners box, Melissa looks to Emilio. Nothing's new.

INT. INDUSTRIAL PLANT - DAY

Einhorn is now in front of the big screen TV SINGING the National Anthem along with Bon Jovi. The thugs, VINNIE and ROC, are behind her standing at attention.

The song ends. The crowd cheers.

In a sultry fashion Einhorn circles Marino now.

EINHORN 
I just love Super Bowl Sunday,don't you, Dan? A magicalafternoon where dreams are made…or crushed!

DAN 
Look lady, if you want tickets,you're going about it in the wrongway.

EINHORN 
Do I look familiar to you, Dan?Does it seem as if we've metsomeplace before?

DAN 
I don't know… I get hit in thehead a lot!

On the TV the ref makes an announcement.

REFIt's tails. The Eagles willreceive.

Dan really struggles now.

EINHORN 
Oops. Looks like we're going tohave to kick, Dan.

Einhorn steps behind a football set up on a tee. And in perfect sync with the kicker on TV, she boots a ball through a window of the warehouse.

Marino doesn't know what to think.

EINHORN 
I made some refreshments, Dan.Would you like some refreshments,Dan? I'll be right back,Daaaan!!

She goes. Dan struggles, but to no avail.

MARINO 
Look, I don't know how much psychowoman is paying you guys, but Ican double it.

VINNIE 
Sorry, Danny boy. Psycho womankeeps us out of prison.

Vinnie grabs a feeder fish and entices Snowflake to the surface. Roc raises a football.

ROCHey, Marino, check it out. I'mthrowin' passes to a Dolphin!

He chucks the ball and hits Snowflake, hard. The thugs both laugh hysterically.

Snowflake makes an angry leap and drenches the thugs. Snowflake laughs now, the thugs are furious.

VINNIE 
Get some more fish!

INT. BEHIND MACHINERY - CONTINUOUS

Roc walks behind a big piece of machinery, reaches down for the pail of smelts, but sees nothing.

ROCWhere the hell's the smelts?

He stands up straight and we all hear that familiar "Pop" of a sunflower seed being cracked open.

Roc's eyes widen. He turns and sees…

Ace coyly smiles at him, blows the sunflower seed shells into his face and CLANG! He whacks Roc in the head with a pail full of fish.

ACE
(doing Brando) 
He sleeps with the fishes.

INT. INDUSTRIAL PLANT - CONTINUOUS

VINNIE 
Hey Roc, what the hell was that?

Vinnie cocks his gun and goes to check out the sound.

INT. BEHIND MACHINERY - CONTINUOUS

Vinnie rounds the corner and sees nothing. He walks a little further and notices a trail of smelts lined up on the ground.

He follows the trail around a corner and we see Roc, unconscious but moaning. He is sitting against the ground, with his legs spread apart and the pail over his head. The trail of smelts leads to his crotch. There is one halfway into his zipper, with its tail flipping.

Vinnie takes in this sight, then rushes over to Roc and stands him up.

VINNIE 
Hey man! What happened? What'sgoin on…?

We see Ace at the top of a giant machine. He is aiming a 200 pound steel hook, that hangs on a chain from the ceiling.

ACE 
Guess what, boys, it's nap time.

Ace gently releases the hook. Just as Vinnie and Roc turn to look, the iron hook shears both of their heads clean off.

Two headless bodies fall to the ground in slow motion with blood gushing from their necks.

CLOSE ON ACE - HORRIFIED

ACE 
Hooooly Shiiit! Oh my god! Ididn't mean to - Oh man!!!

Ace holds his head and dances around, completely freaking out what he had done.

ACE
(looking to God) 
Lord, I swear! I just wanted toknock them out!

Ace abruptly stops to think.

ACE 
Is that murder? I don't know.They were gonna kill me. But theydidn't… But they tried. That'sself defense. That's it!! I havenothing to worry about!!

CUT TO:

Ace nervously whistling as he wipes his fingerprints off the hook.

INT. IRONWORKS FACTORY - FACTORY

Ace checks on Snowflake then goes to Marino. He signals for Dan to keep quiet, then starts to untie him.

MARINO
(whispers) 
Who are you?

ACE
(whispers) 
Ace Ventura. Pet detective. I'vebeen sent in with a special play.
(whispers) 
Quarterback sneak.

WE HEAR THE CLICK OF A GUN.

EINHORN (O.S.) 
Penalty. Too many men on thefield.

Ace turns. Einhorn's holding a gun on them from the other side of Snowflake's tank.

EINHORN (CON'T) 
I warned you, Ventura.

ACE 
What happened to "Ace"?

EINHORN 
Good question.

She pulls out a cellular phone and dials.

ACE 
Be careful with that phone,lieutenant. I wouldn't want youto get a tumor.

EINHORN
(into phone) 
Sergeant Aguado, it's Lt. Einhorn.Get some men over to the oldironworks factory on VictoriaRoad. I've got the kidnappertrapped in the warehouse. It'sAce Ventura. He's killed Marinoand Snowflake.

Einhorn smiles as she puts the phone away.

EINHORN 
Vinnie! Roc! Get in here!

Ace gets a very guilty look.

ACE 
What? Who are they? You meanthere's other people here?

EXT. POLICE STATION - DAY

A battalion of cop cars screech away as we hear…

RADIO DISPATCHER
(V.O.) 
Attention all units. Code 11 inprogress at 343 Victorville Road.Officer needs back-up…

INT. BOBBY RIDDLE STADIUM OWNER'S BOX - DAY

The cops and Emilio listen to their ear pieces…

RADIO DISPATCHER
(V.O.) 
…Suspect's name: Ace Ventura,male Caucasian, he is armed anddangerous…

Emilio nudges Melissa.

EMILIO 
It's Ace. Let's go.

INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Emilio high tails it out of there. Dodging concession stand patrons, bathroom lines, etc… Melissa runs behind, trying to catch up.

MELISSA 
Emilio, is he in trouble?

EMILIO 
Don't worry, there's nothing Acecan't handle!

INT. IRONWORKS FACTORY - DAY

Einhorn cocks her gun. Ace's face is glistening with tears. He's a complete wreck.

ACE 
Don't kill meeee!!Pleeheeheeheeheeeezzz!!! I'llnever tell anyone! I swear!
(indicating Marino) 
He's the one you want!! Killhim!!

MARINO
(indicating Ace) 
No… kill him!

The two argue. Einhorn fires a shot in the air to stop them.

EINHORN 
No, I'm gonna kill the dolphinfirst.
(to Ace) 
I wouldn't want you to miss that.

Einhorn walks to the edge of the tank. She aims the gun at Snowflake and FIRES!

We see the bullet miss Snowflake under water.

Snowflake swims wildly. She FIRES again! Misses again. Suddenly, Ace HOLLERS!

ACE 
Blue forty-two!!

Einhorn turns to Ace.

EINHORN 
SHUT UP!!

ACE 
BLUE FORTY-TWO!

Einhorn shoots at Ace! He dives out of the way.

ACE 
HUT! HUT!

Suddenly, Snowflake leaps out of the water and takes the gun out of Einhorn's hand, like the trick we saw earlier. Snowflake swims around the pool with the gun in his mouth.

ACE
(smug) 
Yes. The highly trained dolphin.Perhaps the smartest mammal in theanimal kingdom. See how he knewexactly what I wanted him to do,as if our minds were somehow incomplete synchronization. Theyhave been know to save men at seayou know. They have their ownlanguage.
(to Snowflake) 
Snowflake. Come here, Snowflake!Bring me the gun!
(makes dolphin sounds) 
EEEEEE! EEEEEE! EEEEEE!

Just like the trick in his routine, however, Snowflake swims around the tank, passes Ace, then hands the gun back to Einhorn. He finishes with a tail walk.

ACE
(under his breath) 
Stupid fish.

ON TV: Miami's kicker boots a perfect field goal from fifty yards.

JOHN MADDEN 
He got all of his leg into thatone!

The field goal kicker is hugged by his teammates.

ACE 
Good to see someone who doesn'tbuckle under the pressure?

MARINO 
Yeah, not like in 82 when wechoked…

Einhorn walks to Ace and puts the gun against his head.

EINHORN 
What would you know aboutpressure?

ACE 
Well, I've kissed a man.

JOHN MADDEN (ON TV) 
Of course, there's never been amore crucial kick than the famousKick heard 'round the world…

The famous footage airs on TV. They all turn to watch.

JOHN MADDEN 
…I mean, it's clear to me thatit was a good hold. Finkle justbooted it.

EINHORN 
The laces weren't out. THE LACESWEREN'T OUT!!

Einhorn takes a shot at the screen, creating a hole in Madden's forehead. Ace uses the moment to smack the gun out of her hand.

A HUGE, NO-HOLDS-BARRED FIGHT ensues. Ace and Einhorn punch each other about the face and stomach.

Einhorn throws a punch at Ace. Ace goes down.

Einhorn goes for the loose gun. Ace leaps and tackles her.

They both crash into old rusty equipment, raising a mountain of dust. Marino struggles all the while trying to get free.

Einhorn kicks Ace. He flies into Marino.

MARINO 
Having a little trouble with thelady, Ace?

ACE
(out of breath) 
You don't understand, she's a –

Einhorn grabs Ace, throws him into a head lock and begins wailing on his face.

Meanwhile, cops start arriving, SWAT team members disperse onto the catwalk as the fight continues. They try but can't get a bead on Ace as the two roll around on the floor.

More punches. They fight up a flight of stairs, then back down. To the amazement of the SWAT team, Ace and Einhorn slug it out as equals.

AGUADO
(caught up) 
Get him, Lois!

Now they crash through a plate glass window together. Ace gets to his knees first and wobbles toward the gun. It's the first clear shot the SWAT team has had.

EINHORN
(screaming) 
Shoot him! Shoot him!

We all hear the guns cocked. We see Ace in the rifle sights. We see fingers twitch on triggers.

A loud voice comes from off camera.

EMILIO 
DON'T SHOOT! HOLD YOUR FIRE!

Melissa is holding Emilio's gun under his chin.

MELISSA 
Put down your guns or this copgets it!

The SWAT team hesitates.

MELISSA (CONT'D) 
I mean it!!

Much to Emilio's surprise, she cocks the gun.

EMILIO
(whispers to Melissa) 
Ah… Melissa? That's a hairtrigger.
(loud to cops) 
She's not joking!

The SWAT team leader signals his men. They lower their guns. Einhorn gets back to her feet.

EINHORN 
He kidnapped Snowflake. He killedRoger Podacter, and he was aboutto kill Dan Marino and me!

ACE 
Ho, ho! Fiction can be fun! ButI find the reference section muchmore enlightening.
(doing his best Clarence Darrow) 
For instance, if you were to lookup 'professional football's alltime bonehead plays', you mightread about a Miami Dolphin kickernamed Ray Finkle, who missed atwenty-six yard field goal in theclosing seconds of Super BowlSeventeen.
(in one breath) 
What you wouldn't read about ishow Ray Finkle lost his mind, andwas committed to a mentalinstitute, only to escape and jointhe police force under the assumedidentity of a missing hker,seducing her way to the top, in adiabolical plan to get even withDan Marino whom he blamed for theentire thing!!!

Ace gasps for air. Everyone is totally confused.

AGUADO 
What the hell are you trying tosay?

ACE 
She's not Lois Einhorn! She's RayFinkle! She's a man!

EINHORN 
He's lying! Shoot him!

Ace walks over to her.

ACE 
Let's just see who's lying. Woulda real woman have to wear one ofthese?

Ace dramatically pulls at Einhorn's hair, thinking it's a wig. Einhorn's head flies back. The hair is real. Ace keeps tugging it.

The SWAT team ready themselves.

ACE (CONT'D) 
Boy, that's really on there! Buttell me this: Would a real womanbe missing these?!

Ace rips open Einhorn's blouse, and reveals two beautiful feminine breasts.

The sharp shooters are tensing. Ace is laughing nervously now.

ACE 
Ha, ha, ha! That kind of surgerycan be done over the weekend! ButI doubt if she could find the timeduring her busy schedule to getrid of Mr. Knish!!

Ace rips off Einhorn's skirt. Einhorn now stands there fully nude. She appears to be the perfect figure of a woman.

ACE 
Oooh boy.

Ace looks at Melissa and Emilio and shrugs his shoulders. Then, just when it seems all is lost, Dan Marino who is back behind Einhorn, motions for Ace to come over.

MARINO 
Psst… Ace. Come here.

ACE
(to everyone) 
Could you excuse me just a second.

Ace goes to Dan. Melissa still holds Emilio hostage.

EINHORN 
Shoot him. Shoot him, now!!

MELISSA
(to cops) 
Don't anybody make a move!

Marino whispers something in his ear. Ace looks confident again. He once more addresses the crowd.

ACE 
Ladies and gentlemen, my esteemedcolleague Mr. Marino, has justbrought some new evidence to myattention. Now, history hascertainly shown that even the mostintuitive criminal minds can bewrong, from time to time. But, ifI have been mistaken… if thelieutenant is indeed a woman…then my friends, she is sufferingfrom the worst case of hemorrhoidsI have ever seen!!!

Ace spins Einhorn around now, exposing to the world, the healthy set of male genetalia that Finkle has learned to keep tucked between his legs. (And if we have any balls, we'll actually show it.)

Everyone gasps. CLOSE UP ON EINHORN/FINKLE. He finally drops the facade.

FINKLE
(deepest voice possible) 
It was Marino's fault. The laceswere in.
(breaking down now) 
They were IN!!!

Quick cuts of all the cops spitting with disgust. Then Emilio spits.

Then CLOSE ON Marino spitting. They all have kissed her/him/it. Even Snowflake blows his spout.

Ace confidently cracks a sunflower seed.

ACE 
Somebody read it its rights.

Suddenly, Finkle picks up a shard of broken glass and lunges at Ace.

FINKLE 
DIE ANIMAL BOYYYYY!!!

Thinking fast Ace sidesteps Finkle and sends him head first into Snowflake's makeshift tank. After a few seconds Finkle fights his way to the surface and thrashes around, helplessly.

FINKLE
(gasping for air) 
Help I can't swim!!!

Finkle goes under again. We see him under water sinking down.

Snowflake swims to him now, allowing him to grab onto his fin and pulls Finkle gently to the side of the pool. Finkle lies there exhausted.

Ace reaches down into frame, removing the '82 AFC Championship ring from Finkle's finger. We see that it's the ring with the missing stone. Ace replaces it with the stone in his pocket. It's a perfect fit.

ACE 
LLLOOOSER! LLOO HOO SERR HERRHERR!!!

Melissa is still holding the gun on Emilio.

EMILIO 
Melissa… you can give me back mygun now.

Melissa has forgotten she even had the gun. She hands it to Emilio and faints in his arms.

Now Aguado appears beside Ace.

AGUADO 
I don't know how you did it,Ventura… but that was damn goodpolice work. Alright guys, let'swrap this up!

EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

Twenty or more police cars in single file provide more than ample escort for…

…Ace and Marino in Ace's Chevy Bel-Aire with the cracked windshield. Both of them have their heads sticking out so that they can see. Marino has a wad of gum in his mouth.

HIGH ANGLE

The long line of flashing lights and cop cars drives at top speed up Route One. Ace's Bel-Aire right in the middle.

MARINO (O.S.) 
hey Ace?

ACE (O.S.) 
Yeah, Dan?

MARINO (O.S.) 
Got any more gum?

CUT TO:

INT. STADIUM - DAY

The Super Bowl Halftime Show is in progress. Marino is in uniform warming up. Emilio is drooling at the cheerleaders. Ace and Melissa are standing near the fifty yard line taking in the awesome spectacle.

Some fireworks go off around the tank. A marching band plays a triumphant tune. We see a helicopter come up over the side of the stadium carrying Snowflake.

ANNOUNCER (O.S.) 
Ladies and gentlemen, the MiamiDolphins are proud to welcome backto BOBBY RIDDLE Stadium, ourbeloved mascot and star of thehalftime show…

ANGLE ON

The helicopter lowering Snowflake into his tank.

ANNOUNCER (O.S.) 
Snowflake!!

As the crowd roars, Melissa turns to Ace, and with Snowflake in the background performing spectacular flips, they kiss.

ANOTHER ANGLE

As Melissa and Ace kiss, the prized 'White Pigeon' lands on a Gatorade dispenser in the foreground. Ace spots it and starts to make a move.

Just as he closes in for the grab, the Philadelphia Eagles mascot eagle walks up to get a drink and shoos the pigeon away. Ace is furious.

ACE 
You idiot! Do you know whatyou've done?!

The giant eagle head looks up at Ace.

MASCOT 
Huh?

Ace grabs him.

ACE 
You just cost me ten thousandbucks, Polly!

MASCOT 
Yeah Blow me.

ACE 
REE HEE HEE HEELYYY?!!!

PULL BACK to find Eagle's mascot and Ace arguing. We can't hear what's said, but there's a lot of finger pointing.

Emilio stops his leering to check out what's going on.

The ANNOUNCER up in the booth reads a release.

ANNOUNCER 
The National Football League wouldnow like to offer a special thankyou to the man who rescued DanMarino and our belovedSnowflake…

On the field the mascot shoves Ace. Ace shoves back.

ANNOUNCER (CONT'D) 
A great humanitarian, and lover ofall animals… Mr. Ace Ventura!

Ace is straddling the eagle, pounding the shit out of giant head.

The image is flashed on the big stadium screen. We freeze frame on this huge picture of Ace, as he looks into camera with his fist raised.

MUSIC UP: THRASH METAL

ROLL CREDITS

THE END

(LOKI NOTE: My copy of this script has the bloody end of Vinnie and Roc physically crossed out by three black marker lines, presumably by the authors. Fortunately, they were crossed out diagonally, so I could still type the scene out for all to enjoy.)
