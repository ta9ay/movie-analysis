We hear  windas we sail, like a glider, over the black atmosphere.We DIVE DOWN into the murkiness, through the clouds, into the   darkerworld of  the dead  surface of  Earth, the  desert of  the real.   Therotted skeleton of a massive city is sprawled everywhere. We  approacha fissure in the Earth's crust, and as we do, we hear the   increasingbuzz of multiple hovercraft  engines. Blue flashes grow  in  intensityfrom the fissure. Radio voices,  indistinct at first, grow louder   aswe approach the fissure.                             WOMAN (V.O.)           "Six o'clock, 300 meters. We can't outrun 'em."                              MAN (V.O.)    "I know. Can't tow this crate fast enough! We gotta ditch it!"We hear the voices as though we're listening to cops through a  policescanner. The woman is NIOBE, the captain of the lead ship, Sephora.                             NIOBE (V.O.)     "Can't, the core is still good. And they've got 'The One.'"                              MAN (V.O.)             "Oooh, our savior. Heíd better be worth it."                             NIOBE (V.O.)                "Shut up and make the exit. Hold on!"The azure glow  from the  fissure  is suddenly overwhelming.  A  tightconvoy  of  three  HOVERCRAFT  explode  from  the  fissure,  travelingnearly straight up, like a   trio of massive locomotives flying   intothe sky in tight formation,  linked together by tow cables.  The  blueglow has  been emanating  from  the  overworked flare  drives of   thefirst and third hovercrafts.  Between them, suspended by  tow  cables,is the dark, scorched,  and sliced NEBACHANEZZER. They  rocket upward,slowing as they reach the top of the arc.                             NIOBE (V.O.)                             "Woo-hoooh!"The rush to the ground, pulling up at the last second. The NEB  flailswildly between them.                              MAN (V.O.)                        "They're still on us!"More vehicles fly from the fissure. A massive army of SQUIDDIES  poursup onto the surface.INT. NEBACHANEZZER COCKPITThe NEB is slung between the two HOVERCRAFT, with the cockpit   facingbackwards.  TRINITY,  MORPHEUS,  TANK,  and  NEO,  the  former  ThomasAnderson, crowd the cockpit. Helpless, the landscape speeds away  fromthem, while a wall of red-eyed SQUIDDIES speeds to them.It's been a mere TWO DAYS  since the realization of NEOíS POWERS   andthe defeat of AGENT SMITH. The slipstream whistles violently into  theinterior  of the  ship, and  the crew  is cold,  tired, haggard,   andstressed beyond  belief as  they can  only watch  the action in  theirknocked-out ship.                      MORPHEUS is on a headset.                               MORPHEUS                      "Niobe, theyíre closing."

SEPHORA COCKPITNiobe breathes a sigh of relief. Her lieutenant looks back up to see awing of HOVER FIGHTERS - 'DEFENDERS' fly past their ship. Sleek,  withhuge blue flares from their engines, they're gunship fighters armed tothe teeth with missiles and laser turrets studding the fuselage.

The halfdozen clinging to FREEDOM'S hull  are picked off by well-placed  lasershots  that  turn  the  squiddies into  curdling  balls  of  slag. Thesquiddies that survive turn tail and run.INT. NEB COCKPITThe crew of the Neb breathe a collective sigh of relief as they  leavethe scene of aerial carnage behind them.NEO has been gripping an oh-shit handle on the edge of the cockpit. Herelaxes his grip as their escape is clear. Their ship suddenly  entersa cave, and starts  to descend. The blue  wash of the ship  shows rockwalls and pipes. The ships are slowing down as they descend back  intothe earth.TANK'S shoulders drop, and he leans back into his chair.                                 TANK                            "We're home."                               TRINITY          "Well, not yet, but we're in the defense screen."

The fighters that              just saved us constitute the first ring."                             NIOBE (V.O.)                    "Neb crew, you can relax now."                               MORPHEUS       "For the moment, perhaps. Its still a long drive home."                                                              FADE OUTandFADE INTO:TRINITY'S  CABIN.  At  first  we  see  only  stars  twinkling, farawaydiamonds on a black velvet background. The camera descends through thedarkness, to a sunset, dark blue, as if just after sunset. The artworkterminates in the metal ring going  around her room. It's a much  morehospitable place than the rest of the dreary hovercraft. The  articlesshe's collected during  her time in  the resistance dot  the cabin. Anunfinished sweatshirt sits on a loom. There are charcoal portraits  ofloved ones.Softly lit, the cabin sways slightly. The NEB is still in tow. NEO  issitting against the wall on Trin's bed, with her curled up beside  himwith her head on his lap.Neo canít sleep. He stares at the wall opposite him. There's a   photoof the crew of the NEB, sans Trin, in better days. Smiling,   laughingas they are  seated around the  table. Morpeus, Tank,  Dozer,  Switch,Epoch, Mouse. Neo stops on the image of a smiling CYPHER. There's   anunknown Asian man in the photo, looking withdrawn and a bit lonely.Gently,  placing  Trinity's head  down,  NEO stands  and  examines thephoto.                             She awakens.                               TRINITY           "I'll have to take that one down now. Cypher..."

NEO                       "What happened to him?"                          TRINITY is sullen.                         "He didnít make it."  NEO returns to the bed and sits down, disturbed. Trinity sits up,                              awakening.                                 NEO                          "Was he like me?"                            TRINITY nods.                               TRINITY      "Not you, though. Like you. There have been others, Neo."                         "Aren't you tired?"                                 NEO                 "No. I've never been a big sleeper."                               TRINITY   "I know. I used to watch you hacking without sleeping for days."               He turns to her, questions in his eyes.                                 NEO                  "How many 'ones' have there been?"                               TRINITY                       "That's not the point."                        NEO may not think so.                               TRINITY                     "You are him. Youíre mine."                                 NEO               "But what does it mean, to be The One?"                               TRINITY          "I don't know, Neo. Our mission was to find you."                                 NEO                           "So, now what?"                               TRINITY               "Now, Zion will give us a new mission."              The hatch swings open. MORPHEUS peers in.                               MORPHEUS       "We're almost home. We'll need a detail. Five minutes."                 HE closes the hatch and disappears.                                 NEO                        "Does he ever knock?"                               TRINITY                          "Not on his ship."                                                               CUT TO:INT. MAIN DECK, NEBThe crew grips the bulkhead and fixtures as the swaying ship comes  toa rest. Outside, the sounds of hover engines fade away. Tank   unlocksthe main hatch, then jumps as it drops, unpowered, slamming into   thetarmac with a resounding smash.                                                               CUT TO:EXT. ZION TARMACThe tarmac  is a  busy, crowded  military airport,  with hovercraft ofdifferent  sizes  spread  across  the  lot.  Its  housed  poorly  lit,houses in a cave so huge  the ceiling is out of site.  Crewpersons runaround,  servicing  battle-damaged   vehicles.  Munitions  are  cartedacross the tarmac on   robot rolling racks. No  one  pays the NEB  andits battered crew any mind.Nearby, the SEPHORA and FREEDOM  are parked. Their engines shut  down,and their powered hatches are open. The crewmembers are spilling out.NIOBE hurries to MORPHEUS' side, and he steps toward her, smiling, buttheir  military manner  is quickly  restored, though  they can  barelycontain their grins.                               MORPHEUS                              "Niobe..."              SHE shakes his hand, the shake slows down.                                 "M."                               MORPHEUS                       "Thanks for the rescue."   THEY close for a kiss, when the FREEDOM'S captain suddenly jumps                            between them.    It's CHOI - the NEO's supposed neighbor and hacking financier.    Exhuberant and oblivious, he joyfully gets in MORPHEUS' face.                                 CHOI "Brough, you us your asses! We saved you so hard core you don't even                                know!"   NIOBE smiles at Morpheus and fades back as BOOTH shouts his own           praises. Morpheus turns to his less-mature peer.                                 CHOI     "So, you think you finally found The One, huh? Another One?"  DUJOUR, CHOI'S LIEUTENANT, pushes into their conversation, looking                              offscreen.                                DUJOUR          "Idiot, we helped him find him.

He's  concentrating on TANK and his apparent girlfriend, who seems to be consoling him. He turns to see CHOI and DUJOUR, does a double-take,                       and his jaw drops open.                                 NEO                                "You?"

Her eyes dart to the ground, thousands of feet below thefinger.                               TRINITY          "In this construct program, the ground can kill."                                 NEO                    "I wonít let you fall. Ever."THEY look  into each  otherís eyes.  Despite the  trauma theyíve  beenthrough, and not even truly knowing one another, thereís a connection.NEO suddenly backs away. He walks on the air with perfect traction, asthough heís on an invisible plane of glass. He leaves TRINITY standingprecariously on  the edge,  wobbling a  bit as  she maintains  balanceagainst  nerves.  She  breathes  deep,  and  looks  back  up  at  NEO,maintaining her cool even as she eyes the spectacle.NEO stands a few  feet away from her,  completely at ease as  the highaltitude winds ruffle his hair.NEO extends a hand to her.                                 NEO"Itís not real, Trinity. Youíre not standing there. Step out. I can do                          it. You can, too."With one last  glance at the  infinite drop, she  steadies herself andstares straight into his eyes. Blue meet brown. Breathless, she  stepsstraight out.She takes one step in the  air. For a breathless second, as  she stepsoff the edge,  she is stable.  When she takes  her foot off  the edge,though, she sways,  and her foot  slips, as though  sheís on a  greasysurface bobbing up and down. She corrects herself, tries another step,sags further.                               TRINITY                               "Shit."SHE glances down, then locks eyes with NEO. Then drops like an anvil.                                 NEO                              "Whoops."HE  dives down,  shooting like  a missile.  TRINITY is  calm, fallingbackwards, watching NEO  come for her.  The rocky ground  looms behindher. She makes no effort to reach for NEO as he draws close to her. HEreaches for her with all his might.                                 NEO                              "Grab me!"TRINITY makes no effort to save herself, even as collision is  secondsaway.

He  barely accomplishes  this  before  he slows  andsettles onto the rocky ground.They are in a twilight glade shaded by the mountains.                                 NEO                   "What the hell were you doing?"         TRINITY smiles slightly. Her madness has a purpose.                               TRINITY                         "Showing you, Neo."                                 NEO        "Showing me what? You nearly gave me a heart attack."                               TRINITY          "I want you to know how much faith I have in you."                                 NEO              "Oh. And this requires acts of insanity?"TRINITY smiles. She looks him up and down. She moves intimately close.                    "So, you really are Superman."                                 NEO                     "Only when Iím plugged in." TRINITY steps away. NEO grabs her shoulder and turns her to him. He                              attempts a     kiss, but she turns her face, letting it land on her cheek.                                 NEO                               "What?"              TRINITY looks at him, then up at the sky.                               TRINITY                   "Itís not you. Just, not here."           NEO doesnít understand.

Growing irritated at  the untrainedattack, SMITH turns a block into a palm-heel that hits GREGORY in  theforehead with  the force  of a  cannon blast.  Momentarily stunned, hesteps back enough for SMITH to perform a roundhouse kick. Itís like  ahelicopter blade, smashing into GREGORYíS head and sending him to  theground in a heap.

SMITH       "Help us, and both you and her will be free afterward."GREGORY  stares  at the  ground,  then gazes  past  SMITH at  CHANDRA.Finally, he starts to rise. SMITH offers a hand, and GREGORY takes it.                                SMITH"You know it, donít you? That thereís more to your world than what you              can see, what you can rationally explain?"

But first, you need to learn to fight."SMITH puts his hand to his earpiece. GREGORYíS eyes close and his bodySPASMS. He falls to the ground, breathless, and when his eyes open, hestares up at SMITH.                               GREGORY                       "Holy shit. What the -"HE stares at his hands.

MORPHEUS                                "Go."CHOI checks his ammo and puts his guns under his coat. There are  lotsof people on the streets now. Everyoneís in shock over what  happened,and the columns of smoke rising from the center of the city.                                 CHOI"And remember, kids, when youíre in a war, never volunteer yourself!"HE walks out  onto the street,  eyeing the phone  booth and everythingelse. A  gorgeous Asian  businesswoman stumbles  into him. Recognitionlights up her face and she stops him.                                WOMAN          "Choi? Oh my God, I havenít seen you for months."       CHOI keeps looking around, making his way to the booth.                     "Oh yeah, sorry about that."                           SHE turns angry.         "Sorry about that? What kind of an asshole are you?"EXT. ALLEY (MATRIX) - DAYTRINITY is looking around the corner. She pulls back into the alley.                               TRINITY                "Casanova just ran into an old flame."EXT. STREET (MATRIX) - DAY                                WOMAN   "No. Fuck you, Choi, you just think you can come and go when you                               please?"CHOI is ignoring her now, walking straight for the phone booth as  sheis having a fit. Tears are welling in her enraged face."Choi, if you have one shred of decency, if you even care about me - "Inexplicably, CHOI  hangs his  trench coat  on the  side of the booth.Standing behind it, he reaches  around with his arm, keeping  the coatbetween his body and the phone. The WOMAN doesnít even notice the  webof gun harnesses and what looks like a ton of ammunition covering  theinside of the jacket.                                WOMAN  " - youíll tell me why you donít call, why you, you, what are you                               doing?"                                 CHOI"The jacket stops fragmentation. Sometimes they bomb the phones. Kiss                            me for luck."HE grabs her to him and thrusts his mouth onto hers.CU: PHONEHis hand grabs the phone. We hear the dialtone, and he mashes down oneof the  numbers of  the keypad.  The number  tone rises  in pitch to acrescendo. WE pull back and:THE BOOTH EXPLODES. CHOI and the woman are bowled over by the flame.EXT. ALLEY (MATRIX) - DAYThey take  cover from  the blast  as people  all over  the street  areknocked flat.EXT. STREET (MATRIX) - DAYTHE PHONE BOOTH is obliterated.  Miraculously, CHOI and the woman  arestill under the cover of  the jacket. THROWING the smoking  jacket offthem, CHOI screams in agony as  he grasps the smoldering stump of  hisright shoulder. The arm is history.THE WOMAN looks on,  her eyes as wide  as dinner plates. Shaking,  shefalls back, still staring.                                 CHOI                         "You werenít lucky."MORPHEUS, NIOBE, and TRINITY rush to him, picking him up on his  feet.CHOI is  screaming and  laughing. Someone  grabs his  smoldering coat,dragging it along. CHOI stares at the ex-flame as they cart him  away.His eyes are crazy.                                 CHOI              "You still want me to call you? Ha ha ha!"AS they struggle down the street, CHOI starts to walk more on his own.PEOPLE run from the scene, screaming.                        CU - the four of them.MORPHUES looks  at something  off-screen and  frowns. HE  pulls to theleft.                               MORPHEUS                             "This way."TANKS and  TROOPS are  filling into  the street  ahead of them, comingfrom around the corner.THEY turn onto a different  street. This street, too, is  filling withtroops. Worse, itís being lead by AGENT BROWN.                                NIOBE                         "Tanks, or agents?"                               TRINITY                               "Tanks."                                 CHOI                         "Yeah, tanks a lot."They break. CHOI stands on his own, and they run back onto the  streetwith the tanks.CU: TANKSTHREE ABRAMS stop in the  street. Their turrets swing into  place withterrifying quickness and precision.AT ONCE,  they open  fire with  their main  cannons and machines guns.FIRE FLOWERS blaze from the death machines, sending a typhoon of  leaddown the street.  Troops filed between  the tanks pull  their triggersand donít let go. Everything in the street is shredded and blown away,as though it was hit by a high-power pressure hose.WITH UNEARTHLY  SPEED, EVERYONE  BREAKS for  the sides  of the street,except for CHOI. He stands amid  it all as the tracers come  closer tohis body. He raises his machine  gun with his good arm, and  lays intothe enemy.TRACER rounds kick away from  his gun, ripping straight back  into thewall  of soldiers.  His rounds  deflect off  the sloped  armor of  thetanks, recoils pile into the flesh  of troops. He rakes his fire  intothe enemy bodies.CU: CHOITRACERS zoom in on  him. A tank round  blasts by, and the  wall of airkicks him to his side. He continues to fire even as a bullet, followedby  another, blasts  through the  middle of  his body.  More and  morebullets smack into  him, blasting chunks  of meat and  viscera out theback.EXT. STREET (MATRIX) DAYTRINITY and NIOBE  take one side  of the street,  running and shootingsimultaneously. THEY reach  the buildings on  the side and  NIOBE goesSTRAIGHT UP THE FA«ADE OF THE BUILDING, as TRINITY jumps from cover tocover, cart wheeling through tracer fire and bullets.ON  THE  OTHER side  of  the street,  MORPHEUS  goes straight  up  thebuilding  faÁade  and  starts  running  sideways,  completely  defyinggravity, firing downward at the soldiers.CU: CHOIHE WILL NOT FALL, and a hose of lead drills into him, taking his  bodyapart piece by piece. Bullets take away pieces of his head, neck,  andtorso, and in one final wave of fire, he is disintegrated, leaving hismachine gun, barrel  smoking, spinning in  the air, firing  still. Thearm is still attached and finger  clenching on the trigger. It is  thelast piece of CHOI to fall.MORPHEUS climbs  as he  runs. In  mid-stride he  changes magazines andstops, standing on the wall, his body parallel to the ground.On the other side of the street, NIOBE stands on the wall, blazing  atthe mass of troops with two  guns that never cease. THERE is  no coverand  no reprieve  from the  DOUBLE DEATH  from above.  Most are  stillfiring down the street, or over toward TRINITY.TRINITY runs  up the  side of  the street.  Her guns  go empty and shedives behind a stoop as a squad of soldiers blazes away at her.CU: SOLDIERIn slow motion, he  pulls a spoon from  a grenade. Somehow, the  metalring reaches TRINITYíS ears.CU: TRINITYShe slaps a magazine into her  pistol, pulls the action and comes  outfrom under cover just enough to see the soldier releasing the grenade.She fires, hitting the grenade. IT explodes directly over the group ofsoldiers, flattening them to the ground.A  BULLET smacks  through TRINITYíS  wrist, and  the hand  comes off,popping like the head off  a dandelion. Blood spurts from  the severedarteries, spraying the hand, with the pistol still in its grip.ABOVE THE STREET, MORPHEU AND  NIOBE leap for one another.  They catcheach otherís arms, fifty feet  above the surviving enemy, and  spin inplace, firing away. The tank commanders in their copulas blast  upwardwith their  machine guns,  but the  rounds miss  the spinning  couple.MORPHUES and NIOBE concentrate on the commanders, and cut them down.THEY land amidst  the carnage. TRINITY  emerges, shaken, pressing  hercoat to her arm.EXT. STREET (MATRIX) - DAYThe other end of the street fills with soldiers, and AGENT BROWN.CU: AGENT BROWNHE surveys the  scene, and immediately  draws and fires,  running fullbore for the rebels.MORPHEUS, Niobe and TRINITY are too close to the tanks to be fired on,but the nearest one lunges at them. They climb up over concrete stoopsand over  the side  of the  tank. They  sprint down  the street as thetanks turn their turrets behind them, searching.                               MORPHEUS                         "The garage, hurry!"THEY dive behind a corner as  a tank fires. Morpheus throws the  womanforward as the tank round hits  the edge of the building, blowing  theconcrete and brick wall into a massive cloud of powder. Perhaps a  tonof rubble falls on Morpheusí legs. He drags himself forward. Niobe andTrinity grab his arms and haul him out of the rubble. Niobe shoots thelock off a steel door, and they pile into the building.EXT. STREET (MATRIX) - DAYAGENT BROWN  and his  men rush  into position  around the building therebels are hiding in.Suddenly, an unimaginably powerful engine  starts, and as we stare  atthe  garage door,  it explodes  outward. A  jet-black, hyped  COUNTACHexplodes out onto the street, tires literally on fire as they throw upsmoke. It cuts through a few  soldiers, hitting them in the knees,  asit rips up the street, the throttle going way too high.INT. COUNTACH (MATRIX) - DAYTHE street scene spins before them. TRINITY is at the wheel, a  brokenand dusty MORPHEUS sitting next to  her. The tach is redlining as  thecar rips up the street. Pedestrians dive for cover.TRINITY holds her wounded hand to her chest and drives one-handed.                               "Shift."MORPHEUS does so,  and the tires  squeal again when  she releases intosecond, then  third. In  a few  seconds theyíre  over 60  on the  busystreet.EXT. STREET (MATRIX) - DAYSoldiers pick themselves up  just in time to  hear another engine -  asuper powerful track bike, emerges from the burnt rubber smoke screen.A wheely bar on the back of the bike keeps it from flipping around therear tire as it accelerates like a bullet out of a barrel. There isníteven time to take a shot until sheís gone.INT. COUNTACH (MATRIX) - DAYTHEY rocket up the entry to a highway, ripping past cars by driving upthe breakdown lane.  Once they hit  a straightaway Trinity  floors it,and the speedo creeps up past 130 as they dodge in and out of cars.MORPHEUS grabs his twisted, folded legs. He was literally poured  intothe seat. Concentrating, his face knotting in pain, he straightens thebroken, fractured legs. He closes his eyes and concentrates.             The legs reform into straight, strong limbs.                      MORPHEUS grabs the wheel.                               MORPHEUS              "Keep your foot on the gas. Heal thyself."TRINITY pulls her bleeding wound from her arm. Her face tightens,  andshe closes her eyes, fervently concentrating, shutting the world  out,which  is  good,  as  they suffer  constant  close  calls  as Morpheuscontrols the wheel from his awkward spot.When she opens her eyes again, she grabs the wheel. With BOTH hands.MORPHEUS pulls out  his cell and  tries the line.  Itís still full  ofstatic.                               TRINITY                             "Any luck?"                               MORPHEUS               "None. Theyíve killed city-wide comms."                               TRINITY         "Then the agents are out of touch with each other."                               MORPHEUS  "They canít track us, but that gives them more time to destroy ourexits, and find the Neb. Weíll try the desert. Communications might be                        working there still."                               TRINITY                         "What about Niobe?"                               MORPHEUS                    "She knows to meet us there."EXT. HIGHWAY (MATRIX) - DAYNIOBEís bike sizzles down the highway, insanely lane splitting at over100 miles  per hour.  The wheely  bar is  folded up  against the  rearwheel. A dual  stream of vehicles  spit by her  like giant machine-gunbullets. She zooms out of view.EXT. STREET (MATRIX) - DAYGREGORY slows from a run. He looks back as police cars and  ambulancesrace toward  the Metacortex  building. He  canít shake  what heís justwitnessed. He looks forward, only to run into:                             AGENT SMITH             GREGORY freezes, then bursts into questions.                               GREGORY                    "What the fuck just happened?"                                SMITH         "We need you, Gregory. Will you help us stop this?"          GREGORY is perplexed. Resolve comes over his face.                               GREGORY                          "I can stop this?"                                SMITH                                "Yes."                               GREGORY                 "Alright. But how can I fight him?"                                SMITH                "I will give you the power you need."INT. APARTMENT BUILDING (MATRIX) - DAYTHE building is old, crumbling, and inside painted a horrid green thatno sane person could find attractive. The humble place is home to  THEORACLE.NEO exits an  elevator. Recomposed and  dressed normally, he  walks upand down the hall, trying to remember which apartment she lived in.A tall black woman, one of the Oracleís priestesses, comes out of  thestairwell and recognizes NEO.                              PRIESTESS                                "Neo."HE turns  and looks  at her.  She smiles,  but as  Neo looks at her, aflash of uncertainty, and maybe hate, flies across her face before thesmile returns.                              PRIESTESS                 "The Oracle is anxious to see you."NEO follows her into the familiar apartment. The windows are  covered,and NEO and the priestess are the only ones there. The Priestess movesinto the dark kitchen.NEOís eyes  adjust to  the darkness.  He hears  something squish as hesteps, and looks down.The tattered rug  is a swamp  of dark, congealing  liquid. NEO reachesdown and touches it with his fingertips. Itís half-dried blood.He stands, his eyes adjusted to  the dark now. The walls are  chipped,covered in bullet holes.In slow-motion, the entry door to the apartment opens. In walks  AGENTBROWN. NEO turns to the  kitchen. AGENTS SMITH and JONES  appear. Theyall draw their .45s.NEO stands  still as  they walk  up to  him and  put their guns to hishead.                         AGENT SMITH scoffs.                                 NEO "I was on to you the whole time. I only came in here to isolate you,                           to destroy you."                             AGENT JONES                     "What are you waiting for?"                                 NEO              "I realized, that I canít destroy you - "                           HE nods at SMITH                                 NEO              " - without destroying the Matrix itself."                                SMITH                 "You killed me too easy last time."                                BROWN                       "And if you kill us - "                           HE nods at JONES                                BROWN                   "Weíll only come back like him."                         BROWN nods to SMITH.                                 NEO                              "I know."   SMITH breathes deep, and drops his gun. The others follow suit.                                SMITH                "So, why donít you take it all down?"                                 NEO                            "The Matrix?"                                SMITH                                "Yes."                                 NEO  "I can. But if I destroy the Matrix, everyone within it will die."                            SMITH snorts.                                SMITH        "I take it the great Morpheus failed to mention this?"       NEO looks up at him, but his expression doesnít change.                                 NEO                     "How many people are in it?"        SMITH holsters his weapon. He speaks matter-of-factly.                                SMITH                      "Six and a half billion."            FOR NEO, the numbers are too huge to imagine.                            BROWN scoffs.                                BROWN                      "Could you destroy us?"ITíS a serious question for Neo. But he nods. He knows his potential.                                 NEO                              "I could."                                SMITH              "What does that make you feel like? God?"                      HE is amused by the idea.                                JONES        "This is getting tiresome. Where do we go from here?"                                 NEO "IF you cut the power that the Matrix supplies to your armies, Iíll                            let you live."                                SMITH      "Idiot. We donít care about life, we care about victory."                                 NEO                                "Why?"                                JONES                       "So our kind... prevails."                                 NEO                          "You mean, lives."                                SMITH "Who do you think started this war, boy? Your kind tried to kill us                               first."                                BROWN         "But you didnít. Youíre not as tough as you think."                                 NEO                             "Weíll see."THE three agents, helpless to stop him, watch as he walks for the doorof the apartment. NEO opens it,  and stops, his face meeting a  flyingFIST. His vision  FLASHES with the  impact, and he  staggers back intothe room, falling on his ass and rolling back onto his feet.              GREGOR steps into the room, tall and BAD.                         NEO holds up a hand.                                 NEO           "Stop! I donít want to fight you! Youíre human!"GREGORY  doesnít  answer.  He  smashes  a  side-kick  into  NEOís gut,doubling him over.THE kick carries  such an impact  that a pale  concussion wave flashespast Gregor. It sends NEO crashing out the window.GREGORY stands upright and moves to the window, followed by the  threeagents. Thereís nothing on the street, twenty stories below.The building  starts trembling.  We hear  rapid-fire impacts,  growinglouder and coming faster.THE FLOOR EXPLODES  as NEO crashes  up through the  concrete, throwingthe agents away as  he embraces GREGORY in  a bear hug. THEY  blast upthrough the ceiling. WE follow them up through three more floors, bam,bam, bam. Each concrete floor smashes GREGORY in the head.EXT. ROOFTOP (MATRIX) - DAYNEO and GREGORY SMASH through the roof, flying upward, like a missile,past us.EXT. SKY (MATRIX) - DAYCU: NEOHIS FACE is contorted in rage as he rockets upward. GREGORY is  barelyconscious. Seeing this, NEO stops, and flings Gregoryís body violentlyearthward.NEO looks down as  the body falls toward  the city, thousands of  feetbelow. He turns away,  just as the distant  GREGORY is falling out  ofsight. Just before he does, the speck of a person PULLS up, and  growslarger and larger as  it returns. A contrail  streaks behind him as  arips through  the air.  FISTS FORWARD,  GREGORY is  like an MX missilebearing on NEO.NEO turns just in  time to catch BOTH  FISTS in his chest.  Like a cueball striking another billiard,  all Gregorís momentum is  transferredinto Neo. Gregor stops dead in the air as Neo is hurtled out of view.CU: GREGORHE is in  shock somehow as  he sees NEO  flying away. He  clenches hisfists and flexes his body, then looks down.WE see the ground, thousands of feet below.                               GREGORY                             "Holy shit!"FOR some  reason, he  starts to  fall. Even  as he  claws to  maintainaltitude, his  rational mind  has caught  up with  him and  is somehowdenying the fact that he can fly.As heís  facing the  ground, NEO  slams into  him from above. GrippingGregor by the neck and his  belt, he drives straight down. The  groundrushes, it takes  one second to  drop past a  50-story skyscraper. Neoslams  Gregor,  front first,  into  the concrete  sidewalk.  They bustthrough the sidewalk, into the sewer below.INT. SEWER (MATRIX) - DAYNEO stands. Offscreen,  we can here  choking breaths. Neo  looks down.Gregor lies twisted on a concrete slab, impaled multiple times throughthe chest by snapped, rusty rebar.  He takes one last breath, and  hiseyes half-close.NEO checks the pulse. Finding nothing, he leaps out of the hole.CU: GREGORYHIS eyes  blink, and  he follows  NEOís departure.  Choking, unable tobreath with the rebar through him, he writhes.

Performing  a flying  leap kick, Smithgrabs her  and swings  her down,  crashing her  body into the concretewith a sickening crack-thud. She rolls, fighting the pain, as Morpheusflies  back into  action, catching  the agent  with a  furious ass  ofswinging kicks.Niobe grits back the pain and rejoins her love. Together they  assaultthe agent, their speed almost, almost equaling his, their will  cappedby the limits of their Matrix-bending powers. Finally, Smith resurges.He  lands  a punch  into  Niobeís stomach,  and  her body  folds  overunnaturally, as if her back is broken. She crumples to the deck, bloodpouring from her mouth.MORPHEUS screams and brings a hammer blow down on the back of  Smithísneck,  smashing  the  agentís  face  down  and  imprinting  it  in theconcrete. For a  moment, Smith is  still. Morpheus collects  Niobe andruns for the phone booth, which is still ringing.ITíS too far. Smith grabs him around the knees, spilling him  forward.Man handling him like he weighs nothing, Smith gets on top of him  andstarts smashing his fists down into Morpheusí face.                                SMITH          "I should have killed you the first chance I had."Like an enraged silverback, he raises his fists together for one finalblow. But  instead of  striking, his  eyes catch  something. He  flipsback, jumping, as a silver streak cuts through the air, a split secondtoo  slow to  cut the  agentís head  off. Instead,  it slices  cleanlythrough the triceps of the raised arms, leaving nick on the throat.RAZOR, dressed in a black kimono and wielding two katanas, steps  overMorpheus as  he pursues  the agent.  Smith rolls  backwards, gains hisfooting, and retreats from the  swirling blades of death. He  turns toMorpheus:                                RAZOR                                "Go!"INT.

RAZOR              "Come on, tough guy, come got some Razor."SMITH frowns  and moves  forward, but  the whistling  edge of  a blademakes him  think twice.

The sun drops below a cloud.RAZOR flashes  the light  off his  short blade,  directly into Smithíseyes, blinding him as he strikes with the long sword.SMITH, blinded, turns and backs away.

Seeing his chance, heruns back for the ringing  phone. SMITH pursues, almost on  RAZOR whenthe neo-samurai jumps in the  air and pirouhettes, swinging one  swordafter another, like a helicopter blade from Hell.IN the liquid  world of slo-mo,  the short sword  cuts through Smithísoutstretched fingers, sending them  flying. The long sword  grazes hisforearm, cutting through the fabric  and taking off a slice  of flesh.The tip of  the sword slices  through his suit,  cutting his tie  off,digging about an inch into his torso.SMITH collapses into the dust, his  face a mask of blood and  dust. Hedoesnít try to get up.RAZOR passes MORPHEUS, who backs up to the ringing phone booth.  Razorgoes  through first.  MORPHEUS keeps  his eyes  and weapon  locked onSMITH, who  makes no  attempt to  pursue. He  stands calmly,  and in adignified manner, wipes dust off  his clothing as he watches  Morpheusstep into the booth, and replace the phone.It rings. One hand on the receiver, Morpheus stares back at Smith.SMITH stands there, not attempting to pursue. Morpheus pauses,  takingadvantage of the chance to observe his deadly enemy.SMITH stares at the booth for a second. Emotion twists his face, firstanger,  then  perhaps  sadness.  Heís lost.  Heíll  be  in  the Matrixforever.With a quicksilver flash,  his body reverts back  to the shape of  therookie cop.THE young  man is  left standing  there. He  is filthy,  bloody, badlysliced up, and the fingers of one hand are missing. He looks around atthe carnage  as his  mouth simply  opens and  closes, reflexively,  inshock.

You can free us."                                 NEO             "Why me? Why the fuck do I have to do this?"                 MORPHEUS is silent for a long while.INT.
