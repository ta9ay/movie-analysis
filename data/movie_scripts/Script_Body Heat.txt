NIGHT SKYFlames in the night sky. Distant SIRENS. PULLING BACK,we see that the burning building is mostly hidden by dense,black shapes that define the oceanside skyline of MirandaBeach, Florida. We're watching from across town. Thesound of a bathroom SHOWER comes to a dripping stop atabout the same time we see the naked back and head of NEDRACINE. We continue to PULL BACK INTO --RACINE'S APARTMENT - NIGHTRacine, dressed in undershorts, is standing on the smallporch off his apartment on the upper floor of an old house.Racine lights a cigarette and continues to stare off atthe fire. We've passed him now, into the bedroom of theapartment, and the shape of a young woman, ANGELA, flashesby, drying her body with a towel.                          ANGELA (O.S.)           My God, it's hot. I stepped out of           the shower and stared sweating again.           ... It's still burning? Jesus, it's           bigger! And I thought you were making           me hear those sirens.                  (she giggles)           What is it?                          RACINE           The Seawater Inn. My family used to           eat dinner there twenty-five years           ago. Now somebody's torched it to           clear the lot.Angela reappears briefly, gathering her clothes.   Shesits on an unseen bed to get dressed.                             ANGELA (O.S.)           That's a shame.                          RACINE           Probably one of my clients.                             ANGELA (O.S.)           I'm leaving.                          RACINE                  (back still turned)           It's four a.m.On the bed, Angela snaps on her bra.

ANGELA (CONT'D)          I wouldn't mind having breakfast...          What do you care? You're watching          the fire. You're done with me. I'm          just getting into my uniform here...She is, in fact, slipping on the blouse of her Avis Rent-a-Car uniform. There's a smile on her lips as she buttonsup, watching Racine.                         ANGELA          You've had your fun. You're spent.                 (trying for a                  straight face)          I'll just slip into my uniform here          and slip away.                         RACINE          My history's burning up out here.                         ANGELA          Hey, I don't mind. I'm leaving.          Why do they make these damn skirts          so hard to zip...Now, for the first time, Racine turns to look at   her.She is sitting on the edge of the bed, half into   heruniform. Racine smiles broadly at the  sight and   movesinto the room. He pushes her back and  they both   disappearfrom sight, fabric rustling.                         RACINE          Where's your hat?                         ANGELA (O.S.)          Hey... hey...                 (giggling)          ... don't wrinkle it!                         RACINE (O.S.)          'You're spent.' Where'd you hear          that?We are left looking out over the porch at the night. Andwe go back there, across the rooftops, to the flames.INT. COURTROOM - DAYAn Assistant County Prosecutor named PETER LOWENSTEIN hasbeen conferring at the bench with JUDGE COSTANZA and nowthey both wait as Racine comes into view to join them.The Judge is irritated.

JUDGE COSTANZA (CONT'D)          ever actually en route from Indiana          or not. I think we're wasting our          time here. It's pretty clear your          client has attempted to defraud the          county in a not very ingenious manner.                 (he nods at                  Lowenstein)          The Assistant Prosecutor has made          what I consider a generous offer.          And given that you've failed to          generate even the semblance of a          defense --                         RACINE          Judge Costanza, perhaps when I've          presented all --                         JUDGE COSTANZA          Yeah, yeah. If I were you, I'd          recommend to your client that held          quickly do as Mr. Lowenstein here          has suggested -- plead nolo          contendre, file Chapter Eleven and          agree never to do business with          Okeelanta County again.Racine is surprised and pleased.                         RACINE          You would look favorably on that?                         JUDGE COSTANZA                 (nods)          He can walk. But don't test my          patience for even five more minutes.          If he hesitates, I'll nail him.                         RACINE          I'll talk to him.Racine starts to turn.                         JUDGE COSTANZA          Mr. Racine. Next time you come into          my courtroom I hope you've got either          a better defense or a better class          of client.Lowenstein smiles.                         RACINE          Thank you, Your Honor.Racine goes back to his client, a Businessman of enormousconfidence and extravagantly untrustworthy appearance.

Racinedrinks beer while Lowenstein drinks a tall iced tea veryrapidly and signals for another. This place is acrossthe street from the courthouse/police station and thereare plenty of lawyers and cops around, several of whomacknowledge Lowenstein and Racine with pats or nods.A single unit air conditioner is blowing away above thedoor, but it can't compete with the blasts of hot airthat come in with each new patron. All of these people,like the pedestrians outside the window, have strippeddown to essentials In the infernal heat. The lawyers allcarry their Jackets, but even so their shirtsleeves aresweaty. The town is sizzling.                         LOWENSTEIN          -- I think I've underestimated you,          Ned. I don't know why it took me so          long. You've started using your          incompetence as a weapon.                          RACINE                 (smiles)          My defense was evolving. You guys          got scared. Costanza doesn't like          me. What'd I do to him?                          LOWENSTEIN          He's an unhappy man, Thinks he should          be Circuit Court by now. Here he is          in a state with really top-notch          corruption and he's stuck with the          county toilets.                 (he drinks)          I'm surprised you weren't in on that          toilet caper. Could have been that          quick score you've always been          searching for.                          RACINE          Maybe Costanza was in on it.   That's          why he was mad.STELLA, the owner of the coffee shop, writes and placesseparate checks in front of the two men.                         STELLA          What's the word from the hallowed          halls of justice? Anything juicy?                         LOWENSTEIN          Maybe Stella was in on it.

STELLA          You don't like it there's lots of          other places.                         LOWENSTEIN          They don't have you. Gotta go.He stands fishing for change, but Racine takes his checkand places it with his own. Lowenstein nods and moves forthe door.                         LOWENSTEIN          You can't buy me. No sirree, I don't          come cheap.Just before he reaches the door he does a strange thing --he takes several graceful dance steps in the Astairemanner.                         A VOICE          Lowenstein, you're a fag.Lowenstein spins out the door, where he is blasted by theheavy air. His body droops as he disappears.                         STELLA          Why does he do that?                         RACINE          He's pretty good, that's the weird          part.                         STELLA          Did you hear about Dr. Block?                          RACINE          No.   Do I want to?

RACINE                 (the thought                  disgusts him)          That must have been Mrs. Block's          idea, some kind of punishment.                         STELLA          It was! How'd you know? Christ,          you're plugged in better than me.          So you must know about Mrs. Block's          friend in Ocean Grove.Racine winces, gets up, and puts money on the counter.He lights a cigarette.

Things must be slow.Stella agrees with a shrug as Racine heads for the door.                           STELLA          It's the heat.EXT. FIRST STREET AND MAIN STREET - DAYRacine makes his way up First to the corner of Main andcrosses diagonally to his building on Main. He is well-known here, greeted through glass by many of the shopowners. The heat dominates much of the pantomimedconversation. Racine goes in a doorway and heads up thestairs to his office.INT. RACINE'S OFFICE - DAYRacine's secretary, BEVERLY, is behind the desk in themodest reception room. She's a pretty girl barely pasttwenty. She pushes some phone message slips toward Racineand nods toward the sofa. A middle-aged woman client,MRS. SINGER, sits there clutching a walking stick. Herface suddenly is contorted in pain. Racine glancesmeaningfully at Beverly then turns his full solicitouscharm on Mrs. Singer.                         RACINE          Mrs. Singer, I would have gladly          come to the house.He helps her up and leads her slowly to his office.                         MRS. SINGER          No. no, the doctor says I should          walk and I had some shopping. Not          that that quack knows what he's          talking about. I tell you, Mr.          Racine, I'm not sure his testimony          is going to be very useful.                         RACINE          Don't worry about it. I'll find you          a doctor who's more understanding.          Is it bad today?                         MRS. SINGER          Oooh, you can't imagine. Nothing          can make up for the pain they've          caused me.                         RACINE          How well I know. We'll sue those          reckless bastards dry. Excuse my          language.    Converted to PDF by www.screentalk.org                 7.As Mrs. Singer disappears into the office, Racine flashesa grin at Beverly.                         MRS. SINGER          Don't apologize. That's the kind of          attitude you've got to have these          days...EXT. THE BEACHFRONT - NIGHTThe hottest January in fifty years has brought the crowdsto the beach in search of relief. But they've beendisappointed. Even the breeze off the ocean seems blownfrom a hair dryer. Still, the nights are a trifle betterand the Beachfront, the penny arcades, the ice cream standsand bars are busy, even now in the middle of the week.Racine comes out of a bar and lights a cigarette, idlywatching the passing parade. There is a free band concertin progress at the band shell. Racine wanders in thatdirection.EXT. THE BAND SHELL - NIGHTThe Miranda Beach High School Orchestra is playing to afull, sweating house; the audience is a sea of orangeprograms fluttering away as fans. People come and gofrequently.The atmosphere is as innocent and informal as the musicthe band is playing now.Racine leans against the back rail, smoking, his eyesplaying over the scene with no expectations.Then, down near the center aisle, a WOMAN rises. As theband plays on, this extraordinary, beautiful woman, in asimple white dress, moves down the aisle. She moveswonderfully. The dress clings to  her body in the heat.Racine watches, mesmerized, as she walks directly towardhim. She passes within a few inches of him, her eyeslowered. Racine's body sways a moment as she goes by, asthough buffeted by some force. But they do not touch.She goes out onto the Beachfront walkway.EXT. THE BEACHFRONT WALKWAY - NIGHTThe Woman, MATTY, has walked to the rail. She standsthere now lighting a cigarette. She presents her faceto the ocean, hoping for a breeze.    We move in on her,with Racine.Racine lights a new cigarette and smiles at her. Shelooks at him and, for an instant, her eyes race over hisbody, then she looks back at the ocean.

RACINE          You can stand here with me if you          want, but you'll have to agree not          to talk about the heat.She looks at him, and there is something startling aboutthe directness of her gaze. When she speaks, she is coolwithout being hostile.                         MATTY          I'm a married woman.                            RACINE          Meaning what?                         MATTY          Meaning I'm not looking for company.She turns back toward the ocean.                         RACINE          Then you should have said -- 'I'm a          happily married woman.'                         MATTY          That's my business.

MATTY          I wondered. Thought maybe I was out          of touch.She stops again at the rail as a small breeze blows infrom the ocean. She turns her back to it and, with hercigarette dangling from her lips, she uses both hands tolift her hair up off her nape. She closes her eyes asthe air hits her. Racine watches very closely.                         RACINE          How 'bout I buy you a drink?                         MATTY          I told you. I've got a husband.

RACINE'S OFFICE - DAYRacine is behind the desk. Occupying the two seats infront are a married couple rapidly approaching divorce.They are arguing now, each trying to convince Racine oftheir view. Racine nods occasionally, looking from oneto the other. But he is also looking between them, throughthe open door out to the reception room, where hissecretary Beverly is kneeling before the lowest drawer ofa filing cabinet.

He's feeling lucky as he watches up ahead.RACINE'S POV out the windshield. Matty's shiny Mercedes450 SEL is gliding down the road ahead of him. She putson the blinker, slows and turns into a gated drive. Thedrive is canopied by heavy trees, the vegetation crowdingthe road with a primeval lushness.

Beyond it,the waterway is shimmering in the moonlight. At the edgeof the water is a small boat house.Racine walks along under the chimes, looking up at them.A smile plays across her face.

People drag by, makingtheir way home from work in the heat. Finally, Racinehangs up.Racine comes out of the phone booth. He has nowhere togo. He ambles down the street. A few people say hello.He walks diagonally across the street toward a restaurantcalled "Tulio's."INT. TULIO'S RESTAURANT - DUSKThe best restaurant in Miranda Beach. Racine slips onhis jacket as he comes in the door. He waves to theHostess across the dining room, indicating he'll be alonetonight. She signals a short wait.

Nice to meet you.                         MATTY          Mr. Racine is the lawyer I told you          about.                 (Walker doesn't                  remember)          You remember. He had a client who          wanted to buy the house. I told him          we weren't selling.                           WALKER          Right.                         RACINE          That hasn't changed, has it?                         WALKER          No, we're very happy with it.                          RACINE                 (nods)          I can understand that.    It's a          terrific place.Walker nods, looking at Racine carefully.    He motionstoward the dining room.                         WALKER          Are you going in?                         RACINE          I was just going to grab a bite.                           WALKER          Join us.

Walker hastaken off his glasses and is cleaning the lenses with alovely handkerchief. He does this cleaning with enormouscare and inordinate relish. His manner is a mix of gruffcharm and hinted menace. There's something dangerousabout the man and it's perfectly distilled in his smile,which is quick, frequent and vaguely threatening.                         WALKER          I was a lawyer. Still am, I guess.          But I don't practice. Went to          Columbia. You?                            RACINE          F. S. U.                            WALKER                 (nods)          Good school.  I got bored with it          quick. I guess I didn't have the          temperament.  I wanted to make the          money faster.  Is there a living in          it here?                         RACINE          I can afford to send my shirts out.          And eat here once a month, if I don't          order an appetizer.Walker smiles, re-folds his handkerchief carefully andputs it back in the cheat pocket of his jacket.                         WALKER          I figured an honest lawyer doesn't          make much and the other kind was too          slimy for me. I'd rather be upfront          about shafting somebody.                            MATTY          Edmund, really.     It's Mr. Racine's          profession.                         RACINE          That's all right. I don't like it          much.                         WALKER          What's to like. That's the way of          the world. Most people despise their          jobs.

RACINE          Do you?                            WALKER          No. I love it.     But it's not a job.                         RACINE          What is it, exactly?Walker signals to a distant Waiter for another bottle ofwine. He does it with a small flick of his finger.                            WALKER          Various things.     This and that.          Here and there.                         RACINE          You don't have to be specific.                         WALKER                 (that smile again)          Finance, basically. Venture capital,          Investments, real estate. We're          into a few things.                          RACINE          Yeah?   Around here?                          WALKER          Some.   We own some things here.                         MATTY          Edmund's company owns The Breakers.                            RACINE          Is that right?For a second, Walker's eyes flick over Matty like a whip.                         WALKER          It's not that simple. We have an          interest in a few places along the          shore. For the land. You know.          Someday. There's no explaining it          to her.                         MATTY                 (to Racine)          I'm too dumb. Woman, you know.She picks up her purse and stands up with a good-humoredsmile. The men rise.                         MATTY          I'll be right back.

They sit.                         WALKER          She's something, isn't she?                           RACINE                 (nods)          A lovely lady.                         WALKER          Yes, she is. I'm crazy about her.          If I ever thought she was seeing          another guy... I don't know.                 (he takes a sip of                  wine)          I'd understand how it could happen.          Her being the way she is. I'd          understand it. But I think I'd kill          the guy with my bare hands.                         RACINE          That's understanding.Walker looks at Racine and laughs. As he begins to speak,he focuses intently on Racine. He seems to be trying tocommunicate something other than what he's saying.                         WALKER          You wouldn't believe the dorkus she          was with when I met her. The guy          came to us with a business          proposition. We're always looking          for opportunities. If the conditions          are right. We're willing to take an          occasional risk, if the downside          isn't too steep. But this guy hadn't          done his homework, he didn't know          the bottom line. That's how I knew          he was full of shit. You've got to          know the bottom line. That's all          that really counts.Again Walker takes off his glasses. He holds them up tothe light and then rubs them again with his handkerchief.                         WALKER          He didn't have the goods,  this guy.          He was like a lot of guys  you run          into -- they want to get  rich, they          want to do it quick, they  want to be          there with one score.He puts his glasses back on, stares at Racine.

Do you know what I mean?Racine looks at him in silence for a moment.                        RACINE          I'm not sure. You mean, lay the          groundwork? Earn it?                         WALKER          No. I mean do what's necessary.          Whatever's necessary.The two men stare at each other a few beats.                         RACINE          Yeah. I know that kind of guy. I          can't stand that. It makes me sick.                            WALKER          Me too.                         RACINE          I'm not like that.Walker ROARS with laughter.

All aroundhim are the tools and supplies of his trade: wire, rope,cans, vises, alarm clocks, chemical containers, and ahuge assortment of mechanical implements. He keeps allhis small accessories in dozens of cigar boxes, unlabeled.    Converted to PDF by www.screentalk.org             52.He knows where everything Is. Teddy is watching Racine,who is kneeling on the floor before a compact incendiarydevice. Teddy winces at the way Racine clips two wirestogether. He reaches over to turn down the tape slightly,then squats down next to Racine to demonstrate the propermethod.                          TEDDY          Whatsa matter, you can't think with          a little music?                 (demonstrating)          Like this, I said.Racine nods then duplicates the clipping. Teddy goesback to his stool, slapping the beat of the music on histhigh. Racine pulls out the alarm lever on the clockattached to the device and stands up.

It starts big          and it'll go with just the mag clips.          If you want more, splash a little          accelerator around.

MATTY          I don't know why he's so crazy about          her. Maybe because he never had any          of his own. She's a cute little          girl, all right, but other than          that...

RACINE'S APARTMENT - NIGHTThe lights are out. There's enough moonlight pouring inthe open windows to see Racine sitting on the bed in hisshorts, his back propped against some pillows at theheadboard. A fan WHIRS on a table. He lights anothercigarette and takes another drink; a bottle of bourbonsits on his nightstand. From where he sits, he can seethe ocean. There is a KNOCK at the door.                            RACINE          Yeah?                            MATTY (O.S.)          It is me.                            RACINE          It's open.Matty comes in.  She peers into the darkness until shesees him. She  locks the door and turns to face him.

MATTY          I don't know what Heather will tell          Roz. Maybe nothing. Maybe she'll          be embarrassed or afraid. Maybe          she'll think she imagined the whole          thing.

HARDIN (CONT'D)                 (to Racine)          As I've told Mrs. Walker, I was more          than a little surprised by the          existence of this new will. Edmund          hadn't mentioned anything about it          to me.Hardin looks at Racine a beat, but Racine has nothing tosay.                          HARDIN          Mrs. Walker explained to me that          when she and her husband decided to          make some minor changes, they just          took care of it up here for          simplicity's sake. And, indeed, as          you know, the new will is almost          identical to the old but for the          disposition of a few items.                  (to the group in                   general)          At the risk of oversimplifying, the          thrust of the will is to divide the          estate in almost equal parts between          Heather Kraft and Mrs. Walker. Would          you agree with that assessment, Mr.          Racine?Racine nods.                          HARDIN          Mmmm. And you witnessed the    signing          by Edmund Walker along with   this          Miss --                  (glancing at papers                   on the desk)          -- Mary Ann Simpson on July   twenty-          first.

RACINE          I'm confused, too. Do you have a          problem with the witnessing or the          signatures? What is it you're getting          at?                         HARDIN                 (almost wistful)          No, there doesn't seem to be any          problem here. This is Edmund Walker's          last will and testament. I'm afraid          the problem is elsewhere.He reaches into his coat and brings out a gold cigar case.                         HARDIN          Would anyone mind if I smoked?No one does. In fact, Racine, Matty and Roz allimmediately produce their own packs of cigarettes. Theeffect is comical and everyone in the room laughs at thegroup reflex.

HARDIN (CONT'D)          In writing the will, I'm afraid Mr.          Racine violated what's known as "the          rule against perpetuities.Hardin watches Racine, who reacts minutely.                         HARDIN          It's a small thing, but it's the          law. It forbids an inheritance to          be passed down indefinitely for          generations. Many general          practitioner lawyers don't fully          understand it. It doesn't come up          much for them, because wills this          complex are usually handled by estate          departments in larger firms. Handled          by lawyers who specialize in this          type of work.Matty turns a confused look to Roz who returns itsympathetically. Hardin notes it.                           HARDIN          I know this is terribly confusing,          but if you'll bear with me... I          spotted the problem right away, but          since Edmund's intent was clear, I          thought it in everyone's best interest          to try and get the will admitted          into probate anyway, even though it          was technically incorrect. I knew          that a probate judge in Miami would          spot the mistake right away. That's          all they do all day, they're expert.          So I thought I'd bring it up here to          Okeelanta County -- since Edmund had          the residence here -- and see if I          could get lucky with a judge who          didn't know estate law quite so          well...

Lowenstein can't help a small,wincing smile. Now Hardin gets to his payoff and thereis no amusement in his tone.                         HARDIN          Unfortunately, my plan backfired. I          ran into a judge who'd had other          dealings with Mr. Racine. A Judge          Costanza.

But on a will Mr. Racine          prepared. It was quite a mess.          Accusations of carelessness, a          malpractice suit...

GRACE                 (to Racine)          Listen, you probably don't want to          see the Kraft woman right now. She's          a little wild. Why don't you slip          out the back way here?Racine looks first at Lowenstein, then at Grace.                         RACINE          Are we done here?

And he and          your friend are going at something          which Heather couldn't quite figure          out.Lowenstein begins to shake with laughter; he almost fallsoff the stool.

She's never          seen one angry before. But it made          quite an impression on her.          Yessirree! That's all she can          remember.Lowenstein starts to choke with laughter.

(he laughs again)          Can you imagine poor Heather? She          hustled back to bed after getting a          gander at that. And listen to why          she got up in the first place, this          is the capper. She had a nightmare!

RACINE          They had to be here when you cleaned          up that night. Think about it, think          hard. They've probably got my prints          on them.                          MATTY          I must have missed them. I wasn't          looking for them. I thought they          were on Edmund.                         RACINE          So where could they have gone?                         MATTY          I don't know.                 (suddenly, a look)          Betty!

MATTY          Listen to me. That's why I fired          her. After Edmund's death she started          acting strange. She was always          watching me, listening to my calls.                         RACINE          That's crazy. You imagined it. I          know, I've been imagining things,          too. Plenty.                         MATTY          No, Ned, not with her I wasn't. I          could tell there was a difference.          Maybe she know about us. Maybe she          wants something.                         RACINE          Don't you think we would have heard          from her by now?Matty walks over and sits at the bottom of the steps.She looks up at him.                         MATTY          I don't know what to think. I'm          worried. But it's not about the          glasses. Or your friends. It's us.                           RACINE          I'm sorry.                         MATTY          Your first reaction is to accuse me.          What's happening to you?

Racine is backedinto a corner. He watches them, as though from a distance.He looks different from them.INT. LOBBY - SKYSCRAPER - DAYThe lawyers pile out of the elevator. A few carrybriefcases. Racine finally appears. He too carries abriefcase. He looks across the huge lobby at the entranceto a restaurant/bar.INT. RESTAURANT/BAR - SKYSCRAPER - DAYRacine sits at the bar with a drink. Once more, he glancesdiagonally to the end of the bar, at a guy in a three-piece suit. The guy seems to be looking at Racine wheneverhe isn't watching the front entrance. Finally the guy cancontrol himself no longer. He picks up his drink and walksaround the bar to the space next to Racine. His name isMICHAEL GLENN and he's bright, successful and irritating.The two men are on the edge of remembering each other.                         GLENN          We know each other, don't we?                 (Racine smiles,                  uncertain)          I'm Michael Glenn. With Bashford,          Hillerman.The smile fades from Racine's face.                           RACINE          Ned Racine.It comes back to Glenn in a flash. He wishes he hadn'tcome up.

(embarrassed,                  indicates the                  entrance)          I'm just meeting some people.Racine nods. Glenn looks him over, smiles; he'singratiating.                         GLENN          Hey, this is silly. You're not still          mad about that Gourson business?                 (Racine shrugs,                  takes a drink)          We had to do it. Costanza practically          insisted we sue you. Listen, nobody          at our place likes malpractice against          other lawyers.                           RACINE          Forget it.Glenn remembers something. He smiles confidentially.                         GLENN          I tried to make it up to you.Racine looks at him blankly.                         GLENN          Did you ever meet a lady named Matty          Walker? You'd remember her. A very          hot number.                           RACINE          Matty Walker?                         GLENN                 (glances at the                  entrance)          Yeah. I met her at a party. She said          she was going up there and she wanted          to know about lawyers. I gave her          your name.                           RACINE          When was this?                         GLENN                 (trying to remember)          I don't know... long time.

GLENN                  (a slimy grin)           Hey, I was trying to get you work.He starts to move away. Racine grabs him by his tie andpulls him back hard. The people nearby turn in alarm.Racine speaks very quietly to the startled Glenn.                          RACINE           Did you tell her about Gourson?                          GLENN           Jesus, are you nuts?Racine twists his grip on Glenn's tie. Glenn starts tochoke.                          GLENN           Maybe I told her how we met. Yeah,           maybe.Racine lets him go.EXT. FRONT OF WALKER HOUSE - DUSKRacine's Stingray tears up the drive and SQUEALS to astop in the parking area. Racine looks at the house fromthe car.

It's a thing in          Lauderdale. Something must've gone          wrong, but they're not telling me.          I'm a little worried.

She said you told her          how to reach me, I figured you musta,          she knew all about it.

The curtains havebeen carefully drawn across it; it is impossible to seebeyond them into the boathouse. Except... except for onelittle slice at the bottom of the window where the curtainsare held apart a fraction of an inch by something. Racinecrouches down to look through the crack.WHAT RACINE SEES. The curtains are being held apart thislittle bit by a wire. A wire which is attached to thewindow and runs tautly back into the gloom of theboathouse. Racine shifts his head an inch and he can seeanother wire. It originates from that same spot back inthe gloom and runs toward the door, although Racine, withthis limited view, cannot actually see where the wire isattached.

It's not justthat he's very tired. The hardness is going out of hislook. As the seconds tick by, and Matty does not reappear,he begins to lose faith in his view of the world. He beginsto be afraid. Afraid for Matty. Even now.A sudden breeze starts the wind chimes TINKLING loudly.                         RACINE          No, Matty! Stop! Don't go in! Matty.Racine breaks into a run, dropping the revolver on thegrass. He has taken two big strides when --There is a sound like the ROAR of a dragon, and the roofof the boathouse lifts and then disappears in a huge BALLOF FLAME. The air is  sucked around Racine's body, whippingat his clothes, as he stumbles on the lawn and fallsforward.Grace steadies himself against the side of the gazebo.Racine knows horror. He struggles to his feet and stumblestoward the fire. His body is silhouetted against theleaping, ROARING flames in the night sky.                                       SLOW DISSOLVE TO:INT.

His eyes snap open wide;he is totally and instantly awake. He talks to himself,with true amazement.                         RACINE          She's alive.INT. VISITORS CENTER - FLORIDA STATE PENITENTIARY - DAYGrace sits on the other side of the glass from Racine.They talk on telephones. Grace's eyes are sad; they sayhe thinks Racine is going crazy.                         RACINE          But what if that was someone else's          body in there? What if it was already          there when I got there -- dead and          waiting for me. Maybe her friend...          Mary Ann.                         GRACE          Her teeth were left, man. We sent          them back to Illinois. The          identification was positive. That          was her, that was Matty Tyler Walker.          That was her and she's dead.                         RACINE          You're not listening to me. What if          she's been using this other girl's          name? Since she met Walker three          years ago, since she first spotted          him and decided to take him... one          way or another. Maybe Walker -- or          any of us -- never knew her real          name.                         GRACE          Why would she want to hide her          identity?                         RACINE          I don't know. Maybe there was          something in her past, something so          bad she was afraid it would queer it          with Walker if he found out -- that          he'd never marry her.Grace is unreceptive to this. But Racine is charged.                         RACINE          Let's say she's living as the other          girl, this girl from her past. Someone          whose history she knew and could use          any way she wanted. And there's only          one person in the world who knows          the truth.

RACINE (CONT'D)                 (he leans in)          And then just when Matty's got me on          the line, when she's finally going          to collect, that one person shows          up. That girl. Finds her. And          threatens to expose her. So Matty          starts paying her off. Maybe she          even promises to cut her in on          Edmunds' money. Now she's got to          share it with two people.Racine peaks, tapping the glass between them as though itwere all there for Grace to see.                         RACINE          But when Matty sees a way to get rid          of both of them at once. A way to          solve all her problems and get clear,          with no one looking for her. At the          boathouse. You find two bodies, me          and this girl. Two killers dead.          Case closed.Oscar isn't buying.                         RACINE          You can't find the money, can you,          Oscar? Doesn't that tell you          something?                            GRACE          It tells    me she moved it and we can't          find it.    And that don't mean shit.          It could    be sittin' in any bank in          the world    waiting for a dead lady to          come for    it.Racine, calmer now, shakes his head "no."                         GRACE          Do you hear what you're saying? It's          crazy. This Matty would've had to          been one quick, smart broad.Racine confirms Grace's fears with a look that can onlybe called half-crazed. There's the glimmer of a ruefulsmile.                         RACINE          Oscar, don't you understand? That          was her special gift she was          relentless.                 (much quieter)          Matty was the kind of person who          could do what was necessary. Whatever          was necessary.

GRACE          Racine, you got to face something.          You killed Edmund Walker, man. And          you're going down for it. Two people          are dead. And no matter how you want          to figure it, you ain't bringin'          either of 'em back to life.Grace gives him a long look, then hangs up the phone. Hestands up and walks away.

A Trustee hands through a book-size manilaenvelope, which has been neatly opened by the prisonauthorities. Racine looks at the return address and becomesvery intense.
