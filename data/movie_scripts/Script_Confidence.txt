So I'm dead...FADE IN:EXT. - BACK ALLEY- NIGHT (PRESENT)Dumpsters overflow with the day's garbage. A pillar ofsteam rises from an underground grate. It's the darkplace between buildings that a reasonable person avoids.We see JAKE VIG, a guy in his late 20's whose fashionablesuit and good looks are in obvious contrast to thesurroundings-- At first glance, you'd think he could runfor Congress some day.  At first glance.Jake faces a garbage dumpster on his knees, executionstyle. His face gives away nothing-- He could be kneelingin a strawberry field.                       JAKE (V.O.)

BUTCH (O.S.)           No. I'm not the Anti-Christ. Or the           Prince of Darkness. I'm just a guy           looking for some answers.There's the LOUD UNMISTAKABLE "CLICK" of a gun beingcocked. The barrel of a gun slides gently along Jake'sear and comes to rest at the base of his skull.The voice and the gun belong to BUTCH (40's). With hissuit and conservative looks, you'd make him out for a"Steve" or "Roger" more than a "Butch".                       BUTCH (cont' d)           Things are probably going to end badly           for you, Jake.                       JAKE           Gee... What makes you say that?

He          starts looking for Lily, Lupus, Gordo--                      MILES          But the best part was that he couldn't          find Gordo! He was in the bathroom.

(off Ashby's nod)             Have you ever heard of a company called             Big.Com?                          ASHBY             Big.Com.

The guys who started that did             what a lot of companies in the Valley             do. They get a good idea, shop it             around, raise some capital, then sell             it off to a bigger company. Microsoft,             Intel, Oracle, whatever. The beauty of             it is, they've pretty much sold the             company before they're even real. The             bigger company is already set to buy             it, all they want to do is make sure             that the idea actually works. So they             get some start up capital, make it work,             then sell it for like five times the             initial loan.                         ASHY             Sort of like a letter of intent.                         JAKE             Exactly. But the Catch-22 is that you             can't tell anyone about the offer,             because if it's public, you could start             a bidding war and that's considered a             breach of etiquette. It could kill a             deal. But, wait too long and you're             not considered hot anymore.
