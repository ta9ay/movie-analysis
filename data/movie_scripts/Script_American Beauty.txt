And then, Connie Cardullo told me he his          parents had to put him in a mental          institution.                    JANE          Why? What did he do?

JANE          Thanks, but I really don't need to have          some psycho obsessing about me right now.                    RICKY          I'm not obsessing. I'm just curious.He looks at her intently, his eyes searching hers. Jane isunnerved and has to look away. Ricky smiles and walks off.                    ANGELA          What a freak. And why does he dress like          a Bible salesman?

RICKY          It was one of those days when it's a          minute away from snowing. And there's          this electricity in the air, you can          almost hear it, right? And this bag was          just... dancing with me. Like a little          kid begging me to play with it. For          fifteen minutes. That's the day I          realized that there was this entire life          behind things, and this incredibly          benevolent force that wanted me to know          there was no reason to be afraid.
