THE PRIVATE LIFE OF SHERLOCK HOLMES                by  Billy Wilder and I.A.L DiamondTHE PRIVATE LIFE OF SHERLOCK HOLMESFADE IN:BRASS PLAQUE - DAYEngraved on it are the words: COX & CO., Bankers.Reflected in its shiny surface are double-decker redbuses, and other present-day London traffic.INT. BANK VAULT - DAYAn iron gate opens, and two bank guards come in. One ofthem switches on the lights. On the shelves which linethe walls are dusty strong-boxes, document cases, wrappedpackages, etc. The guards move along the shelvessearching for something.                        WATSON'S VOICE           Somewhere in the vaults of a bank in           London is a tin dispatch box with my name           on it. It is not to be opened until           fifty years after my death.The guards find a battered tin dispatch box with the nameJOHN H. WATSON, M.D., painted on it. They remove it fromthe shelf, set it down on a table. The box is tied withheavy cord, the knots sealed with wax. Strung on thecord is the key.                        WATSON'S VOICE           It contains certain mementos of my long           association with a man who elevated the           science of deduction to an art -- the           world's first, and undoubtedly most           famous, consulting detective.While one of the guards dusts the box off, the other cutsthe cord with a pair of scissors. He then inserts thekey in the lock, turns it, raises the lid -- revealingthe dusty contents of the box.OVER THIS, SUPERIMPOSE THE MAIN TITLE.The guards now start to remove the objects from the box,one at a time: -- A daguerreotype of Holmes, standing,and Watson, seated, in a a stiff studio pose; Holmes'deerstalker hat, his curved pipe, his magnifying glass;Watson's stethoscope, Holmes' revolver; a small enamelsign with the number 221B; a pair of handcuffs;                                                          2.a sheet of music paper which is unrolled to disclose aviolin piece composed by Holmes, titled FOR ILSE von H.;A pocket watch, the back of which is opened to reveal aphotograph of Gabrielle Valladon; a signet ring bearingthe initials S.H. -- under which is concealed a compass;a worn morocco case -- inside which is an early-modelhypodermic syringe; a crystal ball which, when shaken,produces a snowstorm - and when the snow settles, we seea bust of Queen Victoria.OVER THESE OBJECTS, THE REST OF THE CREDIT TITLES ARESUPERIMPOSED.The last item out of the box   is a thick stack ofmanuscript paper, bound with   green ribbon. The guardundoes the ribbon, dusts off   the top page, as CAMERAMOVES IN CLOSER.  Written in   ink, in the cursivepenmanship of the period, is   the following paragraph:          To my heirs:          In my lifetime, I have recorded some          sixty cases demonstrating the singular          gift of my friend Sherlock Holmes --          dealing with everything from The Hound of          the Baskervilles to his mysterious          brother Mycroft and the devilish          Professor Moriarty. But there were other          adventures which, for reasons of          discretion, I have decided to withhold          from the public until this much later          date. They involve matters of a delicate          and sometimes scandalous nature, as will          shortly become apparent.OVER THIS, WE HEAR THE VOICE OF DR. WATSON, reading thetext.                                               DISSOLVE TO:YORKSHIRE LANDSCAPE - DAYA passenger train of the late Nineteenth Century ischugging through the early morning mist.                       WATSON'S VOICE          It was August of 1887, and we were          returning from Yorkshire, where Holmes          had solved the baffling murder of Colonel          Abernetty.                                                         3.INT. COMPARTMENT - MOVING TRAIN - DAWNThere are but two passengers in the compartment --sitting by the window, facing each other. In fact theyare dozing. One wears a deerstalker and an Invernesscape; the other is in a dark overcoat and a black bowler,a furled umbrella between his legs, a medical bag on theseat beside him. The rest of their luggage is on theracks above. They are, of course, SHERLOCK HOLMES andDR. JOHN H. WATSON. This being 1887, they are thirty-three and thirty-five respectively.                          WATSON'S VOICE             You may recall that he broke the             murderer's alibi by measuring the depth             to which the parsley had sunk in the             butter on a hot day.                                                DISSOLVE TO:EXT. BAKER STREET - DAYA hansom cab, with Holmes' and Watson's luggage strappedto the rack on top, is proceeding down the busy street.                          WATSON'S VOICE             He was the most brilliant man I have ever             known -- and I dare say people have             envied me for sharing that flat with him             in Baker Street.The cab draws up   in front of 221B. The front door opensand MRS. HUDSON,   a plump, motherly woman in her fifties,wearing an apron,   hurries down the steps. She greetsHolmes and Watson   warmly as they alight.                          WATSON'S VOICE             I'll grant you he was stimulating -- but             he could also be moody, unpredictable,             egocentric, and more often than not,             completely infuriating -- as our             landlady, Mrs. Hudson, can attest --             bless her kind soul.The cabbie   starts to unload their luggage. As Holmes,Watson and   Mrs. Hudson proceed inside, CAMERA TRAVELS UPTHE FACADE   OF THE BUILDING, past the number 221B, to thebay window   on the second floor.                                                         4.INT. LIVING ROOM - 221B BAKER STREET - DAYIt's all there -- the fireplace, the coal scuttle, thePersian slipper with the tobacco; the velvet wing chair,the basket chair with the writing-arm, the couch with thecushions; the sideboard with the tantalus and thegasogene; the acid-stained deal-topped table with Holmes'chemical equipment on it, the dining table, the smallMoorish table; the bookshelves and the violin case; thegas fixtures and the oil lamps; the dumbwaiter connectingwith the kitchen in the basement; and Holmes' desk, piledhigh with papers, clippings, research material, etc.Holmes is pulling up the window shades. Watson hasremoved his hat and coat, and is putting his medical bagdown on the sideboard; the cabbie, having deposited theirluggage, is just leaving.                       MRS. HUDSON          I do wish you'd give me a little more          warning when you come home unexpected.    I          would have roasted a goose -- and had          some flowers for you.                       HOLMES          My dear Mrs. Hudson -- criminals are as          unpredictable as head-colds. You never          quite know when you're going to catch          one.He has picked up a dagger, starts opening his mail, whichis on the dining table.                       MRS. HUDSON          I'll unpack your bags.She exits into one of the bedrooms.   Watson has now takena magazine out of an envelope.                       WATSON          Here's an advance copy of Strand          Magazine.                 (shows it to Holmes)          They've printed 'The Red-Headed League!'On the cover is a colored illustration from the story,featuring in obligatory Inverness and deerstalker.                                            5.             HOLMES       (offhand)Very impressive.             WATSON       (leafing through the        magazine)Would you like to see how I treated it?             HOLMESI can hardly wait. I'm sure I'll findout all sorts of fascinating things aboutthe case that I never knew before.             WATSONJust what do you mean by that?             HOLMESOh, come now, Watson, you must admit thatyou have a tendency to over-romanticize.You have taken my simple exercises inlogic and embellished them, exaggeratedthem...             WATSONI deny the accusation.             HOLMESYou have described me as six-foot-four,whereas I am barely six-foot-one.             WATSONA bit of poetic license.             HOLMES       (removing Inverness and        deerstalker)You have saddled me with this improbablecostume, which the public now expects meto wear.             WATSONThat's not my doing.       (indicating cover of Strand)Blame it on the illustrator.             HOLMESYou've made me out to be a violinvirtuoso. Here --                                            6.       (holds out a letter he's been        reading)-- a request from the Liverpool Symphonyto appear as soloist in the MendelssohnConcerto.             WATSON       (excited)Oh, really?             HOLMESThe fact is that I could barely hold myown in the pit orchestra of a second-ratemusic hall.             WATSONYou're much too modest.             HOLMES       (busy with the mail)You have given the reader the distinctimpression that I am a misogynist.Actually, I don't dislike women -- Imerely distrust them. The twinkle in theeye and the arsenic in the soup.             WATSONIt's those little touches that make youcolorful --             HOLMESLurid is more like it. You have paintedme as a hopeless dope addict -- justbecause I occasionally take a five percent solution of cocaine.             WATSONA seven per cent solution.             HOLMESFive per cent. Don't you think I'm awareyou've been diluting it behind my back?             WATSONAs a doctor -- and as your friend -- Istrongly disapprove of this insidioushabit of yours.                                                      7.                       HOLMES          My dear friend -- as well as my dear          doctor -- I only resort to narcotics when          I am suffering from acute boredom -- when          there are no interesting cases to engage          my mind.                 (holding out one of the open                  letters)          Look at this -- an urgent appeal to find          six missing midgets.He tosses the letter down is disgust.                       WATSON          Did you say midgets?He picks up the letter.                       HOLMES          Six of them -- the Tumbling Piccolos --          an acrobatic act with some circus.                       WATSON          Disappeared between London and Bristol          ... Don't you find that intriguing?                       HOLMES          Extremely so. You see, they are not only          midgets -- but also anarchists.                          WATSON          Anarchists?                       HOLMES                 (nodding)          By now they have been smuggled to Vienna,          dressed as little girls in burgundy          pinafores. They are to greet the Czar of          all the Russias when he arrives at the          railway station. They will be carrying          bouquets of flowers, concealed in each          bouquet will be a bomb with a lit fuse.                       WATSON          You really think so?                       HOLMES          Not at all. The circus owner offers me          five pounds for my services -- that's not          even a pound a midget.                                                          8.          So obviously he is a stingy blighter, and          the little chaps simply ran off to join          another circus.                         WATSON                   (crestfallen)          Oh.    And it sounded so promising --                       HOLMES          There are no great crimes anymore,          Watson. The criminal class has lost all          enterprise and originality. At best they          commit some bungling villainy, with a          motive so transparent that even a          Scotland Yard official can see through          it.He has crossed to the desk, suddenly notices something.                       HOLMES                 (angrily)          Mrs. Hudson!                 (even angrier)          MRS. HUDSON!Mrs. Hudson comes hurrying out of the bedroom.                         MRS. HUDSON          Yes?    What is it? What have I done now?                       HOLMES                 (sternly)          There is something missing from my desk.                        MRS. HUDSON          Missing?                       HOLMES          Something very crucial.                 (picks up a small feather)          You have been tidying up against my          explicit orders.                       MRS. HUDSON          Oh, I made sure not to disturb anything.                       HOLMES          Dust, Mrs. Hudson, is an essential part          of my filing system. By the thickness of          it, I can date any document immediately.                                                       9.                       MRS. HUDSON          Some of the dust was this thick.She demonstrates with her thumb and forefinger.                       HOLMES                 (promptly)          That would be March, 1883.He blows the feather away.                                             DISSOLVE TO:INT. LIVING ROOM - EVENINGSTART on Holmes' foot, operating a bellows. CAMERA PANSUP to the top of the chemistry table, on which anelaborate apparatus of brass, glass and rubber tubing hasbeen set up. Inserted into the ends of the rubber tubesare half a dozen cigarettes, four cigars of differentshapes and colors, and four pipes, all lit. Activated bythe bellows, they are puffing away like mad, wheezingloudly and filling the screen with smoke. Seated at thetable is Holmes, in shirt-sleeves. Occasionally heknocks off an ash onto a glass slide, studies it under amicroscope.Watson, in a dressing gown, is sitting in the chair withthe writing arm, documenting the latest Holmes adventurefor Strand Magazine. The open mail has now been affixedto the center of the wooden mantelpiece, with a dagger.Mrs. Hudson is clearing the dinner dishes from the table,and loading them onto the shelf of the dumbwaiter. Theaccumulation of smoke in the room makes her cough.                       MRS. HUDSON          How can you stand this? Why don't you          let me air the room out?                       WATSON          Please, Mrs. Hudson -- he's working on a          definitive study of tobacco ash.                       MRS. HUDSON                 (drily)          I'm sure there's a crying need for that.                                                      10.                       WATSON          In our endeavors, it is sometimes vital          to distinguish between, say, the ashes of          a Macedonian cigarette and a Jamaican          cigar. Sor far he has classified 140          different kinds of ashes.                       MRS. HUDSON          All of which will end up on my rug.She is now pulling on the rope which lowers thedumbwaiter.                       WATSON          That'll be enough, Mrs. Hudson.                       MRS. HUDSON                 (heading for door)          All right. If you gentlemen want to stay          here and suffocate...She exits, shutting the door. For a while, the two go onworking. Then Holmes rises abruptly from the chemistrytable.                         HOLMES          She's right.    I am suffocating.                       WATSON          Let me open a window.                       HOLMES          Not from lack of air -- from lack of          activity. Sitting here week after week --          blowing smoke rings -- staring through a          microscope -- there's no challenge in          that.                       WATSON          Personally, I consider it a major          contribution to scientific criminology...Holmes has opened his violin case and taken out hisfiddle.                       HOLMES          How I envy you your mind, Watson.                         WATSON          You do?                                                          11.                         HOLMES            It's placid, imperturbable, prosaic. But            my mind rebels against stagnation. It's            like a racing engine, tearing itself to            pieces because it's not connected up with            the work for which it was built.He has tucked the violin under his chin, starts toimprovise a nervous pent-up melody. There is nothingamateurish about it -- he plays quite well.Watson resumes working on his manuscript. Suddenly themusic stops. Watson looks up apprehensively. Holmes hasput down the violin, and is crossing to the sideboard.He opens Watson's medical bag, takes out a bottle ofcocaine, starts toward his bedroom. Watson pushes thewriting arm to the side, rises from his chair.                           WATSON            Holmes --Holmes   pays no   attention, continues into the bedroom.Watson   crosses   to the open door. Inside the bedroom,Holmes   has put   down the cocaine bottle on the washstand,and is   rolling   up his left sleeve.                         WATSON            Holmes, where is your self-control?                         HOLMES            Fair question.From a drawer he takes a morocco case, opens it, removesa hypodermic syringe.                         WATSON            Aren't you ashamed of yourself?                           HOLMES            Thoroughly.    But this will take care of            it.He has removed the stopper from the cocaine bottle, andinserting the hypodermic needle into it, starts to drawup the liquid.

A bus comes down the street, the open topdeck sprouting umbrellas like black mushrooms.                       WATSON'S VOICE          Naturally, I don't mean to imply that my          friend was always on cocaine -- sometimes          it was opium, sometimes it was hashish.          And once he went one of these dreadful          binges, there was no telling how long it          would last.INT. LIVING ROOM - 221B BAKER STREET - DAYRain beats on the windows.    Holmes and Watson are in themiddle of an argument.                       WATSON          The only reason you moved in with me is          to have a steady supply of stimulants.                       HOLMES          Now, now, Watson -- you mustn't          underestimate your other charms.He starts into the bedroom.                       WATSON          Holmes, I warn you. If you lock yourself          in there once more --                       HOLMES          I intend to do nothing of the sort.He takes the hypodermic out of the drawer in thewashstand, starts back into the living room with it.                       HOLMES          Not until you replace this needle.    It is          getting rather blunt.As Watson glares at him, the door opens and Mrs. Hudsoncomes bustling in. Holmes hides the hypodermic behindhis back.                       MRS. HUDSON          I made you some tea and cress sandwiches.                                                         13.She opens the door of the dumbwaiter, starts to pull itup.

And let's not          waste any time.Mrs. Hudson sighs, exits into Watson's bedroom.                       HOLMES          May I be so bold as to ask where you'er          going?                       WATSON          I don't know yet. But I intend to resume          my practice. I am, after all, a doctor.          And quite a competent one, if I say so as          shouldn't.                       HOLMES          You'll find it very dull -- snipping out          tonsils and flushing out kidneys --Watson is glancing around the room, searching forsomething.                       HOLMES          If you're looking for your medical bag,          you hid it under the Moorish table.                 (as Watson crosses to it)          Which shows a little more imagination          than last time -- when it was under your          bed.                                                        14.Watson picks up the Moorish table, disclosing the medicalbag, standing on end. He sets the bag down on thefender, opens it.                       WATSON          I will, of course, continue to pay my          half of the rent until you find someone          to share these rooms with you.                       HOLMES          Where am I going to find anyone who will          put up with my rather eccentric habits?                       WATSON                 (taking hypodermic needle out                  of bag)          Here's a fresh needle -- and here's my          farewell present to you.He takes out three bottles of narcotics, puts them on themantel.                       WATSON          If you want to destroy yourself, go right          ahead. But I won't sit by and watch you          doing it.He snaps his bag shut, carries it toward his bedroom.                       HOLMES          Watson...Watson disappears into the bedroom, slamming the door.Holmes looks after him, then looks at the bottles of dopeon the mantelpiece. He starts pacing. After a moment hestops at the chemistry table, studies the assortedglassware on the shelves above.INT. WATSON'S BEDROOM - DAYThere are two open valises on the bed. Watson is movingaround the room, collecting various odds and ends, whileMrs. Hudson packs his clothes.                       MRS. HUDSON          It's so sad. You and Mr. Holmes -- after          all these years --                 (she sobs)                                                       15.                       WATSON          Please, Mrs. Hudson -- none of that.Mrs. Hudson takes a clean handkerchief from the openvalise, blows her nose.                       MRS. HUDSON          I'll wash this and send it on to you.                       WATSON          I'll be at Brown's Hotel.                       MRS. HUDSON                 (still sniffling)          I know how it feels -- I once went          through a divorce myself.                       WATSON                 (removing diploma from wall)          Actually, I'm rather looking forward to          it. Leading a normal life again.          Regular office hours -- nine to three --          and if occasionally there's an emergency          call in the middle of the night, I know          it's going be appendicitis and not an ax          murder. Let Holmes go mucking about in          the fog and the sleet, looking for a          bloodstained collar-button out on the          moors, with some demented hound snapping          at his behind --From the living room comes the sound of a revolver shot.Mrs. Hudson screams and Watson looks off in alarm. Thenhe races out of the room, diploma in hand, followed byMrs. Hudson.INT. LIVING ROOM - DAYAs they burst into the room, they see Holmes sitting onthe stool beside the chemistry table, a revolver in hishand. He has shattered one of the narcotics bottles onthe mantelpiece, and is aiming at a second one.                       MRS. HUDSON          Mr. Holmes...Holmes fires, smashing the second bottle. As Mrs. Hudsontakes a step forward, he waves her away with the gun.                                                         16.                       HOLMES          Please, Mrs. Hudson.    You're in my line          of fire.Watson jerks Mrs.   Hudson back as Holmes lets go withanother shot. The    bullet disposes of the third bottle,splattering glass   and liquid all over the place. Holmesrises calmly from   the stool, crosses to the desk, putsthe revolver away   in a drawer.                       MRS. HUDSON                 (outraged)          How many times have I told you I will not          tolerate pistol practice on my premises?          I should have evicted you when you shot          them holes in my wall.She points up to a spot near the ceiling. Neatly tracedin bullet holes are the initials V.R., with a small crownabove them.                       HOLMES          Merely celebrating Her Majesty's Golden          Jubilee.                       MRS. HUDSON          Look at that mess you made --Watson is looking at Holmes with a little smile on hisface.                       WATSON          It's all right, Mrs. Hudson. I'll clean          it up --                 (hands her the diploma)          -- while you unpack my things.                         MRS. HUDSON          Unpack?                       HOLMES          You heard him.A bewildered Mrs. Hudson goes back into the bedroom.Watson crosses to the fireplace, picks up the whiskbroomand the coal shovel, starts cleaning up the broken glass.                       WATSON          Thank you, Holmes. I know how difficult          it must've been for you --                                                      17.                       HOLMES          Not really. It was simple choice between          a bad habit and a good companion.                       WATSON          You've made me very happy.                       HOLMES          I've often been accused of being cold and          unemotional. I admit to it. And yet, in          my cold, unemotional way, I'm very fond          of you, Watson.                       WATSON          I know that. But one likes to hear these          things occasionally.He notices the violin, which has been splattered with theliquid from the shattered bottle, picks it up.                       WATSON          Look at this. Covered with that nasty          stuff. I'd better dry it off.                        HOLMES          I'll do it.He takes the instrument, and dabbing it with ahandkerchief, carries it toward the violin case.                       WATSON          For a moment, I was worried that you were          going to let me walk out -- that you          weren't even going to try to stop me.                       HOLMES          Now, Watson -- you know there's nothing I          wouldn't do to keep you here.With a side-glance at the busy Watson, he opens theviolin case. Neatly stashed away around the edges arethe three original bottles of narcotics. The ones heshot up, of course, were substitutes from the chemistryset. He places the violin carefully among the bottles,closes the case, snaps the locks. As he moves off, weSTAY on the violin case.                                                         18.                       WATSON'S VOICE          It was not the first not the last time he          tricked me like that. Normally, I was          inclined to forgive him...

In front of him is a letter, onblue note-paper, and a pair of theatre tickets.                       WATSON'S VOICE          But on one occasion, he did something          that was so utterly unforgivable, that I          would gladly have murdered him -- had it          not been for my saintly disposition.Watson sets down his coffee cup, picks up the letter andthe tickets, rises from his chair. He starts to pace --addressing Holmes, who is off-scene.                       WATSON          Why are you being so stubborn, Holmes?          Why won't you go?

Why should someone          send up two free tickets? Anonymously,          at that.                       WATSON          Whoever sent them must be in great          distress. The note says --                                                         19.                 (reading it)          'Please! You are the only man in the          world who can help me.'                       HOLMES          I suspect it's some sort of plot.

PETROVA                 (to Holmes)          Otchen rada.She extends her hand, and Holmes takes it.                       HOLMES          Madame.He kisses her hand. Petrova appraises him from head totoe, and back again.                       PETROVA                 (to Holmes)          Vi menshe rostom chem ja ozhidala.                       HOLMES          Madame says you are shorter than she          thought.                                                       26.                       HOLMES          I didn't mean to be.                       PETROVA          No eto nie vazhno. Menia interessujut          glavnim obra som vashi mosghi.                       ROGOZHIN          Short, tall, who cares?   It is the brains          that count.                       HOLMES                 (to Rogozhin)          Thank you.                 (catching himself, to                  Petrova)          Thank you.Petrova rises, crosses to the paravent.                       PETROVA          Ja prochia vsie vashi prikliuchenia.          Zamiechatelno! Os sobenno sobaka          Baskervillei.                       ROGOZHIN          Madame is great admirer of yours. She          has read every story -- her favorite is          Big Dog from Baskerville.                       HOLMES          I'm afraid it loses something in          translation.Petrova is now behind the paravent, undressing, only herhead visible.                       PETROVA          Nikolai, pokazhite iemu skripku.Rogozhin picks up a violin case, opens it.                       ROGOZHIN          Mr. Holmes, you know about fiddles.                 (takes violin out, hands it                  to him)          What is your opinion of this?Holmes holds the violin up, peers through one of thesound holes.                                                         27.                       HOLMES                 (reading)          'Antonius Stradivarius Cremonesis, Anno          1709.' Well, the label is authentic.                 (examines violin, plucks                  strings)          Judging from the shape, the color of the          varnish, and the tone, I would say it is          a genuine Stradivarius of the best          period.                       ROGOZHIN          You like?                       HOLMES          It's magnificent.                       PETROVA                 (from behind paravent)          Skazhite jemu chto eto podarok ot menia.                       ROGOZHIN          Here -- take it. Madame says it is          yours.                       HOLMES          Mine?                       ROGOZHIN          For services you will render.                       HOLMES          My fees as a detective are not exactly          trifling -- but a Stradivarius -- you're          not serious.                        ROGOZHIN          I am not.   But Madame is.Petrova emerges from behind the paravent, in a brocadedressing gown.                       PETROVA          Nalejte vodki i obiasnite jemu v chom          dielo.She drapes herself on the chaise.                                              28.              ROGOZHINAll right.   I will pour vodka andexplain.       (starts pouring vodka; it is        pink)Mr. Holmes, what you have seen tonight islast and positively final performance ofMadame Petrova. She is retiring.             HOLMESWhat a shame.             ROGOZHINShe has been dancing since she was threeyears old. And after all, she is nowthirty-eight.             HOLMES       (gallantly)I must say she doesn't look thirty-eight.             ROGOZHINThat is because she is   forty-nine.       (he hands her a   glass of        vodka, with an   exaggerated        smile)So Madame has decided   to leave ballet andspend life bringing up   her child.             HOLMESHow admirable.             ROGOZHIN       (hands him vodka)Problem now is to find father.              HOLMESOh?   Is he missing?             ROGOZHINCorrect.             HOLMESAnd that's why you called me in?             ROGOZHINAlso correct. We must have father,because without father, how can there bechild?                                                           29.                       HOLMES          I see. The whole thing is still in the          planning stage --                       ROGOZHIN          Correct again. Madame would like child          to be brilliant and beautiful. Since she          is beautiful -- she now needs man who is          brilliant.Holmes' eyes wander slowly toward Petrova.    She raisesher glass.                         PETROVA          Za zdorovie.                       ROGOZHIN                 (raising his glass)          Za zdorovie.                         HOLMES          Za zdrovie.Petrova and Rogozhin down their vodka bottoms up.    Holmestakes one swallow, then stops.                       HOLMES          What's in it?                       ROGOZHIN          What does it taste like?                         HOLMES          Red pepper.                       ROGOZHIN          That's what's in it.While Rogozhin refills Petrova's glass and his own,Holmes takes another tentative sip.                       PETROVA                 (to Holmes)          Kogda mi smozhem dvinutsa v putj?                       HOLMES          I beg your pardon?                                             30.             ROGOZHINMadame wants to know how soon you can beready.            HOLMESReady?             ROGOZHINTo leave for Venice. All arrangementshave been made. You will spend one weekthere with Madame...             HOLMESWell, this is all very flattering. Butsurely there are other me -- better men --             ROGOZHINTo tell you truth, you were not firstchoice. We considered Russian writer,Tolstoi --             HOLMESThat's more like it.   The man's a genius.             ROGOZHINToo old... Then we considered thephilosopher, Nietzsche --             HOLMESAbsolutely first-rate mind...             ROGOZHINToo German... And we consideredTschaikowski --             HOLMESOh, you couldn't go wrong withTschaikowski --             ROGOZHINWe could -- and we did.   It wascatastrophe.            HOLMESWhy?             ROGOZHINYou don't know? Because Tschaikowski --how shall put it? Women not his glass oftea.                                            31.              HOLMESPity, that.             PETROVA       (to Rogozhin)Skazhite jemu chto je otchen dovolna etimresheniem.             ROGOZHINMadame is very happy with final choice.             HOLMESMadame mustn't be too hasty.   She mustremember I'm an Englishman.              ROGOZHINSo?             HOLMESYou know what they say about us. Ifthere's one thing more deplorable thanour cooking, it's our love-making. Weare not exactly the most romantic ofpeople --             ROGOZHINPerfect. We don't want sentimentalidiots -- falling in love, committingsuicide. One week in Venice -- she goesback to St. Petersburg with baby -- yougo back to London with fiddle.             HOLMESAn equitable arrangement.       (puts down violin)About my medical history -- when youasked me -- I neglected to mention asmall detail. There is hemophilia in myfamily. We're all bleeders.             ROGOZHIN       (to Petrova)On govorit, chto v jevo semie stradajutghemofilijei.             PETROVAPust nie bezpokoitsa.    Ja ostrighu sebenoghti.                                                       32.                       ROGOZHIN          Madame says not to worry.    She will not          scratch you.                       HOLMES          That's reassuring to know.    But --                       PETROVA                 (to Rogozhin)          Pochemu on kolebletsa? On nie nahodit          menia dostatochno privlekatelnoi?                       ROGOZHIN          Madame says you talk too much.    You find          her attractive or no?Before Holmes can answer, the door opens and Watsonsticks his head in. He is flushed and slightlyinebriated, and there is a flower tucked behind his ear.From off comes the SOUND of wild balalaika music.                       WATSON          Excuse me.                 (to Rogozhin)          What does prokanzik mean?                       ROGOZHIN          It means 'You little devil.'                        WATSON          It does?   I am? Thank you.He hurries off, shutting the door.                       ROGOZHIN                 (to Holmes)          I repeat question. You find Madame          attractive or no?Holmes is still looking at the door where Watson exited,an idea forming in his mind.                       HOLMES                 (turning to Rogozhin)          Oh, I find her most attractive -- for a          woman, that is.                       ROGOZHIN          Then no problem.                                                33.             HOLMESMaybe a slight one.       You see, I am not afree man.              ROGOZHINNot free?   You are a bachelor.             HOLMESA bachelor -- living with anotherbachelor -- for the last five years.Five very happy years.             ROGOZHINWhat is it you are trying to tell me?             HOLMESI hoped I could avoid the subject. Butsome of us -- through a cruel caprice ofMother Nature --             ROGOZHINGet to point.             HOLMESThe point is that Tschaikowski is not anisolated case.             ROGOZHINYou mean, you and Dr. Watson -- ?       (Holmes nods)He is your glass of tea?             HOLMESIf you want to be picturesque about it.             PETROVA       (slightly agitated)Chto on govorit? Pri chom tutChaikovsky?               ROGOZHINOn pederast.             PETROVA       (on her feet now; flaring)Jescho odin? Eto stanovitsa odnoobrasno!Kakoi vi idiot!                                                          34.                          HOLMES                   (picking up his silk hat and                    cane)            Believe me, Madame, the loss is all mine.            But I would prefer to disappoint you know            than disappoint you in a gondola in            Venice.He takes her limp hand, kisses it.   Then he crosses tothe door.                         HOLMES                   (imitating Rogozhin's accent)            It would have been catastrophe.He exits.   Rogozhin starts to pour himself another glassof vodka.   Petrova slaps the glass out of his hand.                         PETROVA                   (screaming)            Potchemu vi nie vijasnili eto eto ranshe,            prezhde chem posoritj menia!STAGEThe party has built into a real wingding by now. It'swild -- drinking, laughing, singing. Everybody is turnedon -- especially Watson. He is dancing with a dozen ofthe ballerinas to madly accelerating balalaika music.Flower behind ear, hair mussed, tie undone, short ofbreath -- he is in paradise.Holmes makes his way through the revelers, approachesWatson.                         HOLMES            Watson!                   (Watson pays no attention)            Watson, are you coming?                         WATSON                   (without missing a step)            What is it, old boy?                         HOLMES            We're going home.                                                       35.                       WATSON          Home? Not a chance. Not the slightest --          not the remotest chance. Toodle-ooo.He waves goodbye, and goes on swirling dizzily with thegirls. Holmes puts on his silk hat and leaves.A shaken Rogozhin comes up to the buffet, pours himself astiff drink of vodka. As he drinks his eyes follow thedancing Watson balefully.Watson spins off several of the girls, grabs anothergroup. His ex-partners wind up close to Rogozhin. Hewhispers something to them. Their eyes widen, and theystare at Watson with disbelief. Watson again switchespartners, and the first girls now whisper intensely tothose who just left the floor. The same reaction.Watson, oblivious to all this, is whirling around withanother set of girls.By now some of the girls who are in on the secret arewhispering to the male dancers in tights. Their reactionis slightly different. They are seeing Watson in a newlight. And before Watson knows what's happening, he hasbeen abandoned by all the girls, and is joined first byone pair then another pair of male dancers, till he isdancing only with gay guys in tights. It gradually dawnson Watson that there is something wrong with this stateof affairs. After some difficulty, he breaks away fromthem.                         WATSON          Hold on!    Just a moment!Spotting Rogozhin, he crosses to him.   The girls shrinkaway at his approach.                       WATSON                 (bewildered)          What's going on? What happened to the          girls?                        ROGOZHIN          Why?   Do you not prefer it this way?                        WATSON          What way?                                                         36.                       ROGOZHIN          You don't have to pretend. Mr. Holmes          told us everything -- about you and him --                       WATSON          About me and him?                       ROGOZHIN          Come now, no need to be bashful. We are          not bourgeois. Maybe with doctors and          detectives is unusual -- but in ballet,          is very usual.                       WATSON          What is?                       ROGOZHIN          Caprice of Mother Nature. Look at Pavel          and Mischa and Boris and Dmitri --Watson looks around at the boys in tights, who arestanding in a half-circle, grinning at him insolently.It is beginning to dawn on him. He pales.                       ROGOZHIN          -- And Ilya and Sergei --                 (breaks off, rocks his hand                  back and forth)          Sergei -- half and half.He pours himself another vodka. Watson grabs the glassaway from him, downs it with a gulp.                                               DISSOLVE TO:INT. LIVING ROOM - 221B BAKER STREET - NIGHTIn contrast to the frenetic ambiance of the back-stageparty, the room seems doubly placid. Holmes, his dinnercoat replaced by a smoking jacket, is sitting in the wingchair, having a quiet pipe after the evening's peculiaradventure. Only the desk lamp is lit. From the street,there is the sound of hurried, angry footstepsapproaching the house. Holmes turns his head languidly --he knows who is coming.                                                         37.EXT. BAKER STREET - NIGHTAn enraged Watson, cane and opera glasses in hand, andthe flower still behind his ear, is jogging down thecenter of the deserted street.INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHTHolmes rises casually, twists the wing chair so that itsback is to the door, crosses to the lamp on the desk,turns the wick down. From off comes the sound ofWatson's key rattling in the front door lock.STAIRCASE - 221B BAKER STREET - NIGHTThe front door opens and Watson storms into thevestibule.                       WATSON          Holmes!He races up the stairs and across the landing, flingsopen the door of the flat.                       WATSON          Holmes!INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHTWatson, grim and breathless, stands in the open doorway.Over the back of the wing chair, he sees smoke curling upfrom Holmes' pipe.                       WATSON          There you are, you wretch! You rotter!          You blackguard! Of all the vile,          unspeakable fabrications. What do you          have to say for yourself?No answer from Holmes. We now see -- but Watson does not-- that the chair is occupied by a section of Holmes'smoking machine, with the pipe attached.                       WATSON          Don't just sit there -- speak up, man!                                                       38.Still no answer -- just a little pipe smoke drifting upfrom the wing chair. Incensed, Watson raises the operaglasses, tosses them toward the chair. There is a loudthud, the pipe falls to the floor, then there is silence.Watson suddenly becomes concerned.                        WATSON          Holmes...?   Are you all right, Holmes?He approaches the chair apprehensively, shoves  it aside --and there on the floor is the smoking machine,  stillwheezing slightly. Watson picks it up, and his   eyestravel to Holmes, standing in a shadowy corner,  workingthe bellows with his foot.                       HOLMES          From the sound of your footsteps, I          gathered that you were not in a          particularly amiable mood.                       WATSON                 (with renewed fury)          How could you do a dastardly thing like          that to me? What the deuce were you          thinking of?He dashes the smoking machine to the floor.                        HOLMES          Watson, you  have my most abject          apologies.   But have you ever been          cornered by  a madwoman?  It seemed like          the only way  to get out of it without          hurting her  feelings.                       WATSON          What about my feelings? And my          reputation? Do you realize the gravity          of what you have done? The possible          repercussions?                       HOLMES          So there'll be a little gossip about you          in St. Petersburg...                       WATSON          These things spread like wildfire. I can          just hear those malicious whispers behind          my back. I'll never be able to show my          face in polite society...                                                      39.          And if it ever got back to my old          regiment -- you don't know the Fifth          Northumberland Fusiliers -- they'll          strike me off the rolls -- they'll cut          off my pension...                       HOLMES          Watson, you're running amok.                       WATSON          Dishonored, disgraced, ostracized.   What          am I to do?                       HOLMES          Well, for one thing, I'd get rid of that          flower.He points to the flower behind Watson's ear. Watsongrabs the flower, hurls it into the fireplace.                       WATSON          You may think this is funny, but we're          both in the same boat. We must take          desperate measures. We must stop this          talk...                 (a beat, then an idea)          Maybe if we got married...                       HOLMES          Then they'd really talk...                       WATSON                 (starts pacing)          Obviously, we cannot continue to live          under the same roof. We must move apart.                       HOLMES          Of course, we can still see each other          clandestinely -- on remote benches in          Hyde Park, and in the waiting rooms of          suburban railway stations --                       WATSON                 (a change in attitude;                  defiant)          The whole thing is ridiculous.   We have          nothing to hide.                       HOLMES          That's what I've been trying to tell you.                                                          40.                       WATSON          Let somebody start a rumor -- just one          ugly word -- and we'll sue them for          slander.                       HOLMES          Nobody would dare. After all, you have          an enviable record with the fair sex.                       WATSON          Damn right. I can get women from three          continents to testify for me. And you          can get women to vouch for you, too --          can't you, Holmes?No answer from Holmes.   Watson is becoming a littleconcerned.                       WATSON          Can you, Holmes?                       HOLMES          Good night, Watson.He starts toward his bedroom.                       WATSON          Holmes, let me ask you a question --                 (Holmes stops)          I hope I'm not being presumptuous -- but          there have been women in your life?                       HOLMES          The answer is yes.                 (a relieved sigh from Watson)          You're being presumptuous.                 (Watson's face falls)          Good night.He walks into his bedroom, shutting the door.    Watsontakes a tentative step after him.                         WATSON          Holmes...                                                DISSOLVE TO:                                                      41.INT. LIVING ROOM - 221B BAKER STREET - NIGHTThere is a cheery fire burning in the grate. Holmes isstretched out full-length on the couch, playing a set ofCorelli variations on his violin. Watson is in his usualchair, reading the Evening Standard.                       WATSON'S VOICE          What, indeed, was his attitude toward          women? Was there some secret he was          holding back -- or was he just a thinking          machine, incapable of any emotion?EXT. BAKER STREET - NIGHTWisps of fog swirl along the street, making yellow haloesaround street lamps.                       WATSON'S VOICE          I was not to get the answer until we          became involved in what I consider to be          the most outrageous case in all our years          together.Out of the mist comes a hansom cab, with the dim figureof a woman visible in the passenger seat. The cab stopsin front of 221B, and the driver starts to get down.From upstairs comes the faint sound of violin music.INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHTWatson steps up to the window, pulls the curtain aside,looks down toward the street.EXT. 221B BAKER STREET - NIGHTThe cabbie crosses the pavement, consults an address inhis hand, glances up at the number of the house, thenrings the bell.INT. LIVING ROOM - 221B BAKER STREET - NIGHTWatson turns away from the window, as the BELL downstairsrings again. Holmes stops playing.                                                       42.                       WATSON          Were you expecting someone?                       HOLMES          Not at this hour.                       WATSON          Maybe Mrs. Hudson is entertaining.                       HOLMES          I never found her so.Watson crosses to the door, opens it, steps out.   Holmesresumes playing Corelli.VESTIBULE AND STAIRCASE - 221B BAKER STREET - NIGHTMrs. Hudson, in a robe and night-cap, is talking to thecabbie in the open street door when Watson appears on thelanding above.                       WATSON          What is it, Mrs. Hudson?                       MRS. HUDSON                 (looking up)          There's a cabbie here -- he says you owe          him two-and-six.                       WATSON          For what?                       CABBIE                 (to Watson)          For the fare, guv'nor. The young lady          doesn't have any money.                       WATSON          What young lady?                       CABBIE          This one.He reaches out the door, pulls in the young lady inquestion. She is in her early thirties, with strikinglyhandsome features, but at the moment she is somewhatworse for wear. She is wrapped in a blanket, her hair iswet, and there is a bruise on her temple.                                                         43.She is wearing and wedding ring and her name, we willsubsequently learn, is GABRIELLE.                       WATSON          Well.  What have we here?                 (he starts down the stairs)          Who are you, miss? What happened to you?                       GABRIELLE                 (slight accent)          I don't know.                       CABBIE          That's all she keeps saying -- I don't          know, I don't know.The violin music stops o.s.   Watson has now reached thefoot of the stairs.                       WATSON          Where did she come from?                       CABBIE          From the river. I was driving down the          Embankment, just below Westminster          Bridge, and there she was in the water --          drowning.Holmes appears on the landing above, violin and bow inhis hand.                       CABBIE          It wasn't easy, guv'nor -- what with the          cold water -- and her fighting me --                       HOLMES                 (from the upper landing)          Why did you bring her here?                       CABBIE          Because I found this in her hand --                 (gives a square of soggy                  cardboard to Watson)          -- 221B Baker Street -- that's right,          isn't it?Watson examines the cardboard, nods.                                                        44.                       HOLMES                 (to Gabrielle)          Young lady -- what did you want at this          address?                       GABRIELLE                 (looking up, trying to focus)          I do not remember.                       WATSON                 (to Holmes)          Rather perplexing, wouldn't you say?                        HOLMES          Rather.                       CABBIE          Well, gentlemen, you want her? -- it's          two-and-six -- or shall I throw her back          in the river?                        MRS. HUDSON          Mr. Holmes.   You can't let him --                       HOLMES          Watson, you'd better accept delivery.Watson fishes some coins out of his pocket, hands them tothe cabbie.                       WATSON          Keep the change.                       CABBIE          Thank you, guv'nor.He snatches the blanket off Gabrielle, revealing that herdress is clinging to her damply.                       CABBIE          No extra charge for the use of the horse-          blanket.He exits into the street, shutting the door.    Gabriellehugs herself for warmth.                       WATSON          You're shivering, my dear.                 (he puts his arm around her)                                                      45.          Come along. Let me get you out of those          wet clothes.He starts to lead her up the stairs.EXT. BAKER STREET - NIGHTThe cabbie has tossed the blanket into the hansom, and ismounting the driver's seat. Across the street, a mansteps out of the fog into a pool of light cast by one ofthe street lamps. He is a craggy-faced Prussian of aboutfifty, and his name is VON TIRPITZ. He looks up towardthe Holmes flat. As the hansom makes a U-turn and comesabreast of him, he hops into the cab. The hansomdisappears into the fog.INT. LIVING ROOM - 221B BAKER STREET - NIGHTWatson is leading Gabrielle to a chair by the fireplace.Holmes is putting his violin down on the table.                       WATSON          Sit here, my dear.He settles her in the chair. Holmes comes over, plucksthe square of cardboard from Watson's hand.                       WATSON          She's suffering from shock and exposure.He starts to massage her wrists to restore hercirculation.Holmes is examining the soggy cardboard. On one side istheir address, written in pencil. He turns it over,disclosing some smudges of green ink on the other side.                       HOLMES          There was some printing on the back of          this -- but it seems to have come off in          the water.Watson is now studying the bruise on Gabrielle's temple.                       WATSON          Look at this -- she's had a nasty blow on          the head.                       HOLMES                                                      46.          Could she have hit her head when she fell          or jumped into the river?                       WATSON          No. The blood has already coagulated.          So it would appear that she was the          victim of a deliberate attack... Get my          bag, will you?As Holmes fetches the medical bag, Gabrielle looks fromone to the other.                         GABRIELLE          Who are you?                       WATSON          I'm Dr. Watson -- and this is Mr.          Sherlock Holmes. Do the names mean          anything to you?                         GABRIELLE          No.                         WATSON          Think.                         GABRIELLE          I'm trying.                       HOLMES          Can you think of your own name?                          GABRIELLE                   (a beat, then shakes her                    head)          No.                       WATSON          She's obviously had a concussion -- which          often leads to temporary amnesia.He has now taken some cotton and a bottle of antisepticout of the medical bag, and is swabbing her wound.                       HOLMES          So all we know is that she was coshed on          the head, dumped into the Thames, and          subsequently dumped into our laps.                                                      47.                       WATSON          We know a lot more than that. From her          accent, we know she is foreign -- from          her ring, we know she is married -- and          there is one other clue we have...          Something I deduced while I was helping          her up the stairs. No corset.                       HOLMES          Good work.He glances down at Gabrielle's shoe, which has slippedoff her foot. Inside, slightly worn away, are the words:LA FEMME ELEGANTE.                       HOLMES                 (to Gabrielle)          Are you French?                 (in Berlitz French)          Vous etes Francaise?                       GABRIELLE                 (concentrating -- then)          Non, je ne suis pas Francaise.                       WATSON          How can she say she's not French, in          French?                       HOLMES          Vous etes Suisse?                       GABRIELLE          Non.                       HOLMES          Alors, vous etes Belge.                       GABRIELLE                 (haltingly)          Je suis pas sure.Holmes reaches behind her, turns back the collar of herdress. Sewn inside is a label reading: BAZAAR MODERN,Bruxelles.                       HOLMES          Vous etes Belge -- de Bruxelles!                                                      48.                         GABRIELLE          Bruxelles?    Oui... Je pense que oui.Mrs. Hudson has come in with a loaded tea-tray, starts toput it down on the table.                       MRS. HUDSON          Oh, dash. Will someone remove the          violin, please?Watson takes the violin off the table, and she sets downthe tray.                       WATSON          We just found out that she's Belgian.                        MRS. HUDSON          Poor thing.                       WATSON          From Brussels.                       HOLMES                 (taking Gabrielle's hand)          If you don't mind.He slips the wedding ring off her finger, picks up amagnifying glass, examines it. It is made of copper, andengraved on the inside is the inscription: Gabrielle -Emile.                       HOLMES          Your name is Gabrielle, is that right?          Gabrielle?                       GABRIELLE          I don't know.                       HOLMES          And your husband's name is Emile?                       GABRIELLE                 (vaguely)          Emile...                      HOLMES          Where is he? What are you doing in          London?                                                         49.                       GABRIELLE          I don't know.                       HOLMES          When did you arrive from Brussels?     Where          are you staying?                       GABRIELLE          I don't know.                       HOLMES          What happened at the river?   Think!          Pensez! Concentrez vous!Gabrielle bursts into sobs.                        WATSON                 (stepping forward)          That's enough, Holmes. I will not permit          you to question her in this condition.                 (helps the sobbing Gabrielle                  out of the chair)          Mrs. Hudson, put her to bed. My bed.                 (Mrs. Hudson gives him a                  look)          I'll sleep on the couch.                       MRS. HUDSON          Come, my dear.She puts her arm around Gabrielle, who is still crying,leads her into Watson's bedroom.                       WATSON          I'd better mix her a sleeping potion.He gets a packet of white powder out of his medical bag,and during the following, stirs a spoonful into her tea-cup.                       HOLMES          Watson, I think we should arrange to have          her removed to a hospital.                       WATSON          Under no circumstances.                       HOLMES          She should have medical attention.                                                        50.                       WATSON          She can get that from me. But more          importantly, she must be protected --          there has already been one attempt on her          life.                       HOLMES          This temporary amnesia -- how temporary          is it?                       WATSON          It depends on the extent of the injury.          It's like veils shrouding her memory. It          could clear up in a few days -- or a few          weeks.                       HOLMES          Watson, this is a very small flat -- we          don't want to clutter it up with women...                       WATSON          Holmes, we've never had a case like this.          A woman comes to us with a problem -- we          don't know who the woman is -- and we          don't know what the problem is. Don't          you find that challenging?                       HOLMES          Quite. But we can't afford to wait for          those veils to lift -- we must break          through them as quickly as possible.                        WATSON          You   really feel it's that urgent?                       HOLMES          I do. The sooner we solve the case, the          sooner we can get rid of her.                       WATSON          Oh.He picks up the cup of tea with the sedative in it,carries it toward the door of his bedroom.

A policeman, on patrolduty, is strolling along the sidewalk, swinging histruncheon. Suddenly he sees something up ahead.Alarmed, he ducks into the doorway of a building,flattens himself against the door.From the opposite direction comes a horse-drawn water-sprinkling wagon. The spray covers the sidewalks as wellas the street.The policeman waits till the wagon is past, then stepsout of the doorway relieved, resumes his patrol.INT.

HOLMES' BEDROOM - DAWNHolmes, in a dressing gown, is standing by the window,studying the square of cardboard with the green smudgeson it. His bed has not been slept in.INT. WATSON'S BEDROOM - DAWNGabrielle is asleep in Watson's bed. The door opensslowly, and Holmes looks in. He studies the sleepingGabrielle for a moment, then quietly pulls the door shut.As the latch clicks into place, Gabrielle awakes and sitsup in bed, her back to CAMERA. She is nude.                       GABRIELLE          Emile?She starts to get out of bed.INT. HOLMES' BEDROOM - DAWNHolmes is back in his room, once more examining thecardboard by the light of the window. The door ofWatson's bedroom opens, and Gabrielle comes out.                                                      52.                       GABRIELLE          Emile?Holmes looks up as Gabrielle appears in the open doorway.                        GABRIELLE          Emile?   Is that you, Emile?                       HOLMES                 (stepping into shadow)          Yes, Gabrielle.                       GABRIELLE                 (hurrying toward him)          Ah, Emile. I thought I'd never find you.                 (embracing him)          Hold me. Hold me tight.                 (Holmes puts his arms around                  her)          It's been such a long time. So many          nights. You know what I did before I          left Brussels?                       HOLMES          What?                       GABRIELLE          I hope you won't be angry with me. I          bought myself an expensive negligee.                       HOLMES          Did you?                       GABRIELLE                 (moving toward bed)          A pink negligee with maribou feathers.          Don't you think that's a foolish thing          for a married woman?                 (she gets into bed, beckons                  to him)          Come.                       HOLMES          Where is the negligee?                       GABRIELLE          In my luggage... Come here.                                                         53.                       HOLMES                 (moving toward her)          And where is your luggage?                       GABRIELLE                 (impatiently)          I don't know. Come, my love.   Come.          Please.As she extends her right hand to him, in a beckoninggesture, Holmes notices something on the palm. He takesher hand in his. There, in the same green ink as thesmudges on the cardboard, are what appear the be theletters "I", "O", and Greek "E". Crossing to the wash-stand, he picks up his magnifying shaving mirror, returnsto the bed, holds it up against the palm of Gabrielle'shand.                       GABRIELLE          What is it, Emile? What are you doing?Clearly reflected in the mirror is the reverse image ofthe lettering on Gabrielle's palm -- the number "301".                                                DISSOLVE TO:INT. LIVING ROOM - 221B BAKER STREET - DAYThe table is set for breakfast, and Mrs. Hudson isopening the curtains, flooding the room with sunlight.Then she moves over to the couch, where Watson issleeping in an awkward position.                       MRS. HUDSON          Dr. Watson!                 (she claps her hands and he                  wakes up)          Your porridge is getting lumpy. Hadn't          you better get up?Watson tries to rise, falls back with a moan.                       WATSON          I would like to very much. But --                 (he turns over on his                  stomach)          Mrs. Hudson, would you mind planting your          knee in the small of my back?                                                         54.                       MRS. HUDSON          Yes, I would.                        WATSON          Please!   I'm in excruciating pain.Mrs. Hudson tentatively rests her knee on Watson's back.                       WATSON          A bit higher -- just below my seventh          vertebra --                 (Mrs. Hudson follows                  instructions)          That's good. Put your arms under mine --          fold them behind my neck --Mrs. Hudson presses down harder, and there is a distinctsnap.                       WATSON          Bless you.                 (he rises, rubbing his neck)          That damn couch.                 (crossing to table)          You'd better see if our patient is awake.He seats himself at the table. Mrs. Hudson crosses tothe door of Watson's bedroom, opens it, starts inside,then stops.                        MRS. HUDSON          Dr. Watson.   She's gone.                        WATSON          Gone?He jumps up from the table, joins Mrs. Hudson, looks pasther. The bed is empty. Gabrielle's clothes are inevidence, but there is no sign of her.Watson strides towards Holmes' bedroom.                        WATSON          Holmes!   Holmes! She's gone!He throws the door open, is about to step inside when hesees something that makes him freeze.                                                        55.INT. HOLMES' BEDROOM - DAYGabrielle is asleep in Holmes' bed, covered by just asheet, and obviously naked underneath. Holmes is not inthe room.Mrs. Hudson comes up behind Watson, in the open doorway,peers over his shoulder.                       MRS. HUDSON                 (scandalized)          Well, I never!There is the sound of the hall door opening, and theyboth turn.INT. LIVING ROOM - DAYHolmes breezes in, carrying a large suitcase, withleather straps around it. Tucked under the straps is awhite parasol. And attached to the handle of thesuitcase is a cardboard tag with the number 301 on it, ingreen.                       HOLMES                 (inhaling deeply)          Mmmmm. I smell porridge.   Lumpy as          usual, I suppose.He sets the suitcase down on the couch, as Watson andMrs. Hudson approach.                       WATSON          Oh, there you are, Holmes. We were just          wondering -- how --                 (points from his bedroom to                  Holmes')                       MRS. HUDSON                 (sternly)          We certainly were.                       HOLMES          Mrs. Hudson, why don't you go down to the          kitchen -- get a towel -- and wipe that          look of disapproval off your face.                                                        56.                       MRS. HUDSON          Liberties -- in my house!She exits huffily.                       WATSON          You can't really blame her -- I mean, the          way it looks -- if I didn't know you          better, I might suspect you'd taken          advantage of the young lady.                       HOLMES          As a matter of fact, I did take advantage          of her... Would you hand me the butter-          knife, please?                       WATSON          Of course.He picks up the butter-knife from the table, suddenlyturns back with a delayed reaction.                       WATSON          You did what?                       HOLMES                 (taking butter-knife from                  him)          Thank you.He starts to pry open the locks of the suitcase with thebutter-knife.                       WATSON                 (spluttering)          Holmes, this is reprehensible! Where are          your professional ethics? Have you no          sense of decency, no shame --                       HOLMES          None whatsoever. If you must know, I          found her body quite rewarding.                       WATSON          You cad!                       HOLMES          Especially the palm of her right hand.                                                         57.                       WATSON          I'd rather not hear about it!                       HOLMES          Very well. Then I won't bother to tell          you how I traced her suitcase.                       WATSON          That's her suitcase?                       HOLMES          Remember that piece of soggy cardboard          with our address on it? It was a luggage          ticket -- the number rubbed off on her          hand. And since she must have arrived          from Brussels by the boat train, I          concluded that she had checked her          belongings at Victoria Station.                       WATSON          By Jove! If you're right, we should find          a clue to her identity.Holmes has now forced open the locks.                       HOLMES          Or at least a pink negligee with maribou          feathers.He opens the suitcase, lifts out the top piece ofclothing, holds it up -- a pink negligee with mariboufeathers.                       HOLMES          Voila!                       WATSON          Let's see - what else is in here?They start sorting through the clothes in the suitcase.Holmes removes a tied bundle of letters.                       HOLMES          Now we're getting somewhere.As he examines the envelope, Watson takes out a framedphoto of a rather attractive man of fifty.                       WATSON          Who do you suppose this is?                                                         58.Gabrielle appears from Holmes' bedroom wearing Holmes'dressing gown. She is unsteady on her feet and somewhatdazed. Holmes looks up.                       HOLMES          Come in, Madame Valladon.                 (Gabrielle stops)          You are Gabrielle Valladon.                        GABRIELLE          Yes.                       HOLMES                 (holding up photo)          And this is your husband, Emile Valladon?                        GABRIELLE          Yes.Her eyes fall on the open suitcase.                       HOLMES          Sorry to have ransacked your valise.     But          since you came to us for help --                        GABRIELLE          Where am I?                       WATSON          221B Baker Street.                       GABRIELLE          Oh, yes...                 (a beat, as she orients                  herself)          Which of you is Mr. Holmes and which is          Dr. Watson?                       HOLMES          Dr. Watson is the handsome one.Watson, pleased, twirls the end of his mustache.Gabrielle sways slightly.                       HOLMES          That's the way he affects most women.He helps her into a chair.                                                      59.                       WATSON                 (to Gabrielle)          Coffee. You want strong coffee.He hurries over to the breakfast table.                       GABRIELLE          It's all so confusing.                       HOLMES          Let's try to sort it out. You came to          London looking for your husband...                       GABRIELLE          Yes. He's a mining engineer. We were          married five years ago, in the Congo.                       HOLMES          Where your husband was working in a          copper mine.                       GABRIELLE          How did you know?                       HOLMES          Your wedding ring -- it's made of copper.He picks it up from the chemistry table, hands it to her.Gabrielle starts to put it on.                       GABRIELLE          Last year he invented a new kind of air          pump, and was hired by an English          company, Jonah Limited.                       WATSON                 (handing her cup of of                  coffee)          Here you are.                       HOLMES          Jonah Limited. Go on.                       GABRIELLE          We've been writing to each other          regularly. Then suddenly,  three weeks          ago, his letters stopped.  I kept writing          ... but no answer. Finally  I decided to          go to that address --                                                       60.She indicates the bundle of letters. Holmes glances atthe return address on the back of the envelope.                       HOLMES          32 Ashdown Street.                      GABRIELLE          Yes. It's just an empty store -- nobody          there. Then I tried to find Jonah          Limited. No such company exists.                       WATSON          How decidedly odd.                       HOLMES          Madame Valladon, can you think of any          reason why your husband should have lied          to you about theses things?                        GABRIELLE          Emile?   Never. He loves me -- and I love          him.                       HOLMES          So I gathered.                       GABRIELLE          I went to the police -- they said they          would send out a missing persons report --          but they didn't sound too encouraging.          Then I went to the Belgian embassy and          explained the situation to them -- and          they suggested that I consult you...                       WATSON          You could have done worse.                       GABRIELLE          I was on my way here -- and suddenly          there were footsteps behind me -- and a          hand over my mouth -- and the smell of          choloroform -- and the next thing I knew          I was in the water -- and then a man was          wrapping me in a blanket --                       HOLMES          Madame Valladon, somebody tried to kill          you last night. Do you have any idea who          could have done it?                                                        61.                       GABRIELLE          I don't understand any of it.                 (rises, goes to Holmes)          What does it all mean, Mr. Holmes? Where          is my husband? You must help me find          him.                       WATSON          We'll do our best, I assure you.                       HOLMES          Madame Valladon, I want you to send one          more letter to your husband.He crosses to the desk, picks up a sheet of paper and anenvelope, then leads Gabrielle over to the chair with thewriting arm, seats her in it.                       HOLMES          To Emile Valladon -- Ashdown Street --          what was that number?                       GABRIELLE                 (addressing envelope)          32. What do you want me to say in the          letter?                       HOLMES          Nothing.He folds the blank sheet of paper, and as Gabriellefinishes addressing the envelope, he inserts the paper init, starts to seal it.                       WATSON          You're sending an empty sheet of paper to          an empty shop?                       HOLMES          That empty shop is obviously    being used          as an accomodation address,    or letter-          drop. But what gets dropped     must be          picked up. The question is     how? -- and          by whom? -- and why?                                                DISSOLVE TO:                                                         62.EXT. ASHDOWN STREET - DAYThis is a run-down district in the northwestern part ofLondon. On the corner is No. 32 -- a dilapidatedabandoned shop, with windows painted halfway up.As CAMERA APPROACHES the building, we hear sawing frominside.INT. EMPTY SHOP - DAYIt is dusty, cobwebby, quite forbidding. In the rearwall is a closed sliding door, indented about a foot intothe shop. Nearby stands a large, square object, coveredwith a tarpaulin.High up in the rear wall is a slanted skylight, fittedwith an iron grill. From outside, Holmes, in deerstalkerand Inverness, can be seen sawing through the iron bars.Watson and Gabrielle are beside him.                       HOLMES          Hammer... Chisel.Watson hands him the indicated tools. Holmes chips awaythe cement from the top and bottom of the last bar, thenusing it as a hinge, swings the grill open. He letshimself through the skylight, drops to the floor. Watsonnow helps Gabrielle through the skylight, lowers hertoward Holmes, who puts his arms around her waist, easesher to the floor. For a brief moment he keeps his armsaround her. Watson has now squeezed through theskylight.                        WATSON          Here!He hands the tools to Holmes, jumps to the floor.Gabrielle is looking around the shop.                       GABRIELLE          It's so strange to think I've been          writing to a place like this all these          months.Watson crosses to the square tarpaulin-covered object.He lifts up one corner of the tarp -- and is greeted by aloud twittering of birds.                                                      63.What he has uncovered is a large cage -- and about ahundred canaries, suddenly disturbed, are flapping aroundunside.                       WATSON          Look at all these canaries. Do you          suppose this could have been a pet shop?                       HOLMES          Maybe.                 (pointing off)          Here comes our letter.Through the front window, the silhouette of a postman canbe seen approaching. He drops a letter through the slotin the front door, moves on. The letter lands on asection of floor which is solidly covered with dust --except for a series of double tracks, running to the doorand curving back.                       HOLMES          Now we are faced with the most nerve-          wracking part of the detective's job --          doing nothing.He reassembles the three tools, fitting each section intoanother, to form a cane.                       GABRIELLE          Mr. Holmes --                       HOLMES          Yes?                       GABRIELLE          I don't know how I'm going to pay you for          all this. The purse with my money is          somewhere at the bottom of the Thames.                       HOLMES          It could be worse. You could be at the          bottom of the Thames -- much to your          discomfort -- and much to my chagrin.                       WATSON          I don't understand how anybody picks up          letters here.                 (pointing)          No footprints -- just tracks. What does          it mean?                                                         64.                       HOLMES          I would surmise somebody is using ice-          skates -- if it weren't for a conspicuous          absence of ice.They become aware of a squeaking noise outside the rearof the shop, growing louder as it gets nearer. The noisestops, there is the sound of a lock turning, then therattle of a chain.                       WATSON                 (in a frantic whisper)          What do we do now?                       HOLMES                 (unfazed)          This way.He leads Gabrielle and Watson toward the rear wall, rightnext to the door. They flatten themselves with theirbacks to the wall, just as the door slides open --concealing them from view.Revealed is the mews behind the shop. In the door is anold BIDDY with straggly hair, sitting in a wheelchair.In her lap are a bulky paper bag and a tin pitcher filledwith water. As she wheels herself inside, the unoiledwheelchair squeaks loudly. She stops in front of thecage, pulls on a rope which runs through a pulley in theceiling -- and the tarpaulin rises into the air, exposingthe canaries.                       WOMAN IN WHEELCHAIR                 (addressing birds)          Good morning, my pretties. Here's Mum          with your breakfast. Did you think I'd          forgotten you?She pours grain from the paper bag into a feeder hanginginside the cage, pours water from the pitcher into atrough.                        WOMAN IN WHEELCHAIR          Some  of you will be going on a little          trip  soon -- I hate to lose you -- but          even  an old woman has to live. Although          you  might well ask, why?She cackles to herself, glances toward the front door.                                                         65.                        WOMAN IN WHEELCHAIR          Oh.   You never told me we had a letter.She starts to wheel herself toward the front of the shop.Through a crack in the door behind which our three arehiding, we see Holmes' eye watching her.The old woman reaches the letter, picks it up, studiesthe address. Then she hears something, glances towardthe open rear door.A horse-drawn wagon with a canvas top is just pullinginto the mews. Two CARTERS jump down from the driver'sseat, and one of them takes a small bird-cage from theback of the wagon. As they start in through the door,the old woman drops the letter into her lap, wheelsherself toward them.                       FIRST CARTER          Morning, Duchess.                       WOMAN IN WHEELCHAIR          Morning.                       SECOND CARTER          What have you been doing with yourself?                        WOMAN IN WHEELCHAIR          What do you think? Taking dancing          lessons.                 (she stops in front of the                  cage)          How many do you want this time?                       FIRST CARTER          Two dozen.He opens the door of the small cage, the bottom of whichis covered with newspaper, starts transferring canariesinto it from the large cage.                       WOMAN IN WHEELCHAIR          What are they doing with all those          canaries? What's going on up there?                       SECOND CARTER          Look, Duchess, we don't know -- and we          don't want to know.                                                         66.                       FIRST CARTER          When you work for Jonah, it's better not          to ask questions.Through the crack in the door behind which he is hidden,we see Holmes' eye studying the small bird cage, as thecanaries are being transferred into it.We MOVE IN CLOSE on the small cage, and see the soilednewspaper spread on the bottom. The masthead reads:INVERNESS COURIER.                       FIRST CARTER                 (counting as he transfers                  canaries)          ... twenty-two, twenty-three, twenty-          four.He closes the doors of the cages, picks up the smallcage. His companion indicates the letter in the woman'slap.                       SECOND CARTER          How about that letter? Does that go,          too?                      WOMAN IN WHEELCHAIR          No. That's going to be picked up in          person.She chuckles. The carriers exit into the mews, stash thecage in the back of the wagon, mount the driver's seat.                       WOMAN IN WHEELCHAIR                 (to birds)          All right, my pretties. Back to sleep          you go. See you tomorrow.She pulls the rope and the tarpaulin drops back over thecage. Then she deposits the letter on top of the coveredcage, wheels herself out the rear door. As she slides itshut from outside, our trio is revealed in their hidingplaces behind the door. There is the sound of the chainrattling, the lock snapping, and the squeaky wheelsmoving off.                       WATSON                 (a sigh of relief)          I really thought we were done for.                                                         67.                       HOLMES                 (casually)          The art of concealment, my dear Watson,          is merely a matter of being in the right          place at the right time.They step forward, and through the painted shop windowwatch the old woman wheel herself down the street.                       GABRIELLE          Did you hear what she said? You really          think Emile is going to pick up the          letter himself?                       HOLMES          It certainly would simplify things,          wouldn't it?                       WATSON                 (shaking his head)          Maildrops and canaries and wheelchairs...          And what was all that about Jonah? And          what do you suppose they're doing up          there? And where is up there?                       HOLMES          My guess would be Scotland.   Inverness,          to be more precise.                       WATSON          Inverness?                       HOLMES          Didn't you notice the paper at the bottom          of their cage? The Inverness Courier.Gabrielle glances casually at the letter the old womanleft lying on top of the cage, and her expressionchanges.                       GABRIELLE          Mr. Holmes! This letter --                 (she picks it up)                       HOLMES          What about it?                       GABRIELLE                 (holding it out to him)          It's addressed to you.                                                           68.Holmes takes the letter, examines the envelope.    It isindeed addressed to him.                        HOLMES           Nevertheless --With the saw-end of his cane, he slits the envelope open,removes the enclosure, unfolds it. We see the letter inhis hand as he reads it out loud. The letterhead says:DIOGENES CLUB, St. James's, London.                        HOLMES                  (reading)           My Dear Sherlock: I expect you and Dr.           Watson to join me at the club immediately           upon reciept of this note. According to           my calculations, that should be at 11:40           a.m. Your brother, Mycroft.                  (looking up)           What time do you make it, Watson?                          WATSON                    (consulting watch)           11:43.                        HOLMES           Either your watch is wrong, or Mycroft           has miscalculated. And knowing Mycroft,           I suggest you reset your watch.Watson automatcially obeys.                                                DISSOLVE TO:EXT. DIOGENES CLUB - DAYHolmes, cane in hand, and Watson are swiftly ascendingthe steps of a building with an imposing Palladianfacade. Beside the entrance is a discreet sign reading:DIOGENES CLUB. Members Only. As they reach the top ofthe steps, Watson stops Holmes.                        WATSON           I don't mind telling you I'm a bit           apprehensive about this.                                                      69.                       HOLMES          I'm rather curious myself as to what is          going on in that Machiavellian mind of          his.                       WATSON          I don't mean Mycroft, I mean Madame          Valladon.                         HOLMES          Don't worry.    She's perfectly safe with          Mrs. Hudson.He opens the door and they start in.INT. LOBBY - DIOGENES CLUB - DAYDominating the lobby is a large statue of Queen Victoria.Presiding over the reception desk is a uniformed PORTERof military bearing, with one arm and a chest full ofcampaign ribbons. Holmes and Watson stride in.                       HOLMES                 (to porter)          To see Mr. Mycroft Holmes.                        PORTER          Right you are. He's expecting you in the          upstairs study. Now if you gentlemen          will sign in --                 (opens leather-bound                  register, turns it toward                  them)          Surname, Christian name, address, nature          of business --He holds out the pen to them, but they are gone. Helooks around in consternation, sees them hurrying up themajestic staircase, steps out from behind his desk.                       PORTER          Gentlemen...!READING ROOM - DIOGENES CLUB - DAYA huge room, with more marble than a mausoleum, and justabout as lively.                                                        70.A dozen elderly Establishment types are sunk deep in theleather armchairs, buried behind their copies of TheTimes.  Holmes and Watson are proceeding toward thestudy.  Suddenly Holmes stops beside one of the oldfossils, who has fallen asleep in his chair, The Times inhis lap, and between his fingers a lighted cigar with anash four inches long. Holmes picks up an ashtray, holdsit under the cigar -- just in time to catch the fallingash. As  he replaces the ashtray, he scrutinizes the ash.                        HOLMES           Jamaican, no doubt -- either Tropical or           Golosina -- I'm not quite sure.He and Watson continue toward the study door.INT. STUDY - DIOGENES CLUB - DAYIt is a very elegant room   -- shelves of leather-boundvolumes reach to the high   ceiling, there are antiqueterrestrial and celestial   gloves, scientific instrumentsin polished brass, marble   busts of English statesmen.MYCROFT HOLMES is standing at a refectory table, with hisback to the door, engaged in a curious operation. Adusty bottle of wine is held in an ingeniously engineeredcradle. As he turns the crank, the bottle tilts forwardgently, and he decants the wine into three glasseswithout disturbing the sediment.Mycroft is an impressive figure of a man, seven yearsolder than Sherlock, impeccably dressed. Behind hissnobbish airs and bantering manner, one senses tremendousreserves of strength and authority.The door opens, and Holmes and Watson enter.                        MYCROFT                  (without turning)           Come in, come in, Sherlock -- Dr.           Watson... Sit down.

How's your          gout?                       MYCROFT          Under control. Except for the occasional          twinge.He brings over two of the glasses of wine to Holmes andWatson.                       MYCROFT          I have a treat for you -- a very old          Madeira -- 1814. There are  only six          bottles left in the world.  I have two of          them, and am negotiating for a third.                       WATSON          If you don't mind my saying so, anybody          who's susceptible to gout shouldn't be --Mycroft has moved back to the table and picked up hisglass of Madeira.                       MYCROFT          The last doctor who warned me about that          was crossing Piccadilly, slipped on an          orange peel, and was run over by a          delivery van from the Fortnum and Mason.          Your very good health.He and Watson sip their drinks, but not Holmes.                       HOLMES          Why are you wasting this precious stuff          on us?                       MYCROFT          Well, I see you so rarely. How long has          it been? Not since the case of the Greek          interpreter.                 (to Watson)          Isn't it ridiculous? Two brothers living          in the same town...                       HOLMES          In the same town, perhaps -- but not the          same world.                                              72.               WATSON         (taking another sip)Mmmm.    Superb.

MYCROFTWell, I can save you a lot of trouble.             HOLMESI'd be grateful for any suggestion --             MYCROFTMy suggestion is that you pursue it nofurther.             HOLMESAny particular reason?             MYCROFTBecause it involves the nationalsecurity. We are handling this matterourselves.              WATSONWe?

MYCROFT          I didn't say that.                       HOLMES          I have always suspected that there was          some underground connection between this          stodgy and seemingly calcified          establishment and the Foreign Office in          Whitehall.                       MYCROFT          That's neither here nor there.                       HOLMES          It seems to me that The Diogenes Club is          here, there and everywhere. When there          are rumblings of revolt in the Sudan, an          expedition subsidized by your club          conveniently shows up to study the source          of the Nile. When there is trouble along          the Indian frontier, some of your fellow          members pop up in the Himalayas,          alledgedly looking for the Abominable          Snowman.A YOUNG MAN in morning coat and striped trousers comesin, holding a telegram. Mycroft crosses to him.                       MYCROFT                 (to Watson)          What a fertile imagination my brother          has. At the age of five, by          carefully observing a neighbor's house,          he deduced that babies were brought not          by the stork, but by the mid-wife in her          satchel.                       WATSON          As good an explanation as any.Mycroft has taken the telegram, and is coming forwardwith it. The young man clears his throat.                       MYCROFT          Yes, Wiggins?                                                      74.                       YOUNG MAN          An immediate answer is requested, sir.Mycroft inserts a monocle in his eye, opens the telegram,moves toward the desk reading it.                       MYCROFT          Tell them that the three boxes go to          Glennahurich, and the red runner goes to          the castle.                       YOUNG MAN          The three boxes to Glennahurich, the red          runner to the castle. Very good, sir.He exits. Holmes glances toward the telegram as Mycroftputs it down on his desk. Catching his look, Mycroftturns his telegram face-down, lets the monocle drop fromhis eye.                       HOLMES          Why don't you crumple it up and swallow          it -- to make sure.                       MYCROFT          My dear Sherlock, there  are certain          affairs that do not come  within the          province of the private  detective. They          have to be dealt with on  an altogether          different level.                       HOLMES          In other words, you want me to stay          within my limits.                         MYCROFT          I do indeed.                       HOLMES          Speaking of limits, what exactly is Jonah          Limited?                       MYCROFT          Sherlock, when I said drop this case, it          was not merely a suggestion -- it was an          order!                       HOLMES          By whose authority?                                                         75.                       MYCROFT          By the authority of Her Majesty's          government. I hope I've made myself          clear.                          WATSON          Perfectly.In his nervousness he drops his bowler, which rolls alongthe floor.                       MYCROFT          Now if you'll excuse me, gentlemen --                       WATSON          Goodbye, sir.                       HOLMES          A pleasure, as always.He and Watson retrieve their hats, move toward the door.                       MYCROFT                 (to Holmes)          Just a minute.                 (picks up Holmes' cane)          You forgot your tool-kit.He tosses the cane to Holmes, who catches it.                                                DISSOLVE TO:EXT.

Glen means valley, na          means of the, and Hurich, if memory          serves me, means yew tree.                       WATSON          You're just trying to impress me.

INVERNESS STATION - DAYThe Highland Express is pulling out of the station. Asthe last car disappears, and the steam clears from thetracks, we see Holmes, Gabrielle and Watson on theplatform. A BAGGAGEMAN is loading their luggage on ahand-cart, under Watson's supervision.                       WATSON          Let's see -- two, three, four --Gabrielle removes her parasol, which has been insertedunder the straps of her suitcase.                       GABRIELLE          I'll take that.                       HOLMES                 (to baggageman)          How do you get to Glennahurich?    How far          is it?                       BAGGAGEMAN          Glennahurich?                       WATSON          You know -- a valley -- with a yew          tree... ?Gabrielle casually opens her parasol.                       BAGGAGEMAN          It's about a mile out of town.                 (a beat)          Why would you be wanting to go there?                       WATSON          Well, if it's got a view, it might be a          nice place for a picnic.                       BAGGAGEMAN          It's got a view, right enough -- but it's          no place for a picnic.                       HOLMES          Why not?                       BAGGAGEMAN          Because it's a cemetary.                                                         87.Gabrielle looks at Holmes.

GLENNAHURICH CEMETARY - DAYUnder a leaden sky, the yew trees which give the placeits name brood over ancient gravestones.Holmes, Gabrielle and Watson come down an overgrown path,stop and look off.A rather meagre funeral procession is moving along theavenue which runs between the rows of graves. Itconsists of one normal-size pine coffin and two smallerones, loaded on a cart which is being wheeled by a coupleof workmen. Bringing up behind is a MINISTER, with anopen prayer book in his hands.                       WATSON                 (a note of excitement)          The three boxes. Is that it, Holmes?                       HOLMES          I would think so.                       GABRIELLE          The two small ones -- they must be          children's coffins.Holmes starts to cut across between the graves, Gabrielleand Watson following.At the grave-site, the workmen are removing the coffinsfrom the cart. There is one large grave, two smallerones. A couple of grave-diggers stand by respectfully,caps in hands.Holmes, Gabrielle and Watson come up behind a nearbyheadstone, stop and watch.At the grave-site, the minister is finishing the service.                       MINISTER          ... earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust          to dust.                                                         88.          In sure and certain hope of the          resurrection to eternal life through our          Lord, Jesus Christ. Amen.The workmen trundle the cart off, the minister following.The grave-diggers don their caps, pick up their shovels.From their vantage point, Holmes, Gabrielle and Watsonare watching.                         GABRIELLE          It's so sad.                       HOLMES          Sad -- and rather odd. There are no          flowers -- and no mourners.The grave-diggers have finished filling in the graveswhen Holmes, Gabrielle and Watson come up.                         HOLMES          Morning.                       GRAVE-DIGGER                 (looking up)          Morning.                       HOLMES          Working you hard, Dad?                       GRAVE-DIGGER          Not really. This is healthy country.          Sometimes you sit around for weeks with          nothing to do. Then you get three in one          day.                       HOLMES          What happened?                       GRAVE-DIGGER          An accident. Aye. Father and two sons,          they say -- they were found floating in          the loch.                       HOLMES          Local people?                       GRAVE-DIGGER          No. Nobody around here knows them. The          story is that their boat capsized in a          swell -- but I don't believe it.                                                       89.                       HOLMES          What do you believe?                       GRAVE-DIGGER          You may think I'm an old fool or an old          drunk -- but I've living around Loch Ness          all my life...                       WATSON          Are you trying to tell us it was the          monster?                       GRAVE-DIGGER          Damn right. MacLarnin saw the kids'          faces when they were pulled out of the          water -- looked like old men -- must've          died of fright.                        WATSON          Incredible.                       GRAVE-DIGGER          Is it? Last Easter Sunday my wife and          me, we were on our way to services, when          suddenly... But what's the use?He picks up a white-washed wooden cross, plants it at thehead of the grave. The other grave-digger has insertedsmaller crosses into the other two mounds of earth.                       HOLMES                 (taking some coins out of his                  pocket)          Here you are, Dad.                 (hands them to the grave-                  digger)                       GRAVE-DIGGER          Thank you... You look like nice people.          If you're wanting a holiday in Scotland,          go to Loch Lomond, go to Holy Loch -- but          stay away from Loch Ness.He and his partner shoulder their shovels, move off.                       WATSON                 (snorting)          To think that people still believe in          that nonsense. Here we are, living in          the Nineteenth Century --                                                       90.                       GABRIELLE          I'm ashamed to admit it -- but I was          relieved when he mentioned a father and          two boys. It could possibly have          anything to do with Emile.                       HOLMES          It would appear not.                       WATSON          However, there still remains the clue of          the castle and the red runner -- wherever          it may be.They are about to get under way when suddenly Holmesstops them.Coming down the avenue toward them are four small boys,in knickerbockers and caps, carrying bouquets of flowers.Without a word, Holmes draws Gabrielle and Watson back totheir hiding place, behind the headstone.The four boys approach the freshly-filled graves. Theyremove their caps, lay their flowers on each of the twosmall graves, then kneel down and bow their heads inprayer.From their position behind the headstone, Holmes, Watsonand Gabrielle are watching the four boys, who have theirbacks to them.                       WATSON          If they're unidentified graves, why are          those boys bringing flowers?                       HOLMES          Because it's their brothers who have just          been buried.                       WATSON          Their brothers?                       HOLMES          And they're not boys. They're as tall as          they'll ever grow. Hand me some pebbles,          will you?                       WATSON          Pebbles.                                                        91.He picks some up from the ground, hands them to Holmes,who tosses them in the direction of the graves. Thepebbles strike a granite cross. At the sound, the fourboys simultaneously turn their heads over theirshoulders. Despite their slight bodies they have thefeatures of mature men.Gabrielle and Watson react to the sight.                       GABRIELLE          They are -- how do you say it in English?          -- nains.                        WATSON          Midgets.

WATSON          I still don't see --                       HOLMES          Would it help if I told you they were          acrobats?                        WATSON          Not at all.                       HOLMES          Do you remember a tumbling act -- six          brothers -- missing from the circus?                       WATSON          Oh, yes -- that case you turned down -- I          completely forgot.                       HOLMES          Some of us are cursed with memories like          flypaper. And stuck there is a          staggering of miscellaneous date, mostly          useless.The four midgets have now risen, and putting on theircaps, move off down the avenue. Holmes, Gabrielle andWatson emerge from their place of concealment.                                                       92.                       GABRIELLE                 (worriedly)          Mr. Holmes, is those are not children,          then -- ?                       HOLMES          Quite. The question now is -- who's in          the third grave?                                                   CUT TO:EXT. GLENNAHURICH CEMETARY - NIGHTThe point of a crowbar digs under the edge of a coffinlid, which starts to give with a squealing protest ofnails. CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL Holmes, standing inthe large grave, from which the earth has been removed.Kneeling beside the grave, watching anxiously, areGabrielle and Watson, the latter holding a bullseyelantern.Holmes pries the lid open, disclosing the corpse of amiddle-aged man. His arms are folded across his chest,and on the third finger of his left hand is a weddingring similar to Gabrielle's. From the picture of him wehave seen earlier, we recognize the face as that of EmileValladon.Gabrielle lets out a piercing scream, collapses in afaint. Watson catches her.                        WATSON          Holmes!   She's fainted.                       HOLMES                 (preoccupied)          Hand me that lantern.Watson passes down the lantern, and Holmes slowly shinesthe beam along the length of the coffin.                       WATSON          It is Valladon, isn't it?                       HOLMES          Obviously. What is not so obvious is why          his wedding ring has turned green --                                                        93.The lantern beam now reveals that laid out at Valladon'sfeet are three canaries -- their plumage bleached a grey-white color.                       HOLMES          -- and why there are three dead canaries          in the coffin. White canaries.                                             DISSOLVE TO:EXT. CALEDONIAN HOTEL - DAWNAn open carriage is proceeding along the driveway towardthe hotel, scatting a flock of sheep grazing nearby.Watson is sitting beside the coachman. Holmes andGabrielle are in the passenger seat, their luggage isstrapped to the back. Through the trees which line theroad we glimpse Loch Ness, which is partly obscured by alow-lying mist.The carriage pulls up in front of the hotel, which isidentified by a sign above the entrance, and Holmes,Watson and Gabrielle get out.CLOSE SHOT - HOTEL REGISTERHolmes' hand is writing: Mr. And Mrs. Ashdown and valet,London.INT.

The only concrete lead we          have is the reference to the castle --                 (picks up guide book from                  desk, opens it to map)          The question is, which castle?

Amidst the rubble of theNether Bailey, an encampment of tents has been set up.Holmes, Gabrielle and Watson come bicycling up along afence on the heights overlooking the castle, dismount infront of the locked gates.

I particularly wanted my wife          to see Urquhart Castle. The tower is one          of the most interesting examples of --          about 1400, wasn't it?

WATSON          Pleasant sort, isn't he?                       HOLMES          Pleasant, but ignorant. He was off one          hundred years and one James.                 (taps guide-book in his                  pocket)          It's actually 1500 and James the Fourth.                       GABRIELLE          If he's an official guide, shouldn't he          know... ?                       HOLMES          If he's an official guide.They have now reached the wall against which they lefttheir bicycles. Suddenly Holmes stops, attracted by thesound of birds chirping.                        HOLMES          Listen...   Do you hear anything, Watson?                       WATSON                 (concentrating)          No. Those birds are making too much of a          racket.                       HOLMES                 (looking off)          They're not just birds -- they're our old          friends.Watson and Gabrielle follow his gaze.From the back of the wagon, the carriers have removed thesmall bird-cage we saw in the mail-drop on AshdownStreet. They hand it to a workman, who starts up thesteps with it. To another couple of workmen they passdown an open-sided crate in which rest two heavy glassbottles protected by wicker. Stencilled on the woodenslate of the crate are the words: SULPHURIC ACID -CORROSIVE.                                                         104.Holmes is watching thoughtfully, Gabrielle and Watson arepuzzled.                          WATSON             Sulphuric acid?                          GABRIELLE             The more we find out the less sense it             makes.                          HOLMES             To a graduate chemist it makes a great             deal of sense. Sulphuric acid, when             exposed to salt-water, produces chlorine             gas.                    (a beat)             Would you mind clasping your hands,             Watson?                          WATSON                    (obeying)             Like this?                          HOLMES             A little lower... Thank you.Watson has lowered his clasped hands, and Holmes usesthem as a foothold to go scrambling up the scaffolding ofthe nearby wall. Reaching the top, he looks off in thedirection of the tower.The workman carrying the canary cage, and the twocarrying the crate of sulphuric acid are approaching thetower. A draw-bridge comes down, and the three men crossthe moat and enter the tower.                          HOLMES                    (looking off)             That tower may be more interesting than I             thought -- and not just architecturally.Out of the ruined gatehouse comes the guard with the twomastiffs on leashes. The dogs start to snarl viciously.                          WATSON             Holmes, I have a feeling we're redundant             here.                                                      105.Holmes leaps down from the scaffolding, wheels the tandemaround, starts back in the direction from which theycame. Gabrielle follows. Watson hurries after them withhis bicycle, casting anxious glances over his shoulder asthe dogs continue barking.                                             DISSOLVE TO:EXT. LOCH NESS - EARLY EVENINGThe sun has just gone down behind the hills, but there isstill light in the sky. An ominous mist is beginning tosettle on the water.Gabrielle is sitting in the stern of a rowboat, herparasol in her lap. She is wearing Holmes' Norfolkjacket over her dress to ward off the chill.On the rowing seat, facing her, are Watson and Holmes,the latter in his waistcoat. Their oars are pulled in,and they are watching Urquhart Castle, on the oppositeside of the lake.                       WATSON          We have now observed the castle from the          front, from the back, from the side, from          land, from water... what now?  Are you          planning to spend the night out here?                       HOLMES          If necessary.                       WATSON          You're going to catch your death of cold.                 (to Gabrielle)          Wouldn't it be ironic if Holmes' last          case were a case of pneumonia?                 (with an embarrassed chuckle)          Sorry.Gabrielle glances past them, and her eyes widen.                       GABRIELLE                 (pointing off)          What's that?Holmes and Watson turn their heads.                                                      106.About half a mile away, moving in and out of patches ofdrifting mist, is Watson's monster, its long reptillianneck cutting through the water.Watson leaps to his feet.                        WATSON          Holmes!Holmes grabs his arm, pulls him back into his seat.                       HOLMES          Quick, Watson. After it!He grabs his oar, and Watson belatedly joins in. Theystrain at the oars, setting a course which will interceptthe monster.  Gabrielle leans forward in her seat, tryingto peer past them through the curtains of mist.The monster is much closer now -- no more than a quarterof a mile away.Suddenly Watson stops rowing.                       WATSON          Holmes, what are we doing?   We should be          going away from it.                       HOLMES          Keep rowing, dammit!Watson resumes pulling on his oar.   As they row, Holmeslooks over his shoulder.The monster has started to submerge. Its head disappearsbeneath the surface of the water, and the wake it leavesbehind soon trails off into the mist.Holmes ships his oar.                       HOLMES          We've lost it.

The backwashhits the boat broadside, rocking it, and Holmes, Watsonand Gabrielle are spilled into the lake.The monster moves away from them, heading in the generaldirection of the castle. It disappears into the mist.Holmes is the first to come up, looks around, seesGabrielle surfacing a few yards away, swims to her.

Just to scare people?             HOLMESNot very likely.                                                      111.                       GABRIELLE          Why did they try to keep me from finding          my husband? And why was he buried          anonymously?                       HOLMES          I think I have a pretty good notion of          what they're up to -- the Society for the          Preservation of Scottish Monuments --          better known as the Diogenes Club.                       WATSON          The Diogenes Club?There is a knock on the door.                       HOLMES          Come in.The door opens and the hotel manager enters, holding amagnum of champagne.                       MANAGER          Mr. Ashdown, I have a bottle of champagne          for you.                       HOLMES                 (crossing to him)          A bottle of champagne? I didn't order          it.                       MANAGER          No, indeed. You are to deliver it.          These are my instructions.He hands the magnum to Holmes.                       HOLMES          Instructions from whom?   Deliver it          where?                       MANAGER          I wouldn't know, sir. But there's a          carriage waiting for you downstairs.                       HOLMES          Are you sure you have the right Mr.          Ashdown?                                                       112.                       MANAGER                 (flatly)          Quite sure, Mr. Holmes.He turns and exits.   Holmes taps the bottle of champagnethoughtfully.                       HOLMES          Well, Watson, I would say the curtain is          going up on the last act.                       WATSON          I don't like the sound of it.                       GABRIELLE          Please be careful.As Holmes starts toward the door, Watson reaches into hissporran.                       WATSON          You'd better take this with you.He produces a revolver, holds it out to Holmes.    Holmesignores it, exits.EXT. CALEDONIAN HOTEL - NIGHTA gig is waiting in front of the entrance, and leaningagainst it is the guide we saw earlier at Urquhart.Holmes comes out, carrying the champagne bottle.                       HOLMES          Who's minding the castle?                       GUIDE          You'd better get on.     It's late.Holmes climbs into the gig, and the guide moutns the seatbeside him.                       HOLMES          Where are we going?    Some sort of party?                       GUIDE          You won't be disappointed in the guest          list.                                                       113.                       HOLMES          Who's the host?                          GUIDE          Jonah.He flicks the reins. The horse starts off at a trot, andthe gig turns into the driveway.EXT. MOVING GIG - NIGHTAs they drive along, Holmes glances at the guide, who isgrim and uncommunicative.                                             DISSOLVE TO:EXT. ROAD LEADING TO CASTLE - NIGHTThe gig, with its two passengers, proceeds along thelakeshore, approaching the entrance to Urquhart.EXT. URQUHART CASTLE - NIGHTA workman is lighting a couple of torches attached to theruined gatehouse when the gig comes through the archway.The guide reins up the horse in front of the stepsleading to the inner courtyard -- which are now coveredwith a narrow red carpet.The guide nods to Holmes, who dismounts, starts up thesteps, examining the red carpet. As he reaches the top,he looks off.The strip of red carpet runs across the courtyard, lit bytorches planted in the ground. A couple of workmen areare unrolling the rest of the carpet toward the entranceof the tower.As Holmes passes one of the tents, the flap opens andMycroft steps out, dressed in his inevitable frock coat.                       MYCROFT          Mr. Ashdown, I presume.                       HOLMES                 (turning)          The red runner, I presume.                                                       114.                 (indicates carpet)          You shouldn't have gone to all this          trouble just for me.                       MYCROFT          It's not for you.                 (calling into tent)          McKeller.                 (to Holmes)          May I have the champagne, please?                       HOLMES                 (handing him bottle)          1886 -- not a very good vintage, is it?                        MYCROFT          Mediocre.   But then again, it's not for          drinking.A black-suited MAN emerges from the ten, and Mycroftgives him the champagne.                       MYCROFT          Tie it up, will you?The man moves off toward the tower.   Mycroft pulls backthe flap of the tent.                       MYCROFT          In here.Holmes passes inside, Mycroft following.INT. TENT - NIGHTIt is lit by a kerosene lamp suspended from the ridge-pole. There are several cots, one of them with thebedding rolled up. Resting on the stripped cot is atrunk with the name E. VALLADON painted on it. Lying ona table, among a group of engineering models, areGabrielle's parasol and Watson's stethoscope. There arealso a couple of drafting tables, with plans andblueprints tacked to them.Holmes moves around the tent, taking all this in.                       HOLMES          Interesting -- and educational.                                             115.             MYCROFTDespite my most emphatic warning, youpersisted in meddling. It would haveserved you right if you'd all drowned.             HOLMESSorry to be so unobliging.       (stops beside torch)E. Valladon... H'mm.             MYCROFT       (indicating parasol   and        stethoscope)I imagine this belongs to    the prettylady, and this belongs to    your valet...We found them floating in    the lake.             HOLMESSpeaking about things floating in thelake --             MYCROFTHow much do you know -- or think youknow?             HOLMESI think you're testing some sort ofunderwater craft -- camouflauged tomislead the gullible. I think it's anexperimental model, operated by a crew ofmidgets. I think it is powered bysulphuric acid batteries, and usescanaries to detect escaping gas...Altogether a strange contraption.             MYCROFTNot quite that unique. Right now, fourcountries are trying to develop what wecall a submersible. But none of themcould solve the critical problem -- howto stay submerged long enough to make iteffective.             HOLMESWhat does the Good Book say? "And Jonahlived in the belly of that fish for threedays and three nights."                                            116.             MYCROFTThat was our goal. And thanks toValladon's air-pump, we got a jump on therest of them. It's a highly complexsystem of filtration -- so we had aseries of trials --             HOLMESAnd at least one error.             MYCROFTDuring a test run in Moray Firth,pressure caused a leak in the hull. Seawater mixed with the acid in thebatteries to produce chlorine gas.Before they could reach the surface,Valladon and the crew were dead.             HOLMESSo you had them buried in unmarkedgraves, to preserve your secret.             MYCROFTIt was essential to keep the informationfrom your client.             HOLMESYou went to all those lengths to preventMadame Valladon from fiding her husband?             MYCROFTYour client isn't Madame Valladon -- it'sthe Imperial German Government. Theywere after the Belgian engineer -- orrather, his invention. They knew he wasemployed by us, but they couldn't findout where -- so they enlisted the bestbrain in England to help them. You, mydear brother, have been working for theWilhelmstrasse.             HOLMESAnd Madame Valladon -- what part did sheplay in all this?             MYCROFTMadame Valladon is dead.            HOLMESDead?                                                       117.Mycroft crosses to the trunk, opens the lid.                       MYCROFT          The Germans disposed of her three weeks          ago, in Brussels. This is Gabrielle          Valladon.He hands Holmes a small, framed photograph. Holmes looksat it with apprehension, as well he should: the pictureis of a somewhat matronly woman, not the glamorousGabrielle. Holmes lowers  the photograph. Behind it,Mycroft is glaring at him with customary arrogance.                       MYCROFT          The woman who was brought to your house          in the middle of the night -- apparently          fished out of the Thames -- and          apparently suffering from amnesia -- is,          in fact, Ilse von Hoffmanstal, one of          their most skillful agents. Am I going          too fast for one of the "best brains in          England?"                        HOLMES          Go on.As Mycroft continues, Holmes picks up Ilse's water-soakedparasol and examines it.                       MYCROFT          They planted her on you quite neatly, I          must admit, so that you could lead them          to their objective, the air pump. Very          much like using a hog to find truffles.          And now perhaps you'd care to join me. I          am expecting a certain royal personage          from Balmoral.EXT. CASTLE - NIGHTA coach and escort approach the castle. Painted on thedoor of the coach are the initials "V.R."INT. CASTLE COURTYARDThe entourage enters the castle courtyard and stops.Footmen open the door and bow to the lone passenger.                                                     118.Waiting on top of the steps, outside the tent, areMycroft and Holmes. Lined up on the other side of thetorch-lit red carpet are half a dozen scientists, intheir best clothes.Out of the coach steps a familiar figure -- Her Majesty,QUEEN VICTORIA, Defender of the Faith, Empress of India.She is 69 years old, and dressed entirely in black.Mycroft comes down the carpeted steps to meet her.                       MYCROFT          Your Majesty.He bows. The Queen extends her hand to him, and hetouches it.                       MYCROFT          I trust you had a pleasant journey,          Ma'am.                       QUEEN VICTORIA          It was long and it was tedious. And it          had better be worth our while, Mr.          Holmes.                       MYCROFT          I can assure you, Ma'am, it will be.A lady-in-waiting and a uniformed equerry have nowdescended from the coach. Mycroft leads the party up thesteps.                       QUEEN VICTORIA          Now what is this curious ship we are          supposed to christen?                       MYCROFT          We call it a submersible, Ma'am.    It          travels under water.                         QUEEN VICTORIA          Under water?    What a fantastic idea.They have now reached the top of the steps.                                            119.

HOLMESI'm afraid it was rather negligible, YourMajesty.                                                     120.                       MYCROFT                 (to the Queen)          This is my brother, Sherlock, Ma'am.                       QUEEN VICTORIA          Ah, yes. Sherlock Holmes. We have been          following your exploits with great          interest.Holmes bows, touches the Queen's extended hand.                       HOLMES          Thank you, Ma'am.                       QUEEN VICTORIA          Are you engaged in one of your          fascinating cases at the moment?                       HOLMES          In a manner of speaking, Ma'am.                       QUEEN VICTORIA          When can we expect to read Dr. Watson's          account of the case?                       HOLMES          I hope never, Ma'am. It has not been one          of my more successful endeavors.Mycroft signals to a bagpiper, who starts playing HIELAN'LADDIE.                       QUEEN VICTORIA          Ah, the ceremonies are about to begin.                 (to Mycroft)          Now where is this underwater ship of          yours?                       MYCROFT                 (pointing to tower)          In the dungeon, Ma'am.                       QUEEN VICTORIA          The dungeon? What a peculiar place to          keep it.                 (turning to the others)          Well, let us get on with it, gentlemen.                                                     121.Mycroft leads the Queen along the red runner toward thetower. Holmes follows, then the lady-in-waiting and theequerry, then the scientists.As they cross the inner courtyard, the Highland piperfalls in ahead of the procession, leads them toward thedrawbridge. Then he steps aside,  as the royal partycrosses the drawbridge and passes through the door of thetower.INT. DUNGEON - NIGHTA high-ceilinged rock chamber, with a spiral ironstaircase leading down. The floor is a concrete ramp,the lower end of it covered with water. Beyond is theentrance from the Loch, camouflaged by scaffolding andvegetation.On the upper part of the ramp is a small, primitivesubmarine, resting on wheels. Prominently lettered onthe bow is the name H.M.S. JONAH, and suspended by a ropefrom the prow is the magnum of champagne which Holmesdelivered. Along the sides are torpedo tubes, and fittedover the conning tower is the head and neck of the"monster" we saw in the lake.Present are half a dozen naval personnel, commanded by anofficer. As the royal party comes down the spiralstaircase, the officer snaps to attention. Mycroft is inthe lead, followed by the Queen, Holmes, the lady-in-waiting, the equerry and the scientists.                       MYCROFT          There she, Ma'am. Her Majesty's Ship          Jonah.The four surviving midgets appear on the deck, in wooljerseys and navy caps. They start pulling on a chainwhich slowly raises the detachable head-and-neck of themonster toward the ceiling, disclosing the conning towerand the periscope.                       QUEEN VICTORIA          And what, may we ask, is the purpose of          that hideous gargoyle?                       MYCROFT          It's merely a decoy, Ma'am.                                                      122.                      QUEEN VICTORIA          Oh. To frighten away the sharks, we          imagine.                       MYCROFT          Something of the sort... The crew will          now demonstrate the workings of the          submersible.A SAILOR of normal height appears on the deck of the sub.                       SAILOR          Stand to.The midgets scramble down the hatch.                       QUEEN VICTORIA          Aren't they rather small for sailors?                       MYCROFT          They are. But because of the size of the          craft, the Navy made an exception.                       QUEEN VICTORIA          They should make it a rule. It's quite          fatiguing to pin on all those medals          while standing on our toes.There is the sound of the engines starting. Mycroftleads the Queen to an open bulkhead in the side of thesub, with Holmes and rest of the party close behind.Inside, all is noise and confusion. Metal rods aredipping into glass jars of sulphuric acid, complicatedmachinery is driving the propeller shaft, bellows areinflating and deflating, etc. The midgets are at theirstations in the cramped quarters, pulling switches,oiling the engines, operating the periscope. Overhead isa cageful of canaries, all chirping away. Mycroft pointsout the various features to the Queen.                       MYCROFT          This is the main engine, which propels it          under water at the rate of two knots --          the stabilizing mechanism -- the multi-          stage compressor -- the ballast tank          trimmer -- the air-pump which filters and          recirculates the air --                                                      123.                       QUEEN VICTORIA          How charming.                       MYCROFT          The air pump, Ma'am?                       QUEEN VICTORIA                 (pointing)          The canaries. Must make the crew feel at          home.                       MYCROFT          Yes, Ma'am. These are the levers for          firing the torpedoes, which are accurate          up to as much as 120 feet -- the          periscope for scanning the surface of the          water --                       QUEEN VICTORIA          But where is the glass bottom?                       MYCROFT          The what, Ma'am?                       QUEEN VICTORIA          The glass bottom.                       HOLMES          You know -- to see the fist --                       QUEEN VICTORIA          -- and the plants and the corals --                       MYCROFT          That's not quite the idea, Ma'am. H.M.S.          Jonah is being commissioned as a warship.                       QUEEN VICTORIA          A warship?                 (waving her hand)          Stop that noise. Stop it!At a signal from Mycroft, the sub engines are turned off.                       MYCROFT          Ma'am, if I may explain --                       QUEEN VICTORIA          You had better.                                                     124.                       MYCROFT          The Admiralty regards this craft as the          ultimate weapon in naval warfare. It can          seek out enemy ships and destroy them --          with these torpedoes -- while remaining          completely invisible.                       QUEEN VICTORIA          You mean in can fire at other vessels          while under water?                        MYCROFT          Yes, Ma'am.                       QUEEN VICTORIA          Without any warning?                       MYCROFT          That is correct, Ma'am.                       QUEEN VICTORIA          And without showing her colors?                       MYCROFT          Indeed, Ma'am.                       QUEEN VICTORIA          Mr. Holmes, we are not amused.                 (Mycroft stares at her)          It is unsportsmanlike, it is un-English,          and it is in very poor taste. We will          have none of it!                       MYCROFT          I beg your pardon, Ma'am?He exchanges a look with Holmes.                       QUEEN VICTORIA          Sometimes we despair of the state of the          world. What will scientists think of          next?                       MYCROFT          That's precisely it, Ma'am. At this very          moment the Germans under Count von          Zeppelin, are experimenting with a          dirigible --                                                      125.                      QUEEN VICTORIA          A dirigible? And what, pray, is that?                       MYCROFT          A rigid balloon, which could fly over          London and drop a bomb on Buckingham          Palace. It is being developed at the          express orders of Kaiser Wilhelm the          Second.                       QUEEN VICTORIA          Nonsense. We refuse to believe that our          grandson Willie would do a thing like          that.                       MYCROFT          We have conclusive proof, Ma'am. Our          agent in Friedrichshafen, a man named          Ibbetson, actually saw the dirigible, and          made a drawing of it. Unfortunately, he          was apprehended before he could cross the          border.                       QUEEN VICTORIA                 (indicating sub)          Nevertheless, we don't want any part of          this beastly invention. Get rid of it!          Scuttle it! The sooner the better.                       MYCROFT          May I point out, Ma'am --                       QUEEN VICTORIA          And don't concern yourself about that          dirigible dropping bombs on us. We shall          write a very sharp note to the Kaiser.                 (to equerry)          Now we wish to return to Balmoral.She starts toward the spiral staircase. The equerryprecedes her up the stairs, the lady-in-waiting follows,the scientists trail after them. Mycroft and Holmeslinger behind.                       HOLMES          Well, Mycroft, it seems we have both been          undone by a woman.                 (Mycroft is staring at the                  sub)          What a shame.                                                        126.          All that superb engineering, and all that          cunning espionage, for nought.                       MYCROFT          Not necessarily. If the Germans want          that submersible so badly, why don't we          give it to them?                       HOLMES          Give it to them?                       MYCROFT          Invite them aboard for the final journey          -- seven hundred feet -- straight down.                       HOLMES          And how are you going to arrange that?                       MYCROFT          I'm rather counting on you to do it.          Since you are on such intimate terms with          Fraulein von Hoffmanstal.O.s., the bagpiper resumes playing.                       MYCROFT          Shall we say goodbye to Her Majesty?He starts up the spiral staircase.    Holmes follows slowlyand thoughtfully.                                               DISSOLVE TO:EXT.

But as long as you're          up -- what is the German word for castle?          Schloss, isn't it?                       GABRIELLE                 (carefully)          I think so.                       HOLMES          And how would you say under the castle?          Unter das Schlss? Or die Schloss?                       GABRIELLE          I don't know. My German isn't that good.                       HOLMES                 (indicating)          Your Trappist friends are out there          waiting to hear from you -- it's a chilly          morning -- we don't want to keep them          standing around too long, do we, Fraulein          Hoffmanstal?                 (Gabrielle looks at him                  without answering)          Come now. It's too late to play cat and          mouse.                       GABRIELLE                 (flatly)          Unter dem Schloss.                                                        128.                         HOLMES            Thank you.                   (holding out parasol)            Here's your signalling device -- it's a            bit damp, I'm afraid -- would you care to            let them know where they can find the            submersible?                   (Gabrielle makes no move to                    take the parasol)            No? Then I'll just have to do it myself.                   (moving toward window)            I only hope my Morse code is adequate to            the occasion.Keeping well to one side of the open window, he extendsthe parasol outside, opens it, starts sending out aseries of long and short signals.LAKEFRONT - DAWNvon Tirpitz and the other monks strain their eyes in thedirection of the hotel.HOTEL - FROM MONKS' ANGLE - DAWNOutside the hotel window, Gabrielle's parasol can be seenflashing the message UNTER DEM SCHLOSS in Morse code --but it is not apparent that Holmes is doing thesignalling.INT.

Youcan consider your part of the missionaccomplished, Fraulein Hoffmanstal.             GABRIELLEYou're all wrong about me.   My name isn'tHoffmanstal.            HOLMESIt isn't?             GABRIELLEIt's von Hoffmanstal.             HOLMESI stand corrected.             GABRIELLE       (glancing toward window)I suppose once they're in the castle...It must amuse you, Mr. Holmes, Trappistswalking into a trap.             HOLMESIt's more amusing than that. Once in thecastle, they will encounter surprisinglylittle resistance -- it will take but asmall bottle of chloroform to overcomethe guards.             GABRIELLE       (skeptically)You mean you're going to let them havethe air-pump?             HOLMESBetter than that. We're going to letthem have the submersible. They willfind it with its engines running, all setto go. I assume they're all expertsailors? And since there is a Germanbattleship cruising off the coast ofScotland, I expect they'll try to sail itout of the lock and rendezvous at sea.             GABRIELLEDid you say try to?                                                      130.                       HOLMES          I would suggest you get your things          together. Mycroft will be here to take          you into custody.He opens her suitcase, which is on the baggage rack atthe foot of the bed. Gabrielle watches him for a beat,then crosses to the wardrobe, starts taking her clothesout.                       GABRIELLE          I never had you fooled for a moment, did          I? You knew right from the beginning --          when the cabbie brought me to Baker          Street.                       HOLMES          Let me see -- not quite that soon.He stretches out on the bed.                       GABRIELLE          It's so funny. I asked for this          assignment, you know. I was scheduled to          go to Japan, but I couldn't resist the          challenge of coming up against the best.          I'm sorry I didn't give you a closer          game.                       HOLMES          Close enough.                       GABRIELLE          You're just being kind.   I failed          miserably.                       HOLMES          We all have occasional failures.          Fortunately, Dr. Watson never writes          about mine.                                               DISSOLVE TO:INT.

HOLMES          I appreciate that, Watson.

Watson takes a lump of sugar outof the bowl with a pair of tongs, drops it into hiscoffee.                                                        137.Then glancing over his shoulder to make sure Holmes isn'twatching, he swivels the letter around with the tongs.It is written on Diogenes Club stationery, and reads:                                   9th December, 1888          Dear Sherlock,            My sources in Tokyo inform me that Ilse          von Hoffmanstal was arrested last week by          the Japanese counter-intelligence service          for spying on naval installations in          Yokohama harbour. After a secret trial,          she was summarily executed by a firing          squad.            It might interest you to know thatThe page ends at this point. Watson turns the sheet ofpaper over with the tongs. The letter continues on theother side.          she had been living in Japan these past          few months under the name of Mrs.          Ashdown.                       Sincerely,                       MycroftWatson looks toward Holmes, who is still standing withhis back to the room, gets up from the table.                       WATSON          Holmes -- I'm terribly sorry about this.                       HOLMES                 (quietly, without turning)          Where is it, Watson?                       WATSON                 (after a beat)          In the files. May to July, 1885.Holmes turns to the bookshelves above the desk.   From arow of similar volumes, he slides out the three  filesmarked MAY, JUNE, and JULY 1885. Actually, it's   themedical bag, standing on end, with the spines of  threevolumes pasted on the bottom.                       HOLMES          You're getting better.                                                      138.He sets the bag down on the desk, opens it, takes out abottle of cocaine. Watson watches him with compassion ashe crosses to his bedroom with his cocaine, goes in,shuts the door.Footsteps are heard hurrying up the stairs, and after amoment there is a knock on the door. Watson approachesthe door, opens it to reveal INSPECTOR LESTRADE -- ashort, nervous man whose features are sharper than hismind. He is wearing an overcoat, his bowler is in hishands, and his fingers are drumming on the crown.                       LESTRADE          Good morning, Watson.                 (stepping in)          Just happened to be in the neighborhood,          and I thought --                       WATSON          What is it this time, Inspector Lestrade?                       LESTRADE          We've had three rather nasty murders in          Whitechapel. All ladies of  easy virtue.          You may read something about it -- the          newspapers are referring to the killer as          Jack the Ripper.                       WATSON          Yes, I think I have.                       LESTRADE          Some of us at Scotland Yard were          wondering if perhaps Mr. Holmes would be          willing to --                       WATSON                 (a glance toward the bedroom)          I'm sorry, Lestrade. But at the moment,          Holmes is working on another problem.                       LESTRADE                 (trying to hide his                  disappointment)          Oh... Well, I just thought it was the          kind of case that might interest him. I          dare say we can solve it without his          help.                                                     139.                       WATSON          Oh, I'm sure you will.From Holmes' bedroom comes the sound of a melancholy tunebeing played on the violin. Watson starts to easeLestrade out of the door.                       WATSON          Good day, Lestrade.He shuts the door after him, listens to the sound of theviolin for a moment. Then he crosses to the wickerchair, seats himself. He takes some sheets of paper outof the rack and places them on the writing arm, dips hispen in the inkwell, starts to write.The violin music continues OVER SCENE, infinitelyromantic, infinitely sad.                                                FADE OUT.                         THE END
