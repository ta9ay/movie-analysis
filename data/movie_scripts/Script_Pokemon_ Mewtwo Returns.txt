Movie: MewTwo Strikes Back ***This is not an official manuscript. This is a translation of an untranslated episode and is only released as a reference material to the pokÈmon series and games. All copyrights belong to Nintendo, Game Freaks, and all creators of the movie***	(Opens when the camera is underwater.)VoiceWho am I? I've been dreaming about this world which doesn't exist in my memory. 	(Mew swims by)Who are you? Wait! Am I apart of you...? Or not...?	(Camera goes into a darker place with orange bubbles then it shows someone's eye open. Human figures are seen outside where he is.)Where is this? Who am I? Who brought me here?		(We now see who the voice belongs to, it's Mewtwo.)MewtwoWho am I and why am I here? I just appeared here. I haven't even been born to this world yet. Who am I?	(Mewtwo opens his eyes completely and shatters the glass and all the wires fall of him!)ScientistIt has awakened!MewtwoDid he do this? ScientistWonderful! Mewtwo has been completed.   MewtwoMewtwo?ScientistThat's you. We created you from a Mew the rarest pokÈmon in the world! Yes, that's the pokÈmon which is said to be the most rare of all pokÈmon. Mew.MewtwoMew? Is that my parent? My father? My mother?ScientistYou can say that, but not really. You've been made stronger based on a Mew.MewtwoWho is this? If neither my father nor mother. Then was it god? Did God create me?ScientistIn the world the only ones that can create new life is man and god.MewtwoWho did this? Humans made me?ScientistThis is truly a victory for science.Another scientistWith this we've proven our theory correct. We can continue the study.Third scientistThis place will become the new Mecca.Scientist	(all shaking hands)I'm going to contact the other offices.MewtwoWho am I? Where is this place? What was I born for?	(Mewtwo floats up and starts destroying the whole lab. Then tons of little metal hand like things come down to stop him but he just blows them up. Soon the whole lab is in flames.)ScientistTo make the strongest pokÈmon ever.. that was our dream...	(The whole lab blows up. Giovanni, the leader of Team Rocket comes down in a chopper and confronts Mewtwo.)MewtwoIs this my power? I'm the strongest pokÈmon in the world. Mew. Am I stronger then you?GiovanniYou surly are the strongest pokÈmon in the world. But there is another that would be the strongest.MewtwoThe humans?Giovanni	(nods)If you and a human were to cooperate then the world would be ours.  MewtwoThe world would be ours?GiovanniIf your power is set free the world would be ruined. You must control your power.MewtwoControl?GiovanniAre you okay with destroying the world as it is with that power?MewtwoWhat should I do? 	(Giovanni smiles. Mewtwo is at TRHQ getting loads of armor put on.)MewtwoControl myself with the armor that protects me? What are you going to make me do?GiovanniIt's simple. All you have to do are the things everyone else has been doing...Mewtwoand that is?GiovanniFighting, destruction, and plunder. The stronger will win.--------------------------------------------------------Mewtwo is sent into an arena to fight pokÈmon first an Onix which Mewtwo throws into a wall with his mind. Then it shows Mewtwo out in a field with a lot of wild Tauros. He raises them up with his mind control and TR throws pokÈballs out and catches them all. Then it shows Mewtwo in the gym again fighting Alakazam, Mewtwo does just what he did to Onix. Then came Electron and he used an electric attack and Mewtwo reflected it back at him. Next came Gary's Arcanine and Nidoking... he took care of them easily. Next scene, back in Giovanni's lab.--------------------------------------------------------MewtwoWhat am I fighting for? What am I living for?GiovanniYou are a pokÈmon. PokÈmon made by humans, what else are you worth?MewtwoMy worth? Who am I? What do I live for?	(Mewtwo starts breaking free of the wires)GiovanniWhat are you doing?MewtwoI was made by humans. But I, who was created by humans, am not even a pokÈmon.	(Mewtwo blows up the place and flies off while all his armor slowly falls of into the sea. He lands on a rock.)Who am I? Where is this place? Who asked to make me? Who wished to make me? I hate everything that made me! So this is neither an attack not a declaration of war but revenge on you who made me!----------------------------------------------------Introduction----------------------------------------------------	(Brock is cooking lunch for everyone.)NarratorAsh and the others are on a journey training to be pokÈmon masters. It's a beautiful day so they take a break in a field.AshIs it ready yet?MistyAsh you can help too.AshI can't I can't even move one millimeter because I'm so starved.BrockStew well and raise slowly. You mustn't be in a rush with both soup or pokÈmon.	(Pikachu and Togepy spot someone coming)PirateHey you! The boy over there! Are you Ash from Pallet Town?AshThat's right.PirateCan I have a PokÈmon battle with you?Ash	(runs over to him)Okay! I must have a solid fight!MistyI thought you couldn't move one millimeter?AshJust one or two pokÈmon fights before breakfast.BrockThis is lunch, so that would be before lunch.Pikachupika..chu...	(Has the Japanese PokÈmon intro music through this battle the whole time. Ash pulls out a pokÈball and throws out Bulbasaur. Then the pirate throws out Donfan. Bulbasaur charges and Donfan rolls into a ball and hits Bulbasaur, then turns around and hits him again! Then he tries it again but Bulbasaur uses Solar Beam and Donfan faints. The Pirate then sends out Machamp. Ash sends out Squirtle. Machamp kicks Squirtle down and then goes to kick him again but Squirtle dodges it and bubbles him till Machamp faints. The pirate gets mad and throws 3 pokÈballs down. one is a Venomoth another is a Golem and the other is a Pinsir. Pikachu jumps off ashes shoulder and does Thundershock and all 3 faint.)   PirateOh My God! 	(this was possibly the funniest part of the entire movie :)AshI did it!MistyIt was just because your opponent was weak.BrockHe didn't even raise them well	(flash to Team Rocket who is on a cliff watching our heroes.)JamesPikachu gets stronger and stronger.JessieBeautifulMeowthWe couldn't beat him even once. But the word surrender isn't in our dictionary.JessieI will get that Pikachu.JamesBut look at that. 	(looks at them all eating)MeowthI'm so hungry.JessieI got a frying pan...MeowthWhat good is such a thing without meat and vegetables? It's just an iron board.---------------------------------------------A Fearow with a camera flies over head then it shows inside some place where you can see Ash and Pikachu on the screens.---------------------------------------------     LadyAre you sending them an invitation?MewtwoCertainly.	(Dragonite flies out of the control center with a purse. It flies over the sees and then over Team Rocket and they fall then it flies over Ash and everyone's head knocking them all over then she lands.)AshWhat are you? 	(Dragonite hands Ash an invitation)This? For me?	(He hits a button and a hologram of the lady is displayed)LadyPlease forgive me for the abrupt letter.BrockWhat a beautiful lady...LadySince you are a promising pokÈmon trainer of the future, we'd like to invite you to a party of my master who is the strongest pokÈmon trainer in the world. The place is the New Island, PokÈmon Castle. Please check the reply card for whether your coming or not. Please accept the invitation for the strongest trainer in the world.BrockBeautiful Lady...MistyWhat do we do?BrockLets go for it. We should go for it.AshI don't feel uncomfortable with being told I'm a promising future trainer.MistyWell then check yes on the card.	(They check yes, and hand the invitation back to Dragonite. Dragonite takes the card and flies off but Jessie, James and Meowth take out a net in an attempt to steal this rare pokÈmon. Ash's invitation falls out of Dragonites purse.)JessieDon't say Goodbye without saying hello.Meowtha post card?---------------------------------------------Scene change. We see Mewtwo waving his hand back and forth moving the clouds, causing a big storm to start. We then see mew sleeping in a bubble underwater as the bubble floats to the top and pops, Mew wakes up and flies off. Ash and everyone run out of the storm and into a ocean side house that has all the other trainers who were invited.---------------------------------------------A TrainerCalm down Kingler! Cut it out!	(Our heroes run inside wet.)AshIt was a beautiful day!BrockThe weather along this beach can change easily.	(we notice a big crowd of trainers by the door and Officer Jenny standing with a woman talking to them all)CrowdHuh? The ferry has been canceled?SweetWe can't go to the New Island?!CrowdOh No! We were invited to go!Officer JennyBe quiet everyone. Here is the Pier Master.BoijerI'm Boijer. If you want to know about the sea ask the seagulls on the pier. No need to bother. Just look at the flaw of the clouds. I've never seen such a hurricane in all my years.Officer JennyIs it that terrible?BoijerI grew up on a port and I've never experienced such a storm. Besides the storm is above New Island offshore of this pier. I can't let you be placed in danger. That's my wish as the one who guards this pier.Officer JennyAs you heard the ferry has been cancelled.UmioIts okay with my pokÈmon. My pokÈmon are stronger in water. I can cross the sea.BoijerWait. I'm the one who knows the sea and I say no!Officer JennyShe's right! Besides if the pokÈmon were to get hurt now they wouldn't be able to get treatment at a PokÈmon Center.AshWhat do you mean?Officer JennyNurse Joy at the PokÈmon Center is missing. PokÈmon can't receive treatment without Nurse Joy. The poster over there is the missing person report	(Brock looks at it)BrockBeautiful... Who? I've seen her somewhere before...	(Some of the trainers go outside in the storm wanting to cross the ocean. Soroa gets onto his Pidgeot and flies off. Umio gets on his Gyarados and swims across.)Officer JennyStop! Stop or I'll arrest you!	(Sweet gets on her Dewgong and starts swimming away.)BoijerThere's no use trying to stop them. After all they're pokÈmon trainers. If they were children who would stop after being told to, they wouldn't have gathered here. Let's just pray for there safety.	(Ash, Brock, Misty and Pikachu run outside and see everyone leaving.)AshAcross the sea lives the strongest trainer in the world. I can't cop out now.MistyBut we can't cross this sea using our pokÈmon.AshRight.	(A Small wooden ship pulls up with 2 people in it. Guess who?)JessieWant a ride? Not saying that it's free but depending on the situation. I might allow you onboard. 	(They get on and start going and Meowth is dressed like a girl in front of the boat, then a huge wave and Team Rocket's costumes fall off. then the waves start getting really rough.)AshYou guys! You guys again?!BrockYou guys appear at the very worst times!AshWhat do you want?JessieIf we're asked what we want...JamesThe answer to that is..MeowthThere's no time for saying that!	(A huge wave flips the boat. Misty shoots out Staryu and swims to the surface.)BrockAsh! Misty!	(Misty comes up and he grabs onto Staryu.)MistyWhere is Ash and Pikachu?!(A big wave comes again, and they go back under and see As h swimming up with Squirtle.)  AshHold on tight everyone!	(Squirtle and Staryu keep swimming under the waves until they see light. Then it shows Mew flying above the clouds. Ash and everyone get to the castle and climb out of the water, and the mysterious lady is standing there.LadyWelcome to the New Island. Please show me your invitation.AshHow's this?	(He shows her).B rockThat was you just as I thought!LadyYes?BrockThat picture of Nurse Joy I saw in the missing person report at the pier was you.MistyThat reminds me, she looks like her.LadyI don't know what your talking about. I've been serving this castle ever since I was born. Come this way. The other guests are already waiting.---------------------------------------------They go inside and Team Rocket floats up from the water on top of Weezing. Then it shows Mew playing with the windmill on top of the castle. MEANWHILE Ash and everyone are inside the castle.---------------------------------------------LadyThose are the trainers who have already arrived.AshOnly 3?LadyThe trainers who couldn't cross that storm aren't worth inviting.BrockSo then you tested us?LadyPlease take out the pokÈmon from the pokÈballs and be seated. You are the chosen trainers.James	(outside and the front door shuts)Well then, let's sneak into this castle...JessieThe only way is to use the exit.MeowthWhere's the exit?JessieOver there...MeowthThe s..s..sewer!? I'm not a brown rat!JessieDon't complain!	(All of a sudden Mew comes down from behind TR and looks at them. Jessie turns her head but Mew disappeared.)JamesWhat's wrong Jessie?JessieNothing lets go.---------------------------------------------Meanwhile...---------------------------------------------SoraoYou came too?AshYou?SoraoI flew here. My Pidgeot can cross such a hurricane in one flight. Everyone greet them! 	(all his pokÈmon say their names Then they see a Gyarados.)UmioThat's my Gyarados. I rode him across the sea. Those kind of waves are nothing for it. AshGyarados is a brutal pokÈmon isn't it?UmioYeah, but if you can handle it, no one is more reliable.SweetMy pokÈmon are just the same over there. 	(points to her Blastoise, Wigglytuff, and more. Then all the lights turn off, there is a bright beam of light coming down the center of a huge spiral staircase.)LadyThat you for waiting everyone. The strongest pokÈmon trainer is coming. 	(All of a sudden Mewtwo starts floating down and all the pokÈmon get worried.)LadyYes, this is the strongest pokÈmon trainer and strongest pokÈmon. Mr. Mewtwo.	(The lights come back on and everyone can see him clearly.)AshMewtwo?UmioA PokÈmon is a pokÈmon trainer? It can't be. 	(It becomes apparent that MewTwo is telepathically controlling Joy...)MewtwoI've decided my own rules.MistyThat voice!BrockTelepathy!	(Mewtwo raises Umio up in the air and throws him into a pool 	(using his mind)UmioDarn it! Go Gyarados!	(Gyarados attacks with Hyper Beam, it goes to Mewtwo and Mewtwo stops it and turns it around and it hits Gyarados causing it to faint.)MewtwoThat was easy. 	(looks at Joy)I no longer have any need for you anymore.	(Joy faints into Brock's arms)BrockNurse Joy.Nurse JoyWhere is this place? Why am I here?MewtwoTo make you take care of me, I took you from the PokÈmon Center. A doctor who is familiar with pokÈmon is convenient. You were quite useful. You don't remember anything though.BrockWhat did you say?MewtwoHumans can be manipulated in any way with my power.MistyWith what power?PikachuPIKA!	(Meanwhile TR are in the castle and they find a strange room and they enter it.)MeowthWhat is this place? 	(They look and see a Charizard, Venusaur and a Blastoise in Big Glass Test Tubes sleeping.)MeowthCute!JamesIs it really?JessieThese aren't like any treasures I've seen.	(Jessie walks away and sits on some button and a computer turns on with a very fuzzy screen.)Computer...our study... to continue in our research ... we would have to collect samples from our test subjects...	(All of a sudden something grabs Meowth and throws him in a machine)MeowthHELP! HELP!JessieMeowth!	(Both Jessie and James start pull to get Meowth out and they do get him out but not before the machine got 3 hairs from off of his tail.)MeowthOUCH! My hair!	(on the computer screen a figure of a Meowth shows up and the computer starts saying some weird stuff then in an empty test tube next to Team Rocket, a Meowth falls down from a pipe into it)All of TRMEOWTH?!MeowthI am Meowth.JamesThen this is.... Meowth's copy? 	(Mew appears behind Team Rocket again.)ComputerBut the copy we created is more than we've imaged. The pokÈmon which we found.... in the depths... it's name is Mew... We succeeded in finding fossilized eye lashes of a mew. From the gathered components we created Mewtwo with this machine. The goal was to make the strongest pokÈmon with our own hands. That was our dream. But soon Mewtwo displayed unmeasurable violence. Its all over. The research office will be destroyed. The only way left to abandon this place and escape. 	(the computer shuts off)JessieThis is the research office?JamesI think so.MeowthYeahJamesBut there's nothing wrong with it.JessieOr maybe something created it again.JamesBut who?MewtwoI thought of working with humans once. But I was disappointed. Humans are the worst creatures inferior to pokÈmon. If creatures that are weak and cruel like humans control this world, this planet will come to ruin. BrockAre you saying like your gonna rule it?Mewtwo	(shakes his head)PokÈmon are no good either because this planet is ruled by humans our pokÈmon... pokÈmon who lived for humans.PikachuPika..pika pika!MewtwoWhat did you say? You're not being controlled? You're with the humans because you want to be? To be with them by itself is wrong.	(Mewtwo lifts Pikachu up with his mind and throws him but Ash jumps back and catches him!)Pikachupika!AshPikachu!MewtwoWeak pokÈmon rely on humans.MistyAsh! Are you ok?AshYeah. How dare you attack Pikachu?!SoroaWe can get him no matter what kind of pokÈmon he is, as long as he's a pokÈmon, GO RYHORN!	(Ryhorn charges at Mewtwo and is 1 inch from him and Mewtwo stops him and raises him into the air, and shoots Ryhorn across the room!) SoroaRyhorn!MewtwoIt's no use. I was born as the strongest of any pokÈmon in the world.AshYou don't know that before we try.MewtwoYou wan to try?AshWe can ask for nothing better.--------------------------------------------------------Mewtwo eyes start glowing then it shows in the lab with Team Rocket in it Charizard, Venusaur, and Blastoise come out of there test tubes and walk out the door. then Mew flies out with them.--------------------------------------------------------JamesWas that a..?JessieMew?MewtwoAny human who are aiming to be pokÈmon trainers go first. Charizard, Blastoise, Venusaur.	(The 3 copies raise up from the ground.)These are the evolved forms of the copies I've made. SweetCopies?SoroaThey are...?	(Everything starts shaking and a huge door opens and inside is a pokÈmon battle field.)BrockA battle field? Is he going to have a pokÈmon battle?SoroaI've got Venusaur for that copy one!SweetI've got Blastoise for that copy one!AshI've got Charizard too. Charizard I chose you!	(Charizard comes out and gives Mewtwo and evil look then shoots fire out at him but Mewtwo makes a force field around him so it doesn't even touch him.)Charizard, that's a surprise attack. 	(Mewtwo shoots up water and the fire goes out.)MewtwoWhat a bad tempered Charizard. So who's first?	(Soroa's Venusaur walks out.)SoroaI was careless before, but it won't go that way this time.	(The copied Venusaur walks out.)SoroaVenusaur! Razorleaf!MewtwoVine Whip.	(Copied Venusaur's vines chop up the razor leafs then his vines wrap around Venusaur and tosses him across the room!)SoroaVenusaur!SweetI'm next! Go Blastoise!	(Mewtwo points for copied Blastoise to go.)SweetBlastoise, Hydro Pump!	(Copied Blastoise spins right threw the water and hits Blastoise causes him to go crashing hard into the wall.)SweetBlastoise! MistyBe careful Ash! His skills are strong!AshI know.	(Mewtwo signals Copied Charizard to go.)AshCharizard! Lets fight with speed not power! Okay go!	(Both Charizard fly up. Ashes Charizard keeps using Flame-thrower but copied Charizard dodges them all and keeps hitting Charizard in the stomach.)MistyWhere are the speed attacks?BrockThe enemy is to fast!	(Copied Charizard grabs Charizard and starts flying down to the ground!)AshCharizard!MewtwoDive Bomb Slam!Charizard hits into the ground then gets up.. roars loudly.. then faints.Ash	(Runs out to Charizard)Hold on Charizard! Are you okay?MewtwoBoth speed and power are lacking.	(Mewtwo then throws his hands up and 3 black pokÈballs appear he shoots them all out and captures Sweet's Blastoise another gets Soroa's Venusaur and the other captures ashes Charizard! A small gold statue lifts up and the 3 balls shoot down into the hole.)AshSTOP!MistyAre you taking the other's pokÈmon?!MewtwoTaking them? No. I'm going to make stronger copies than the pokÈmon you are so proud of.	(Mewtwo raises his arms again and hundreds of Black pokÈballs appear!)It's suitable enough for me.BrockCopies?AshStop! That's a violation of the rules!MewtwoDon't tell me what to do. 	(Mewtwo looks at Ash and throws him into Brock)I've decided my own rules.	(Mewtwo drops his arms and all the black pokÈballs start flying everywhere)BrockThey're Coming!AshRun everyone!--------------------------------------------------------The pokÈballs are everywhere catching the trainers pokÈmon, the Gyarados was caught then the Golduck, then Seaking, then Scyther, then Hitmonlee, then Sandslash the trainers are trying to protect there pokÈmon but there is nothing they can do! then Dewgong was caught, then Rapidash, then Vileplume. Then Bulbasaur and Squirtle are fighting them off, then Wigglytuff was caught, then Pidgeot and when they get caught the pokÈballs fly back into the whole under the statue lifted up in the air.--------------------------------------------------------AshI've got it! Take your own pokÈmon back to your own pokÈballs! Return Squirtle and Bulbasaur! 	(they both go back into their pokÈballs)  MewtwoIt's no use.	(2 black pokÈballs go to Ash, open, and capture the pokÈballs Bulbasaur and Squirtle are in!)Nothing is impossible with the black pokÈballs I have made. 	(Misty puts Togepy in her bag and shuts it tight while Brock holds Vulpix close.)Nurse JoyThis place is no good. Let's run outside!	(Nurse Joy, Psyduck, Misty and Brock start running but then a black ball catches Psyduck)MistyMy Psyduck!	(A black ball catches Vulpix.)BrockVulpix!	(Pikachu is being hunted down by tons of black pokÈballs! Then Pikachu falls and is about to be caught! But Ash jumps in front of him and the pokÈballs hit him.)AshRun Pikachu! 	(Pikachu is running and starts climbing the spiral stairs with ash running after him. Pikachu keeps using Thundershock to blow up all the pokÈballs around him but more keep coming! Ash starts running up the stairs a little behind Pikachu)Don't give up Pikachu! 	(Pikachu gets tired and he accidentally falls of the stairs! Ash jumps after him and is about to grab him but then a black pokÈballs snatches Pikachu! But Ash catches the pokÈball and then falls into some water but when he does the pokÈballs slips out of his hands and goes into the hole. Since it was the last pokÈmon the statue starts to drop but Ash just barely makes it and jumps down into the hole after the Pikachu in the ball! Team Rocket is still in the Lab, which is where all the copies are going. They are amazed at all the copies dropping into all the test tubes everywhere but then Ash falls down chasing after Pikachu!)JessieBrat?AshI'm sorry, I don't have time to deal with you today!	(Ash jumps and grabs Pikachu's pokÈball but right when he does about 25 little metal mini hand like things come down trying to keep Pikachu, Ash is fighting off the mini hands.)Let it go! Darn it! Let him go! Let go of my Pikachu! Let go! 	(All the hands break and the whole copy machine starts blowing up and Pikachu comes out of his ball.)Pikachu!PikachuPika!But then all the Copy pokÈmon start coming out of there tubes because the whole copy machine is all blown up. All the copies start walking out of the room.JessieOh no! There coming out!MeowthMy copy to!AshThose are all copies?JessieWhere are they all going?All of a sudden there's an explosion and all the black pokÈballs come out and all the original pokÈmon come out!JamesThe real ones have come out to!2 of the black balls open and 2 normal pokÈballs come out, then those open and Squirtle and Bulbasaur come out! Ash and Pikachu runs over and starts laughing and hugging each other then ash stops and looks up and looks angry!Meanwhile up stairs...MewtwoHumans, I won't take your lives too. Leave here.The doors open to the exit.MewtwoThat is if you an make it out in that storm.Then there is an explosion and all the copied pokÈmon come walking out.MewtwoWhat happened here?From the smoke, Ash and all the original pokÈmon come walking out.AshI can not forgive...! I will not forgive you!Misty/BrockAsh!Misty	(sees Psyduck)Psyduck!Brock	(sees Vulpix)Vulpix!MewtwoDid you set them free?AshI will protect my pokÈmon, my friends.	(Ash charges at Mewtwo and goes to punch him but Mewtwo throws him down to the ground. Ash gets up and tries again and Mewtwo lifts him up.)MistyAsh!BrockStop!	(Mewtwo throws Ash into a huge statue but just as he's about to hit it -which we know would really hurta pink bubble stops him and Ash bounces a few times on that.)MewtwoWhat?	(Mew flies up to Ash and stares at him, Ash then looks at Mew and Mew pops the bubble and Ash falls -only like a foot then Mew starts giggling.)You're... 	(Mew makes another bubble and starts jumping up and own on it giggling and having a good time, then Mewtwo makes a black electric ball and shoots it up and it pops mew bubble. Mew turns around and looks at Mewtwo confused. Mewtwo makes another and blows up when it hits Mew. Mewtwo makes 3 more and throws them all up at Mew, Mew dodges them all and starts giggling again.)BrockThat's...MistyPokÈmon?Mew flies down and looks at MewtwoMewtwoMew. The pokÈmon that's supposed to be the rarest pokÈmon in the world.BrockMew? 	(Mew looks around at everyone... I love this guy!)MewtwoI was made from you. But I am the stronger one...I am the true one.	(Mew is still looking around acting like its paying no attention to Mewtwo.)BrockMew and Mewtwo.SweetMewtwo was made from Mew.Mewtwo	(starts glowing)I am the only one who will survive. 	(Mewtwo starts chasing mew everywhere shooting tons of those black electric balls at him. But Mew keeps running away dodging everything.)MewtwoWho don't you want to fight? The reason why you avoid fighting is because your afraid of me? 	(Mewtwo makes another black electric ball and shoots it at Mew and knocks Mew right in the face and mew goes flying in the distance. Everyone is then shocked, but then the same type of ball only blue comes back and hits Mewtwo and he goes into a wall. Mew flies back down. and Mewtwo floats up from the fire and rubble. TR Enters the room.)MewtwoYour attacks are ineffective against me. Now is the time to decide which one of us is the true one, you the copy... which is the stronger? We were made stronger than the real ones.Mewmew, mew..mew mew mew...mew, mew..mew mew mewMeowthI see.JessieWhat is it saying?MeowthThe real one is real. If they fight only using bodies without skills. The true ones will not be beaten by their copiesMewtwoThe real one is real?.... Fine! 	(Mewtwo shoots another black electric ball at Mew but Mew dodges it and just barely misses Ash! Ash then starts climbing down the statue.)Lets decide which is the real one without skills. You're the stronger ones, GO! 	(All the copies start attacking their originals. The copies are winning. Mewtwo makes a visible blue force field around himself. Mew does the same except its pink and they fly up high in the air and keep ramming into each other. Then Pikachu is looking around at the big copy war then he sees his copy standing there ready to fight him! Pikachu can't believe it.)Nurse JoyWhat is this fighting? Both the real ones and copies are alive now.SweetEveryone is a living thingBrockThough they were created, there are living beings that live in this world.MistyThe real ones and the copies... But both of them are the same living things. There's no such thing as a win and losing.JamesIf we were asked that, I wouldn't know what to sayJessieI feel so sorryJamesThey're bullying themselves.JessieIts like seeing what we used to be.JamesIts like seeing what we are now.BothFeels Bad! 	(Meowth's copy walks up to Meowth.)MeowthIts you! 	(they take out there claws and are ready fight)This is gonna hurt. But every pokÈmon is fighting each other, you're unfair.Copy MeowthMeow meow...MeowthWhat? I'm more unfair? It's because I'm not fighting with you? Your nails would hurt more wouldn't they?Copy Meowthmeow meow meowMeowthYou said tonight's moon would be round? You're right, it must be a full moon.Copy Meowthmeow meowMeowthTalking about the moon at a time like this is tasteful. Its philosophical.	(Meanwhile Mew and Mewtwo are still bouncing around fighting. And Ash finally makes it back to the ground.)Ash	(looks at everyone fighting and getting so tired)That's Enough! Stop!BrockAsh!AshI've got to stop them.BrockNo. The battle will continue unless Mew and Mewtwo stop fighting.Nurse JoyAnimals don't hand over there territory to the same type of animal.Mistyoh no.Nurse JoyThey will fight until they drive their opponents away. That is the way of living beings.BrockThat may be for living beings but Mewtwo was made by humans.MistyBut now he's a living being. AshNow they are all living beings. Mew and Mewtwo, Pikachu and that other Pikachu. 	(Mew and Mewtwo's fight finally goes on ground and they both take off there force field. Mew and Mewtwo both shoots a beam out at each other and starts to run between them not seeing the 2 beams coming!)Stop!BrockAsh! 	(Both beams hit Ash and he falls to the ground and turns to stone.)MewtwoIt can't be. A human tried to stop our fight. 	(Pikachu runs out to Ash and starts shaking Ash. Then he thunder shocks him many times and Ash still doesn't move. Pikachu begins to cry. Then all the other pokÈmon look at Pikachu -including the copiesand they start crying. All there tears float over and land on ash then last, Pikachu's tears fall onto Ash and Ash regains his hold on life, and turns back to flesh from rock)AshPikachu!PikachuPika pi!!MewtwoActually, both you and I are pokÈmon that already exist.Mewmew.MewtwoIt might be better if no one knows about us, or any of this...Mewmew...	(Mew and Mewtwo start flying away and then all the copies pokÈmon lift up into the air and fly with them!)AshWhy are you going everyone?Mewtwo	(flying away with all the copies)We were born and alive. We will continue to live somewhere in this world. 	(All of a sudden the whole castle fills up with bright light and everyone disappears......... Now we are back where all the trainers what to go on the ferry.)Officer JennyThe ferry has been canceled! There's a hurricane coming!Nurse Joy	(walks through the crowd)Don't worry everyone. I'm going to open the PokÈmon Center as a shelter. Follow me those who need it.BrockNurse Joy, the officer, and Ms. Boijer. Even more beautiful than usual when they are wet by the rain.AshBut why are we here?MistyI don't know. We're here because we're here.AshIt doesn't matter. Well... Huh? 	(Everyone runs outside)It can't be...Officer JennyThe hurricane... it's as if it never existed.BoijerI can run the ferry for again tomorrow.Ash	(looks up and sees a mew in the sky)Look.MistyWhat? I can't see anything.BrockBesides the clouds.AshOn the day I left to become a pokÈmon trainer, I saw a phantom pokÈmon... and now.. I've seen it again.BrockPhantom PokÈmon.AshYes, someday I will 	(Meanwhile, TR is still on the New Island except now the castle is gone.)JessieWell if its this empty...JamesClean and clear...MeowthAnd different than it usually is.
