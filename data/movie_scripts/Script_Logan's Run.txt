CAMERA moves into the clouds andjust as they blank out the SCREEN, a distant shimmer of lightbecomes visible. Moving toward it, the shimmer becomes2 EXT. - DOME OF GLASS - NIGHTA glowing but not transparent structure stretching off into theclouds that press it. CAMERA continues to move in until thedetailed structural webbing of the dome fills the SCREEN and thenCAMERA MOVES THROUGH IT and we see3 EXT. - THE CITY - DAY Shining below the dome (which we now see as a series of dome-likestructures standing off without end) -a marvelous crystalline cityof great openness, building clusters, green plazas, fountains...multi-leveled but human scale, crisscrossed by the flickering cleartubes of the MAZE- CARS.4 CLOSER ANGLE - ROOFTOPSAs a MAZE-CAR slides softly to a stop.5 ROOFTOP - THE RUNNER The hatch opens and a MAN in a hurry leaves the maze-car and runsswiftly along the rooftop and disappears into an open elevatorwhich instantly starts to descend. 6 INT - RESIDENCE PLAZA - THE ELEVATOR From a busy courtyard below we watch the elevator slide down from agreat height. As it reaches the courtyard the RUNNER darts out,pushes into the crowd.7 OUT8 WITH THE RUNNERAs he reappears around a corner, skirts a brimming pool and makesfor a kind of broad corridor which seems to lead out of thecourtyard. He is moving even faster now, glancing back as if hefears pursuit.9 ANOTHER ANGLE - CORRIDOR Above, at the railing of an oval light well, dressed in black andsilver, a figure holding an odd looking weapon lazily in one hand-- and watching. It is FRANCIS.10 WITH THE RUNNER Moving rapidly down the corridor, he suddenly stops as if feelingthe presence above. He looks up, sees the SANDMAN and his facebreaks in terror. He wheels, frantic, screaming, runs back into thehall.11 THE SANDMAN (FRANCIS) Vaulting the rail, dropping lightly to ground level, weapon poised.12 P.O.V. The crowd melting, parting to reveal the Runner backed against thepool. People are YELLING, shaking their fists, terribly excited andfearful.13 THE SANDMAN Emotionless. Aims. Fires.14 THE RUNNER - CLOSE Seeming to burst aflame in the LENS, then slipping BELOW FRAME toreveal Francis sauntering forward, holstering his weapon. The crowdclosing in behind him, applauding, congratulating him.15 THE SANDMAN Arriving at the pool where the body lies, half immersed. He leansover, lifts the right hand from the water, revealing a palm with ablack flowercrystal shape in it. He lets the hand fall back now asthe crowd CHEERS and APPLAUDS him.16 EXTREME CLOSE UP - HAND - IN THE WATER - (INSERT) Closing in until the crystal fills the SCREEN.MATCH DISSOLVE TO:(TITLES END)17 CLOSE UP - CRYSTAL - (INSERT) Clear, sparkling, flower-like. CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal18 INT. - NURSERY CORRIDOR The crystal is in the hand of a sleeping INFANT who is behind glassin one of many cubicles. Standing outside, looking in, LOGAN, dimlylit in the soft glow of the cubicle where the sleeping infantlies, swaddled and coccooned in the rosy auto-tender which catersto the baby's every need. Faint MUSIC bubbles like distantlaughter.19 OUT19X1 LOGAN Logan is twenty-five, strong, virile (yet sensitive) with a kind ofaustere grace.He is somewhat manic...proud...as he peers through the nurserywindow into a kind of foam cocoon which cradles THREE SLEEPINGINFANTS. Logan is KNOCKING on the soundless glass. LOGAN Wake up...come on, Logan-6.19X2 FRANCISentering . FRANCIS (shaking his head in mild, mocking disbelief) You are here. I couldn't believe it when they told me. What are you doing? LOGAN (still knocking on the soundless glass) Turn this way. (as one of the infants stirs, smiles, bubbles) No, no...not you...YOU! Francis tries to pull Logan away from the window, but Logan isintent on waking one of the infants. FRANCIS You should've seen me take my last Runner...perfect. (Logan continues to pound the soundless glass) I backed him up against a residence pool and when he terminated...his hand... (breaks off as Logan is paying no attention) So now you've seen him...what's the difference awake or asleep? LOGAN (to infant) Open your eyes once, idiot. (to Francis) It's not every day that a Sandman son is born. I'm telling you, Francis - that's him! FRANCIS Maybe, maybe not. What's the difference? Come on, Logan, let's get out of here before everybody finds out.But Logan isn't moving. Francis gets an idea. FRANCIS Okay...you really want to wake him up?Francis starts to pry at the Panel...knowing it will sound anALARM. LOGAN Hey, cut that out !Too late: There is a SOUND OF ALARM CHIMES. The area in which theystand is bathed in a violet glow. Logan grabs Francis firmly andstops him from prying at the panel: LOGAN Now you've done it...The CHIMES STOP...but the glow continues, a metallic VOICE is heard: VOICE Break-in scanners report intrusion, identify. LOGAN Logan-5...Francis-7, authorized duty quadrant. Intrusion accidental. VOICE Clear Logan-5 and Francis-7.The violet light goes off. FRANCIS (with affection: to Logan) Had enough? LOGAN (looking at the infant) Even the alarm didn't wake him.As Francis starts out: LOGAN (one last look; joining Francis) All right, Francis...I'm with you.They move off down the corridor...the lights behind them DIMMING asthey pass cubicles suffused with soft pink light, CHILDRENautomatically tended.CHIMES...soft. A lullaby and a soothing impersonal VOICE. VOICE Sleep time...go to sleep. Sleeping time, little ones.As they exit Nursery...Logan stops and takes one final lookbackward. FRANCIS You need a lift. Let's go to Arcade and celebrate... (teasing tone) your alert successor...Logan-6. LOGAN Has anyone ever broken in to where the babies are? FRANCIS (putting a card key into a door which opens soundlessly) Not in my time...They move through the door which closes.20 EXT. - MAZE STATION - NIGHTThey are now on a kind of enclosed platform with widely spaceddoorways, each glowing faintly. They pause, waiting. FRANCIS (peering at Logan curiously) Why? LOGAN just wondered...what happens? FRANCIS (shrugs) Dunno...flameout maybe. Whatever happens, you can bet it's final. But who would want to find out?One of the doorways brightens and the word ARCADE _ appears on it.The two men move to the spot as a maze-car stops. They enter itthrough the doorway which dims behind them as the maze-car WHOOSHESsoftly off into a kind of twilight.21 INT. - MAZE-CAR - LOGAN AND FRANCISThe door slides shut. They sink into seat forms which yield to them.They move off. 22 EXT. - MAZE- CARMoving through the city at terrific speed. Giving us glimpses of thecity as it goes. slowing finally as we see:23 THE CITY - FEATURING ARCADEBrightly lit, garish. We get only a glimpse as the maze-cardisappears into a tunnel.24 MAZE-CAR STATION - ARCADEAs the maze-car stops, opens and Logan and Francis exit into agathering CROWD.25 FULL SHOT - ARCADEGlittering, crowded. Throngs of people moving on many levels, somewalking, some on moving platforms. It's The Great White Way, LunaPark -- you name it. Gaudy booths and entrances, featuring everydelight -- too much to take in at a glance.26 WITH LOGAN AND FRANCISAs they thread their way through a crowd which admires them when itnotices them, across halls and up moving platforms, the good-naturedargument continuing... LOGAN but you don't know, you Just say what everyone says. One for one. One for one." FRANCIS Well, why no!? That's exactly how everything works. How else could the city stay in balance -You have a better idea? LOGAN (laughs) No, but at least I wonder sometimes -- instead of doing that "one for one" song of yours. You sound like a sleepteacher With a stuck tape. FRANCIS Well the minute you get a better idea you can stop wondering. (beat) You know, Logan -- you wonder a lot. Too much for a SandmanThey are passing the facade of a Relive Shop The signs urging peopleto: RELIVE YOUR MOST PRECIOUS MEMORIES. DO IT AGAIN AND AGAIN!REFRESH AND RENEW ANYTIME!! As they cross the entrance, two men come out, grinning broadly,falling into step just ahead of Logan and Francis. Then one of themen stops abruptly, almost colliding with them. He mumbles anapology and starts back to RELIVE.As he disappears into the RELIVE SHOP, his friend shrugs cheerfullyto Logan and Francis and moves on.27 ARCADE - ANOTHER ANGLE - NEW YOUThey are moving past a shop called NEW YOU #483 when a man comescannonading out, thrilled and excited. He rushes over to a prettyyoung woman who has been eying Logan and Francis, plants himself infront of her with his hands framing his face. MAN Well? How do you like it? WOMAN (critically) I don't know. The cheeks maybe... look a little - MAN Cheeks? Cheeks? Right. Too much, you think? WOMAN Too little. MAN Too little? (gestures) Too little. Okay, wait for me.And he darts back into NEW YOU #483. The woman shrugs, glancesaround, smiles and goes off with a passer-by.28 ARCADE - ANOTHER ANGLE - LOVE SHOPSigns promising LOVE, FULFILLMENT, RARE DELIGHTS. People streamingin and out. A woman comes out looking glazed, breathing"yes...yes..." As she passes CAMERA Logan and Francis emerge fromthe crowd and CAMERA moves with them. LOGAN Did you ever see Francis-8? FRANCIS (shaking his head) I never even visited Nursery before tonight. (beat) When you wonder, it slows you up -- you know?They are now passing the facade of HALLUCIMILL where the signspromise: LIFT OFF, CRAZY LIFT, SUPER LIFT...here the people goingin are simply excited but the ones coming out are clearly stonedout of their minds... FRANCIS I don't know what makes you so curious. You have any idea who his seed-mother was? LOGAN (quickly) Of course not! I m curious, not sick. (laughs)The crowd is growing denser, funneling into a kind of passageway.Logan and Francis are swallowed up in the group.29 FULL SHOT - ARCADE GREAT HALLAn immense room into which the streams of people coming from theentertainment area are mingling. There is a general air ofanticipation stirring the crowd as CAMERA singles out Logan andFrancis entering, waving to friends. CAMERA closes in on them justas they reach a beautiful woman who is obviously pleased to seeFrancis. They embrace, and as they break: FRANCIS and that's my friend, Logan. (as she acknowledges the introduction) We're celebrating his next in line. Carousel - Arcade - who knows? Want to come along? WOMAN (smiles, shakes her head) Only if I make it to the top of Carousel. (she holds up her hand) Thirty -- and the big spin.In her palm the crystal blinks, red, black. Francis nods, gives hera half-squeeze. FRANCIS You're thirty -- already? I always thought I was older than you - (beat) Well, give it a good try. WOMAN (pleasantly) You know I always have.Another beautiful WOMAN joins them. 2ND WOMAN (to the first) Sorry I won't be at Carousel tonight. It¹s my Love-Shop turn. WOMAN That's all right. Happy turn. 2ND WOMAN You'll renew. I've got a feeling. WOMAN (smiles) So do I...but if I don't at least I'll have the ultimate thrill. I'd almost rather have that than renew. 2ND WOMAN I feel the same way. Sometimes I think I'm not even going to try and renew when my time comes. But -- that's three years away. So long.The 2nd Woman walks away. FRANCIS (after a beat; to first Woman) It's been nice. WOMAN Um-huh.They look briefly and then she turns away. Francis takes Logan's armand they move off. FRANCIS I guess you never had her?Logan shakes his head. FRANCIS You missed something special. LOGAN Well...you can't have them all. LOGAN AND FRANCIS (together, it's an old joke) But you can try.They laugh, but the laughter is broken as a trio of youngsters,moving with erratic speed of lightning, smashes between them,almost knocking Francis over. He reels, Logan catches him and theyrecover in time to see the trio rip wildly through the crowd,knocking people down, screaming with shrill joy as they disappear. FRANCIS The damned Yellows are getting out of hand. Those three ought to be in Cathedral. No business scrambling in Arcade... LOGAN (laughs cuffs Francis' arm) What an old, old man you're getting to be, Francis. Weren't you ever a Yellow? I bet you were even wilder than - (he breaks off as the lights in the Great Hall dim) -- come on, Sandman.The two of them start to move to the far end of the Great Hall. 30 FULL SHOT - GREAT HALLAs everyone begins to move to the far end, where great curtainshave parted to reveal31 ARCADE GREAT HALL - CAROUSEL ENTRANCEAC the far end of the hall, where the throng is a huge crystaldesign ornaments an entrance The crystal is red and pulsingrhythmically to the accompaniment of a deep and thrilling TONE. Aswe move toward it with Logan and Francis, the TONE deepens, thegreat pulse takes on a hypnotic quality...32 WITH LOGAN AND FRANCISIn the crowd they overtake a fellow Sandman, DANIEL, and fall instep with him. When they speak now, their voices are hushed. LOGAN You should have been with us in Nursery, Daniel. I'm positive I recognized him - FRANCIS (hustling Logan) Come on. I don't want to miss the filing-in. There'll be some I know tonight, I think... DANIEL (glances at his own red crystal, nods) Yes. Me, too. You know we're both on Monitor tonight. FRANCIS Damn! That's right. Just when I feel like an ALL OUT BLAST in Arcade . LOGAN Want me to take your shift? I'm feeling restless anyway Francis glances at him, exchanges a look with Daniel. They vanishinto the throng passing under the great crystal, turn the corner andwe see33 FULL SHOT - CAROUSELframed in a huge corridor we see a steep-sided arena dropping downto a shadowy center, which even now pulsates and flickers inchanging dimensions, but always maintaining the jewel- flowershape. There is one entrance into the center -- a kind of ramp frombelow the seats, leading directly into the mysterious bowl -- Just now the seat's are filling, and the sense of expectation buildsPeople sit and immediately crane their necks, waiting...34. ANOTHER ANGLEFeaturing Logan and Francis as they find places in the arena. Likethe others, they crane upward. As they do, Logan gestures at anumber of pretty girls who are just being seated. LOGAN Now there's a few who could have been his seed-mother. FRANCIS Only a few? You're just not trying.35-36 OUT37 PANNING THE CROWDAs the seats fill, the excitement builds. Suddenly the lights beginto dim and dim...SOUND: A kind of collective sigh, breathing in unison...38 OUT38X1 ANGLE THE TIER BELOW THE SEATSSuddenly visible, the LASTDAY GROUP. Their arms are upraised and ineach palm the crystal blinks red-black, red-black.39 THE CROWD Transfixed, gripped with a religious fervor.40 LASTDAY GROUP Hands still raised, filing slowly into the mysterious well ofCarousel.41 CROWDTense, beginning nervous APPLAUSE here and there.42 CAROUSELAs the last one enters, beginning to glow and, as it does, the bowlslowly puts out leaves like some great plant, enfolding and hidingthe people within a series of translucent petals. As the Last oneenfolds them the Light intensifies, the exterior surfaces seeming toshift as if a kind of motion was beginning inside it...43 CROWDVisible in the growing Light from Carousel -gripped with passion andexcitement, APPLAUDING, gesturing as they see44 CAROUSELMoving, bands of light seeming to spiral upward Like a containedaurora as the Carousel picks up speed.45 LOGANCaught up in it Like the rest.46 CAROUSELBeginning to blur with its own speed. Through the shifting,spiraling curtain of light we see bodies moving in a kind ofweightlessness, always struggling to move higher.Follow a shadowy form as it moves, twists through other writhingshadows -- upward, upward. Suddenly the form is spread-eagled, andin a moment it is sharply outlined against the swirling canopy andthen -- a searing flash. And it is gone. SOUND: Crowd in a frenzy -- SCREAMING.47 FULL ANGLE - THE BLEACHER CROWD - FAVORING LOGANStanding. SCREAMING their cheers as:48 FULL SHOT - UP AT CAROUSELHigh, reaching downward out of the shadows beneath the dome,fringing, intersecting rainbow bands appear, looping the swirlingupper Carousel like Saturn's rings.

LOGAN Who invited you? FRANCIS I'm in my party mood. Logan smiles . . . and the CAMERA PANS them rushing out of thebleachers.They make their way into the hall.Logan takes out the small plastic box. We can tell from his facethat he is disappointed...until a faint BEEPING SOUND emanates fromthe box.Francis watches as Logan wheels in one direction... the beepingstops. He turns in another direction... again, there is no beeping.As Logan turns in a third direction...the BEEPING commences.Logan and Francis move swiftly in that direction and the BEEPINGGROWS LOUDER...AND LOUDER...until Logan and Francis see:59-59X11 WIDE ANGLE - A MAN running.CHASE: INTER CUT between Logan and Francis following the running manin the great hall...empty.

We see the flower crystal. Black.Logan takes out his transceiver.63X3 INSERT TRANSCEIVER A man's face visible. Logan checks it against the face of the deadman. They are not the same. 63X4 ANOTHER ANGLE As Francis comes up, waits. Logan moves the transceiver to the deadman's face, rests it on his forehead.63X5 INSERT TRANSCEIVER READOUT:The words appear: IDENT. AFFIRM....NEW YOU #483 ALTERATION63X6 LOGANScowls for a moment, then shrugs. He takes out a small flat pouchand methodically strips from the body its few personal things,stuffs them into the pouch. Then his eye is caught by the man'sright hand, clenched. Logan opens it. A metal ankh on a bit ofchain. It means nothing to Logan who stuffs it into the pouch andcloses it. Now again he fiddles with the transceiver, speaks into itsoftly. LOGAN Runner terminated 0:31 (a beat) Ready for cleanup.Done with his job, he rises to face Francis. LOGAN (smiling) That was a great shot you made. FRANCIS Yes. (beat) But you look a little rusty to me -- what were you doing, wondering?Logan shrugs. He's not sure himself. Together they walk off down thehall, passing CAMERA 63X7 ANOTHER ANGLEWe see in the distance, a pair of Stickmen descending into the hall,riding through the air on their odd vehicles, passing overhead thendescending. One hovers not far away as the other comes down, hangs afew feet over the body.63X8 1ST STICKMAN AND BODY The driver makes sure he's in position, then presses a button on oneof the arms of the vehicle. There is a broad spray of vapor from thebottom which covers the corpse. 63X9 CORPSE (INSERT)It turns to crystals which sag away from the human form, as a sandsculpture erodes when it's dry.63X10 1ST STICKMAN CLOSE ON HEAP OF CRYSTALSSatisfied, he revs his machine and it rises smoothly out of theSHOT. As it leaves, the second machine moves down and into itsplace. 63X11 2ND STICKMANGlances at the crystals, maneuvers into position, presses hisbuttons. 63X12 CLOSER ANGLE - THE CRYSTALS, STICKMANSucked up into the machine as it hovers. As the floor is once againbare, the 2nd Stickman revs slightly and his machine pulls up andaway. 63X13 ANOTHER ANGLE As the Stickmen move up and out, we see the exhilarated crowdbeginning to pour out of Carousel.63X14 LOGAN AND FRANCIS - ARCADEDescending from the top level -- not much of a crowd. Francis isgesturing toward the Hallucimill. FRANCIS ...Well I think you're getting stale. You need old Lucey--Go on. Gee the whole burn--try the new psycho-lift-they tell me it turns you inside out...He shoves Logan in that direction and continues on down. FRANCIS (calling after him) I'll look for you here when I'm off--And he is gone. 63X15 LOGANwaves, smiling, then turns to the Hallucimill.63X16 POV - HALLUCIMILL EXT.Crazy, man.63X17 BACK TO LOGAN Hesitates, as a COUPLE push past him gleefully on their way. Helooks and we see: 63X18 POV - ARCADE, UPPER LEVELS The people from Carousel starting to pour in, loud, happy, ready formore fun.63X19 LOGAN Not with it. He turns and starts making his way downwards towardsthe exit.63X20 LOGAN'S APARTMENT As he enters. Idle, restless. He crosses to a sideboard--makeshimself a drink, sips, doesn't like it. Gets rid of it, makesanother. He fiddles with things, a game--sits, gets up. Now he isbeginning to feel the drink. Takes another belt, smiles. Now he goesover to a tall wall recess flanked by a console with many dials.63X21 AT THE WALL RECESS As Logan dials, blurred and smoky images appear in the recess--aslow protoplasmic eddying in many colors. He tunes it in and thefigure of a smiling young man appears--bejeweled, lustrous, willing.63X22 LOGAN AT THE CONSOLE Bored as Mastroianni turns the dial again and the young mandissolves. He dials again and now a beautiful young woman takesshape. It is Jessica. 63X23 JESSICA AND LOGANStill in the recess, she makes no gesture of interest, no smile.Around her neck, from a collar, a dangling ankh. It catches Logan'seye. He smiles, clicks another dial and she becomes real. He reachesout a hand and leads her out into the room.64 LOGAN AND JESSICAAs Jessica turns to him, Logan moves in strongly and embraces her-but, to his surprise, she resists. Logan, still holding her loosely,is amused and surprised. LOGAN What's wrong, Available? JESSICA (breaking away gently) Please . . .No.She backs away, almost apologetically. Logan follows, smiling. LOGAN Please . . . no ? (noting that she looks trapped, he understands) You mean "not here"--that's it? You're a private Available but particular, (he is moving in on her as he speaks, she retreating, which amuses him) Don't worry. There's no one here but me. And you. JESSICA No. (that stops him) Just no. LOGAN You prefer women? JESSICA No. LOGAN Well then...? JESSICA Nothing. I felt sad, I put myself on the circuit. It was a mistake. LOGAN Sad? What made you sad? JESSICA A friend of mine went on Carousel tonight. Now he's gone. LOGAN (after a beat) Yes...probably he was renewed? JESSICA (flatly) He was killed LOGAN Killed? Why do you use that word? JESSICA Isn't it right? Isn't that what you do? Kill. LOGAN I never 'killed' anybody in my life. Sandmen terminate Runners (a beat) Who brought you? JESSICA Nobody. I felt sad. .. I put myself on the circuit. LOGAN You felt sad. What's your name? JESSICA Jessica. LOGAN (matter-of-fact) You're beautiful. Let's have sex. JESSICA No. LOGAN Later. JESSICA No. LOGAN But you put yourself on the circuit! JESSICA I thought I had to do something. LOGAN And? JESSICA I changed my mind LOGAN And now? JESSICA Curious. LOGAN About what? JESSICA How a Sandman lives.Logan smiles, takes off gunbelt, etc. LOGAN Let's have sex. (as Jessica shakes her head) I thought you were curious. JESSICA Not about that. LOGAN (after a beat) I'm listening. JESSICA I'm afraid to tell you. LOGAN (smiling) I'm not armed. (a beat) Well? JESSICA Why is it wrong to run? LOGAN You shouldn't even think such things... (smiles) And you picked a strange person to say them to - JESSICA I suppose. But what if you want to live? LOGAN So? Do what everyone does. Try like hell for renewal.Logan stretches out his right hand. We see a red flower crystalembedded and centered in his right palm. It is exactly the sameshape that we have seen in black in the palm of the dead runner. LOGAN When this turns black...that's it. (laughs) If for any reason you want to be 31... you have the same chance as everyone else...Carrousel.Logan takes his gun and points it at her. LOGAN (playfully) But if you're one of the misfits... that's where I come in. JESSICA (somewhat frightened) I didn't say that I would run... I Just... LOGAN (interrupting; turning over her palm) Are you a 5 or a 6? (we see a green crystal) JESSICA Six. I go red next year. LOGAN You're years away . . . I don't know why you're thinking of these things, much less talking about them. (offering Jessica the gun) Want to try?Jessica shakes her head. Logan looks at Jessica carefully...in anadmiring sexual way...from her toes to her head...briefly noticing(in the process) chat she is wearing an identical piece of jewelrythat he has taken off the dead runner...around her neck. LOGAN What Quad do you live in? JESSICA K. LOGAN (softly) You're sure you don't want to try?Jessica nods. LOGAN It's nice to know you can nod. Jessica smiles. LOGAN It's nice co know you can do that, too. Suddenly Francis and two dishevel led young WOMEN burst in and comelaughing toward Logan and Jessica Stoned, hilarious, they crowdaround Logan one of them embracing him. In the wild hilarity,Jessica slips away and Logan, seeing her go, makes a vain effortafter her. Francis notices, laughs. Amid the noise he shouts toLogan: FRANCIS These are for me -- you've got your own. (looking after Jessica) She must have been something--? At Logan's expression he roars with laughter Francis picks up anatomizer and hurls it at the ceiling where it shatters and a greatpink cloud settles over them all.64X1 EXT. - SAND MAN H.Q.A frowning structure of dark stone and mirrored copper, fronted bybroad steps. Logan and Francis are climbing the steps as a SANDMANis coming out... His uniform is in tatters. They greet one another...then: LOGAN What happened to you? SANDMAN (embarrassed) I lost a Runner in Cathedral. LOGAN How come? SANDMAN Ran into some Cubs I couldn't manage. (as they stare) One of them cut me bad... (extends his arm and moves a finger from his shoulder to his wrist) all the way down. FRANCIS (with anger) CUBS! SANDMAN (shrug) On my way to the New You for repairs. LOGAN Get yourself a new face while you're at it They know you now.They wave. Logan and Francis continue.64AX1-64BX1 OUT 64CX1 INT. - SANDMAN H.Q. LOBBY (VOICE OVER)As Logan and Francis cross, turn into a corridor. LOGAN I just might look in on New You 483 myself. FRANCIS You? Why? You're already beautiful. LOGAN No -- it's that last Runner -- someone in 483 was trying to help him.64X2 INT. - SANDMAN H.Q. - READY ROOMAs Logan and Francis cross the room, Logan nods to other Sandmen,who are monitoring areas of the Megalopolis on video consoles. Oneof these Sand-men speaks to Francis who hasn't greeted them SANDMAN (Monitor) What's with you, Francis? FRANCIS (touching his head; grimacing) Last night The other Sandmen, including Logan, smile as Logan and Franciscontinue to:65-68 OUT69 INT. - SANDMAN H.Q. - DEBRIEFING AREABlack door opens revealing Logan and Francis who now enter a mammothroom. As they walk. . . they pass FOUR GIANT LIFECLOCKS...WHITE,YELLOW GREEN AND RED. Each LIFECLOCK pulses out the moments of every person alive in thecity, governing everyone's crystal changes automatically shifting tothe next LIFECLOCK when the time comes.There are no humans.Francis walks over to a circular table at the end of the room....above which is a circular overhang. There is a groove...the shape ofa palm crystal on one part of the circular table.Francis takes out the plastic bag which contains the contents of thedead Runner's pockets and starts putting the contents on the table.(These contents are the ones from the Runner Francis has killed atthe beginning of the film.)The moment the first item touches the table...it activates a scanneron the overhang above. Francis stands alongside the table...his attitude is very matter-offact. He has been through this procedure many, many times.He touches his head...(the hangover)...and Logan smiles. Momentslater...the scanner stops...the word: | IDENTIFYappears on a SCREEN. Francis places his palm into the groove. . .and the words: CLEAR FRANCIS-7appear on the SCREEN. FRANCIS See you in the hydrotoner! Logan nods.Francis exits as Logan places the contents of a plastic bag with theitems he has taken off the Runner who jumped to his death. Amongthem is the odd-shaped piece of jewelry.Logan is standing nonchalantly...as the scanner moves over theitems...waiting to be quickly identified and cleared as Francis wasearlier.The scanner continues scanning.Logan starts becoming impatient...but the scanning goes on and onand on.Now...Logan is clearly puzzled...it has never...ever taken anythingremotely resembling this length of time.Suddenly, directly before him...on the SCREEN... the word: PROBABILITYblinks on and off...on and off...catching Logan's attention. AsLogan turns toward the SCREEN...the scanner stops moving. The wordPROBABILITY blinks off and is replaced by the word: APPROACHWe can tell from Logan's expression as he walks to the corner. . .that he has never seen this before. Logan sits in a chair in the area facing the SCREEN. There is astellar groove (that we have seen on the Table) the shape of a palmcrystal....glowing on an arm of the chair.The word on the SCREEN is now: IDENTIFYLogan places his right palm with the flower crystal into the groove.We hear a HUMMING NOISE....then: The piece of jade Jewelry appearson the SCREEN and below the piece of jewelry the following wordsappear on the SCREEN: OBJECT OCCURS IN NONRANDOM PATTERN AND FREQUENCY.

(slightest beat) Question: My Life-- Before the startled Logan can finish...he feels a shock of pain andhis hand is immobile. Logan stares at the back of his hand as if itwasn't his. His forehead shines with sweat.Now the entire area, including the chair and the screen begins toglow bright red. The glowing becomes so bright that Logan is forcedto close his eyes.As the glow subsides...Logan looks at his right hand. The red flowercrystal in his palm is blinking. He stares at it, fascinated,fearful. LOGAN Question: (urgent tone) Am I still six Red? The words on the SCREEN read: LIFECLOCK-ALTER LOGAN (standing) I know that but I had four more years (extending the blinking palm) This means ten days to Lastday. Of course I will get the four years back, won't I?The words on the SCREEN read: TAKE OBJECT WITH YOU LOGAN (very urgent) Question: Do I get my four years back?Too late. The SCREEN is BLANK. For a moment his lips part as if tosay something more but he changes his mind, turns away.Now Logan walks over to the table and removes the ankh. Almostautomatically, he starts moving his hand toward the groove...but theSCREEN already has the words: CLEAR LOGAN-5Logan looks at it - then:The CAMERA PANS Logan out of the mammoth room.... past the GIANTLIFECLOCKS....where he pauses.... glances at his BLINKINGCRYSTAL....and continues out into:69X1 INT. - HYDROTONER - DAY Spectacularly 23rd century.

FRANCIS What the hell took you so long? LOGAN (after a beat) Did you ever see anybody renew? FRANCIS I think you've been skulling out too much. First Nursery and now stupid questions. LOGAN Did you? FRANCIS Of course. LOGAN Anybody we know? FRANCIS Look....why don't you get into the water....you need it....more than I do. LOGAN (after a beat) I'm fine.... (walking away) See you.... FRANCIS At Carousel tonight?Logan nods, exits. The CAMERA REMAINS on a slightly puzzled FRANCISfor a moment then FOLLOW Logan out to:70 EXT. - SANDMAN BUILDING Logan is on the steps, irresolute.

LOGAN (into box) Location...female Green Six... name Jessica...living in Quad K.71-73 OUT73X1 INT. - LOGAN'S APARTMENT Logan opens the door to see Jessica. Behind her a young SANDMAN whohas obviously escorted her there. YOUNG SANDMAN (smiling) She says she's been here before... LOGAN She has.Jessica half turns and shrugs a 'see?'. The young Sandman's smilewidens, he waves to Logan and shoves off. JESSICA You could have called me yourself. LOGAN But I wasn't sure you'd come. JESSICA (the game has started) Here I am. (beat) Shall I come in?Logan gestures, leading her inside to the living area. LOGAN I couldn't get you out of my mind. JESSICA I'm the most beautiful woman you've ever seen, I suppose? LOGAN Maybe...sure.... JESSICA Thanks...but I have the choice. LOGAN Of course. JESSICA Then it's still no.Logan laughs. JESSICA You can have any woman in the city. What do you really want? LOGAN You know JESSICA I don't believe you. There has to be more. LOGAN All right.Logan extends his right hand. He turns his right palm so that.Jessica can see it blinking red.Jessica gasps for a moment...then: JESSICA Why show me? LOGAN I'm going to run. JESSICA (after reacting) Why tell me? LOGAN You know something. JESSICA About running, dying what? LOGAN Both...running's what I'm interested in. JESSICA I know what everyone knows. Try like hell for Renewal. You have the same chance everyone else has. LOGAN It's different now. Help me. JESSICA How can I?Logan takes out the ankh. JESSICA Where did you get that? LOGAN A Runner gave it to me. JESSICA And then you killed him, right? LOGAN I let him go...believe me. JESSICA I don't.. LOGAN (a beat) Speak to your friends for me, Jessica... please... JESSICA Please? What friends? LOGAN (clutching the ankh, looking at Jessica's; then:) I don't have much time. JESSICA I never heard of a Sandman running . . . ever. . . LOGAN (putting the ankh in his pocket; dropping the bombshell) And I never heard of Sanctuary.Jessica reacts. She is about to speak. . .doesn't..Logan reaches out and touches her hand. LOGAN What can I do to make you believe me?Jessica draws her hand away quickly from his touch.Logan stands and starts out...as Jessica watches him..74-81 OUT 82 EXT. - A SLEEK, OUTDOOR RESTAURANT - NIGHTThere are three men and a woman seated at a table.

SECOND MAN He's blinking...so what? Sandmen get old, too. FIRST MAN But what if he's telling the truth? THIRD MAN I say no. It's not worth the risk. WOMAN I absolutely agree. He's killed Runners for a decade. He has no feelings. JESSICA He was born a Sandman. He had no choice. WOMAN Neither do we.87-88 OUT88X1 SANDMAN READY ROOM Four Sandmen at the consoles. They look up as Francis enters. He goes to one of the men who stretches, yawns, gets up. 1ST SANDMAN Thanks, Francis. FRANCIS (taking his place at the console) Just don't be forever about it like last time. 1ST SANDMAN Ah-h you love it. You're afraid you'll miss a really good Run. They all laugh. Francis takes up his watch as the other exits.89 OUT89X1 EXT - RESTAURANT - THREE MEN A WOMAN AND JESSICALeaning together talking in an undertone SECOND MAN (urgently) If he believes you, he'll come. JESSICA Why Arcade Station? SECOND MAN (impatiently) Why? It's our only chance--kill him and get away in the crowd heading for the evening slaughter -- JESSICA Right at the station itself? MAN No - just there - on the first level. (beat) Don't look for us. We'll see you. WOMAN (cutting in) You don't seem quite sure, Jessica. (beat) Can you do it? Will you?Slowly, Jessica nods. THIRD MAN Tonight? JESSICA (stalling) Y-yes...if I can find him. WOMAN I think you can. Don't you?Jessica faces her squarely, nods. The woman looks deeply into hereyes, relaxes. WOMAN I'm sorry. We all are. But he has heard about Sanctuary -- and that makes him dangerous to all of us.After murmurs of agreement: SECOND MAN (staring at Jessica) We're counting on you.Jessica exits. They look at each other in dismay.. After a moment,one of the men follows her. They don't trust her.90-92 OUT93-94 OUT94A1 READY ROOM - FRANCIS Obviously enjoying the work, watching--tracking a Runner's progress,the assignment of a Sandman, the kill. 94X1 WITH JESSICA Making her way through the strolling crowd, her face thoughtful.94X2 ANOTHER ANGLEThe man from the restaurant, following.94X3 GALLERY, SANDMAN RESIDENCE -- JESSICAWalking slowly up to a door, she hesitates, KNOCKS.Logan opens the door, reacts.

JESSICA What do you need?A moment, then Logan moves toward her hungrily, pulling her in tohim as the door closes.94X4 OUTDISSOLVE TO: 94X5 WITH LOGAN AND JESSICAWalking along a handsomely landscaped stream. Laughing together,stopping to admire the beautiful fish (koi). JESSICA What're you going to do? LOGAN That's tomorrow. JESSICA (turning away slightly) I wish I could help you. LOGAN (turning her gently back) Maybe you'll chink of something... JESSICA (hating herself) I wish I knew what you think I know. Logan smiles at her, both knowing what's false, but drawn to eachother anyhow. They commence walking again. 94X6 ANOTHER ANGLE The followers, ahead now, watching, trying to make up their minds asto whether Jessica is bringing Logan to the ambush. As they argue,Logan and Jessica approach.94X7 WITH LOGAN AND JESSICA LOGAN If you did know, you'd tell me. JESSICA Of course-- LOGAN (overriding) If you trusted me, you'd know. JESSICA (evading it) We're coming to Arcade. (beat) - Shall we Relive together? 94X8 CLOSE ANGLEAs they pass, Jessica looks full in the face of one of thefollowers, looks away. Logan does not notice. The followers arepartly reassured. One of the men is now holding a garrote made fromhis necklace. The man who first followed gestures and the others gooff purposefully. He continues after Logan and Jessica as they exitround a corner.94X9 OUT94AX9 READY ROOM As 1st Sandman returns, still cheerfully chewing. Francis isreluctant to give up his place and when he does, he remains standingthere, watching. He loves the work--they all do.94X10 ARCADE - LOWER LEVEL Logan and Jessica entering. Logan is aware of Jessica's increasingtension. He pretends unconcern, but he is wary.94X11 ANOTHER ANGLEBehind them, visible through the crowd--two of the men we sawbefore. The Follower and the man with the garrote. They are movingso as to intersect with Logan and Jessica where the crowd isthickest, streams coming together to move to a higher level.94X12 FEATURING JESSICA As they move, fearful--torn between her promise and her feeling forLogan. Catching a glimpse of the followers, she makes a small sound,hesitates, pretends to have stumbled.94X13 THE AMBUSHERS Closer now, closing in -- the wire garrote gleaming between theman's hands. 94X14 LOGAN AND JESSICA Suddenly she stops. He comes round facing as people eddy by them.Logan looks at her searchingly. LOGAN Tell me, Jessica.Behind him the two men move in. The man with the garrote raises hishands. One more step... Logan senses something, half-turns just aswe hear a familiar urgent SOUND--the sound of his transceiver.Behind him the man hesitates, drops his hands. Logan takes thetransceiver from his belt and moves out of the crowd to the side,Jessica with him. Now he bends to read the message and Jessicacranes her head to see too. 94X15 READY ROOM - FRANCIS AND SANDMENAs the Runner alarm pulses and the readout flashes its message: RUNNER FEMALE: CATHEDRAL Q-2 ...LOGAN-5The Sandman at the console turns and says: 1ST SANDMAN Hey, Logan's got a mean one tonight-- why don't you--But Francis is already at the door. A wave and he's gone. The othersad lib interest-- "watch out in there--they can cut you before yousee them" etc.95-105 OUT105X1 ARCADE STATION - THE AMBUSH The two watching, muscles taut -- wondering.106-106X1 OUT106X2 ARCADE - TWO SHOT - LOGAN AND JESSICA As he speaks he leads her into the maze-car station and punches outhis destination on the car caller. LOGAN A Runner...Cathedral. A woman.106X3 MAZE-CAR STATION ARCADE JESSICA You're not going, are you? LOGAN (a beat) Why not? Maybe she'll help me. You won't. You'd better stay here.The maze-car arrives and they move to it. JESSICA (touching his arm) I'd rather be with you. LOGAN (knowing she is lying through her teeth) That's nice. They enter the car which instantly moves off. As it passes, the menin ambush come forward and read the destination. They ring foranother car which pulls in immediately.107-109X1 OUT 109X2 ANOTHER ANGLE As the two jam into the maze-car which rockets off in pursuit...110-120 OUT121 INT - MAZE-CAR - LOGAN AND JESSICA - MOVING SHOT LOGAN Have you ever been through Cathedral?Jessica shakes her head. LOGAN They're like beasts. Wild. JESSICA Maybe they're angry because they're grown in meccano-breeders. LOGAN (interrupting, grimacing) Instead of what? Nine months inside a woman: (ugh) We're all raised the same but most of us don't become cubs in Cathedral. JESSICA Some people say children need human mothering. LOGAN Insane. Nurseries are better than any mother could be. JESSICA I'm only telling you what I've heard... (slightest beat) Haven't you ever wondered what your seed-mother was Like...? LOGAN Uh-uh. JESSICA I have. LOGAN (after a beat) When did you begin to question Lastday? JESSICA I don't remember exactly...except I was a Green. (another beat) What would you like to relive, Logan? LOGAN (smiling) Let's see - how long has it been?As Jessica turns her head...looking somewhat guilty, the maze-carslides to a stop.A warning light pulses on the car's console and a RECORDED VOICEspeaks before the hatch opens. VOICE Attention passengers. Cathedral Station is a personal risk area. Persons with business are warned to be careful.121X1 EXT. - MAZE-CAR - CATHEDRAL STATION Now the hatch opens. They step out, Logan first, Jessica timidly,looking around. Behind them the hatch closes, the maze-car sighsaway into the distance. JESSICA I've never been in this quadrant. (looks off) Is that Arcade off there? There are standing on the maze-car platform -- a high overlook likean "elevated" station. 121X2 POV - THE CITY BEYOND THE WALLS OF CATHEDRALArcade shining like distant fireworks.122 EXT. - MAZE-CAR M PLATFORM - CATHEDRALBelow them a narrow, sharply angled concrete canyon, buttressedwalls rising featureless. The look of an old fortress, blank, dimand cool. Still visible over an opening the chiseled legend"Cathedral Plaza--2025 A.D.--Skidmore, Rosenfelt, Hennesyarchitects."Jessica shivers, looking around her. Logan takes her arm and theydescend into the canyon, move toward the wall. Their footsteps theonly SOUND. LOGAN Let me go first. Sometimes they're waiting just inside there--to rush you when it opens... LOGAN Quickly now--He helps her through the narrow opening--the portal's walls are verythick.. They turn abruptly and see:123 INT. - WALL - DAZZLE CHAMBERA room of angled, reflecting surfaces. At one end a jagged corridor,also mirrored, leads away. The zigzag, angled effect creates anabsolute confusion of images. but Logan leads her unhesitatinglyacross the chamber to the corridor. Jessica hangs back, momentarilycertain she's about to smash into something. LOGAN (guiding her) Just follow--no matter how it seems... JESSICA (doing her best) But what is this--why? LOGAN (as they enter the corridor) The Cubs. When they're flying on muscle there's no way to catch up. Without the dazzle, they'd just go past us-- (gesture) too fast JESSICA Muscle? I don't know that one. Logan is leading her down the zigzag corridor. It's stop and go--afun house in which you can get hurt. LOGAN It's unauthorized. No good for any- one over thirteen anyhow--shakes you to pieces--speeds everything up to a blur-- (he is amused) you can see what happens when some flying Cub tries to go through this on muscle--splat! Jessica reacts...to what Logan has said...then: A moment later: 124 ANOTHER ANGLE As they approach the end of the corridor, a small FIGURE in atattered garment approaches them. She stops SINGING as she seesLogan and Jessica. JESSICA (gently) Don't be afraid.We see that it is a little GIRL of seven. Her face is grimy and hairis tangled. JESSICA What's your name? MARY I'm Mary 2. JESSICA Where do you live, Mary? MARY Here. JESSICA Why aren't you in Nursery? MARY I'm very smart. JESSICA When do you go up? MARY I never go upstairs. You're a nice old lady.As soon as she finishes her last sentence, Mary grabs at Jessica'sclothing...tearing a pin (piece of Jewelry) off...and running awayswiftly.As Jessica instinctively starts after her...Logan... holds her back. LOGAN (shaking his head) Not here. Might be a decoy.Cautiously, Logan and Jessica exit from the wall, stepping out into-125 EXT. - CATHEDRAL ITSELFAn area of rubble and dilapidated buildings.Logan crouches, holding the transceiver and fanning the area,listening...SOUND: a soft beeping which abruptly grows louder and holds steady.Logan gestures to Jessica to follow him, and moves carefully in thedirection of the BEEPING, quartering occasionally like a huntingdog. Coming up to an angle of wall, he stops, flicks the sound off,puts the machine back onto his belt. He gestures to Jessica to standstill then he straightens, steps out, calls: LOGAN Runner!Silence. Jessica involuntarily moves to him and as she does, theRunner moves from behind an upright and stands.- The figure isshadowed, the arms out, palms facing in a kind of gesture ofsurrender. In the Runner's left hand, the tiny red crystal pulses onand off. The Runner is a woman!There is an instant of frozen confrontation and then suddenlyJessica gasps, grasping at him. As Logan whirls: 125X1 ANOTHER ANGLE Suddenly, from everywhere out of the shadows, a pack of snarlingCubs materializes--moving with blinding speed. At their appearancethe Runner whirls and races off into the dark shadows. Logan makes afutile gesture after her, then turns to face the Cubs.A strutting, feral-faced fourteen or fifteen year old heads thepack, dressed in fierce-looking tatters and hung with rip-offtrophies. He gestures to one of his followers to stand still. BILLY (speaking of the Runner) Don't worry about her. We'll have that one later. Right now I think we've got a Runner and his pairup. And what a Runner!The CAMERA PANS the other Cubs...mean, filthy. A VOICE We're going to have ourselves a time, we are. Right, Billy?!There is a chilling laughter of agreement from the rest. LOGAN I'm a Sandman! BILLY I cut up a Sandman yesterday. They said I'd never get him...but I cut him up good, I did. LOGAN (firm tone) I feel sorry for you, boy!Some murmuring as the pack watches their leader. BILLY For me? Better feel sorry for your- self, Sandman! LOGAN No, for you! How old are you, Billy?Billy is silent. LOGAN Fourteen? Fifteen? Your days are running out. How long can you last? A year. Six months? (he points to the yellow flower in Billy's palm) What happens when you're sixteen and you go green? BILLY (lashing out) Nothing will happen! I make the rules as I go!! Cubs do what I say! Always have! Always will! I got Cathedral and I'll never let go! LOGAN No cubs over fifteen, Billy! Ever heard of a cub with a green flower? You'll leave Cathedral then, Billy, when you're on green, because they won't let a green stay here. (slightest beat) If you try to stay the young ones will gut-rip you apart! BILLY Shut up! Shut up your damn mouth!Logan falls back into a fighting crouch...but before he can strike ablow..he is grabbed and slammed against the wall of an abandonedbuilding. ANOTHER VOICE Let him suck Muscle! That'll shut his mouth! Let's watch him shake himself to death!! We see the Cubs take out drugpads. They squeeze the pads and inhalethe "Muscle." At once their movements become blurringly rapid. Theytake menacing positions - some leaping overhead. A VOICE Give him some Muscle!! Like lightning they change positions and flash around Logan andJessica 126 CLOSE ON - JESSICA Watching..terrified.127 CLOSE ON - LOGAN Being held against the wall by Cubs as: ANOTHER VOICE Shake him to death!! A VOICE Kill him!128 ANOTHER ANGLE - INCLUDING BILLY moving a drugpad against Logan's face.Logan is holding his breath...desperately trying not to breathe the"Muscle" directly from the pad into his system. BILLY (chilling laugh) He's trying to hold his breath...As Billy presses the pad tighter against Logan's face:With all his might, Logan wrenches his arms loose... drops to theground and pulls out his gun.He fires and fire girdles a pillar...and they start to back away. BILLY We can rush him...we can take can take him again, we can!! The pack hesitates...stops backing away. LOGAN (moving the gun slowly back and forth) All right! How many of you want this to be Lastday?!The pack moves back again...and disperses, leaving Billy facingLogan alone. LOGAN Come on, Billy...come on...you cut a Sandman, didn't you?!Logan tucks the gun back into his waist. LOGAN Come on, Billy...cut me...Come onAfter a beat, Billy turns and runs away.Logan comforts the shivering Jessica for a moment then takes out thesmall box from his pocket and turns it...until it starts BEEPING.The CAMERA PANS Logan and Jessica...following the SOUND.They move over the rubble...and cautiously around abandonedbuildings.We HEAR A SCREAM...and HEAR the Cubs who've only obviously found andattacked someone. The SOUND is coming from a different directionthan where the beeping is coming from. LOGAN (shaking his head) They've got someone else! Why would anybody come here?Jessica shudders as the scream dies abruptly.The BEEPING is now very loud.Logan homes in on an abandoned building, enters, crosses swiftly toa door inside and kicks it down.We SEE the Runner. The WOMAN cringing, expecting death.129 FULL SHOT - LOGAN AND THE WOMAN frozen for a moment. In f.g. a figure stirs, moves and we see it isFrancis. His weapon is drawn and aimed, but as he watches, he lowersthe barrel and smiles. The is Logan's job.130 CLOSE ON - JESSICA watching131 LOGAN AND THE WOMAN WOMAN (nearing hysteria) There's been a terrible error! My Lifeclock must have broken in some way! (rising tone) I'm nowhere near thirty...look at me...I'm twenty-two. I should be green! Did you hear me? (shouting) Green! LOGAN (quietly) Don't be afraid-- Before Logan can continue...the Woman...who is now wild-eyed andhysterical lunges at Logan...and starts grappling with him. WOMAN I'll kill you!! I'll kill you!!After Logan pushes her away...and she falls down: LOGAN (breathing hard) I'm not going to hurt you.Slowly, she rises.Logan takes out the ankh. LOGAN Sanctuary? Anything?Logan reaches into his pocket and takes out a small roundobject...the size of a large marble. LOGAN If they find you throw this hard enough to break it. Then hold your breath till you get away...It's blind gas.Her reaction is blank, then, with desperate ferocity she attacksLogan again.During the course of the struggle, Logan subdues her again.Jessica enters, bends over the near-crazed Runner as Logan holdsher. Eyeing him, the woman stands and takes the small roundobject...she appears somewhat bewildered as Logan and Jessica moveoff. 132 EXT. - THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ABANDONED BUILDING - MED. ANGLE - FRANCIS WATCHINGHe is shocked, unbelieving. 133 CLOSE ON FRANCISStunned and uncertain, Francis aims his gun toward Logan andJessica...but he wavers...watching them disappear into the rubble... 134 ANOTHER ANGLE - FRANCISshivering like a wet dog. He turns toward open window. FRANCIS (in a firm, cold tone) Runner! The woman turns, staring insanely. Her mouth opens like a fish as:Francis FIRES his gun. A moment later, as the burning body topplesto the floor;134X1 MAZE-CAR PLATFORM - THE MEN hearing the unmistakable SCREAMING sound of the kill, they exchangea look.135 LOGAN AND JESSICA At the flash of FIRE from Francis' gun, they turn.Logan and Francis' eyes meet. A beat, then Logan grabs Jessica andpulls her away.136 FRANCIS After a long, long hesitation, takes out his small plastic box andstarts to speak into it: FRANCIS (quietly) Runner terminated at G.16 Ready for cleanup at Cathedral Quadrant 39. 137 ANOTHER ANGLE - OVERLOOKING CATHEDRAL ENTRANCE The Second and Third Men...very close to the maze-car platform...peering into the darkness and seeing Logan and Jessica emerge ontothe maze-car platform. We can tell from the way the two men look atone another that they believe Logan has fired the shot they haveheard.They hide from the approaching Logan and Jessica. SECOND MAN I almost believed her.They move off soundlessly. Behind them, a maze-car has arrived.138 MED. - ANGLE - FRANCIS Gun in hand...running through Cathedral toward the maze-carplatform.139 INT. - MAZE-CAR - LOGAN AND JESSICA - MOVING SHOT JESSICA I'm ashamed. I was bringing you to be killed. LOGAN Where? Sanctuary? Can you take me there? JESSICA Logan, I don't know where Sanctuary is. But if I take you to them, they'll kill you. LOGAN (a beat) All right. But why? I didn't kill the Runner. JESSICA (interrupting) Yes, but they won't know that...or care. They're hunting you, Logan. Maybe me too, now... LOGAN (wry laugh) That's nothing...there's a Sandman behind us, too and there'll be more soon. Take me to them. JESSICA (torn) I - I can't. LOGAN Then - why don't you leave me - go to them - explain JESSICA No. Not that either.Logan considers her. A long BEAT. Thinking, then: LOGAN All right. New You 483. I'll find out myself.139X1 INT. - SANDMAN READY ROOM - FRANCISDistracted...ignoring the greetings of Sandmen who are monitoringthe city.139X2 ANOTHER ANGLE - FRANCISWalking past the GIANT LIFECLOCKS into the debriefing area.The scanners begin moving.Moments later the scanner stops...the word: IDENTIFY appears on a SCREEN Francis pauses a moment and places his palm intothe groove.Now he takes out the items of the dead woman Runner and places themon the scanning table.An ALARM SOUNDS and the word: REJECTflashes on and off on the SCREEN.Sandmen come running into the Area. SANDMAN What happened?!Francis hesitates....then....quickly, as if changing his mind,taking the items off the table: FRANCIS Can you beat it....I've got the damn wrong bag. SANDMAN You ought to put yourself on reliefcall, Francis. FRANCIS (starting out) Yeah....140 EXT. - NEW YOU #483 - TWO SHOT - LOGAN AND JESSICA as they enter NEW YOU #483 they are being watched by:141 MED.

The chattyinformality is very much like people in a beauty parlor or barbershop.There is a RECEPTIONIST seated behind a desk in a corner.Logan and Jessica walk up to the desk.The receptionist looks at Logan...ignoring Jessica. RECEPTIONIST Hello, Sandman. LOGAN Hello. RECEPTIONIST Do you want to see Doc?Logan nods, impatient - he knows someone's watching. RECEPTIONIST We don't get many Sandmen. I think we've only had one other since I've been here. LOGAN (brusquely) A Sandman can get as sick of his face as anyone else. Where's the doctor? RECEPTIONIST (smiling) I like your face. Would you mind if Doc took a picture? I'd Like him to give your face to somebody else. LOGAN It's all right with me. Is he here? RECEPTIONIST My name's Holly...Holly 13. In ancient times they said my number was unlucky. Do you believe in luck? LOGAN No - Look, I'm in a hurry.

DOC (with pride) And I did it myself right on there.144 FULL - ANGLE - THE SURGICAL APPARATUSAesculaptor Mark III -- the latest in servo-surgical designs.Completely self-contained -- tilt-bed, cryojector services embeddedin the platform. The Mark III's laser heads are integrated into thewhole cocoon, swiveled and gimbaled so as to be able to focus any ofthe surgical beams in microscopic delicacy or wide-bladed scraping.The machine vaguely resembles an enormously complicated x-ray tableon an angle -- the great slotted laser heads overhanging it andIntegral with it. From the cryonic receptor base there is a steadyexhalation of cold -- the vapor seeping steadily downwards, blurringthe endlessly looped and tangled tubes and wires and containersWhich join in solid state circuitry so that any random orinvoluntary twitch of a patient will be instantly compensated by anequivalent move of the laser head -- keeping the focus precise.At one end -- where the halves of the Mark III join, is n console ofswitches and dials -- lights nod servo-recorders which control the operation from the first injection of cold to the final healingvacuum drafts and scar burnishing. With the air of a magiciandemonstrating, Doc goes to the console and flips switches. Instantlythe table responds -- the platform tilting, the crab-like laser armsdescending flexing -- small vapor jets oozing as the beams slashharmlessly across the table. Beaming, Doc turns it off and the wholeapparatus subsides. DOC I designed it myself. (slightest beat) What'll it be ...a face job or a full-body job? LOGAN Just the face. DOC Fine....Holly will get you ready. You're in good hands, believe me.Holly comes forward and unbuttons the collar on Logan's tunic.As Holly brushes her fingertips lightly down Logan's arms: DOC Holly works here because she gets a lift out of watching the Table... (smiles) and other things. I'll be back in a minute. HOLLY He's going to sterilize himself. LOGAN Do I have to undress? HOLLY Not for your face.Logan follows Holly to the Table. (Jessica remains behind with Docwho speaks to her with soft urgency). DOC You shouldn't have brought him here. JESSICA; I didn't bring him -- what's the difference. He's blinking. He wants to run. DOC Run!? He's a Sandman. JESSICA I tell you he's running. I know. DOC Maybe...Maybe. But I wish he'd gone somewhere else. (a beat, a shrug) All right. He gets a face. 144X1 THE SURGICAL TABLE - LOGAN AND HOLLYLogan lies down.The Table ripples...accepting his weight prisoning and positioninghim. HOLLY (leaning - close to Logan) I like dark hair. Have him give you dark hair. DOC'S VOICE All set? HOLLY Um huh. Would you take a picture of him, Doc? I'd like you to give his face to somebody else. DOC Why not?Doc pushes a button...there is a tiny FLASH. DOC Do you have anything special in mind? LOGAN I don't care...Just get it over with. DOC (smiling) Hurry...hurry...hurry. HOLLY (whispering) Dark hair. LOGAN Holly'd like dark hair. DOC Holly'd like a lot of things. (studying Logan's face) We can start by narrowing the cheekbones. Doc presses buttons on the control board. Jessica, who is standingnext to Doc, is slightly startled as the Table begins to HUM...as apair of laser beams separate themselves from the overhead clusterand extend toward Logan, forming inner cones as they approach.CryoJector needles start to close in on them, nearing their facesand shoulders slowly...the visible cold streaming off the points.A vibrobeam begins to KEEN.SOUND: An insistent chiming.Doc hears the sound and turns with the martyred air of a man who'sbeen called to the phone too many times. He turns to a phone-likeapparatus nearby, shifting the table into neutral as he turns. Thetable and the laser heads stop moving. DOC (as if speaking on a phone) Hello (listening) Yes (listening) Yes, they are. (listening; his expression changing) Done.Doc turns back to the console, pausing to stare intently at Logan,then up at the brightly smiling Holly. Something in his lookregisters, and Holly's smile fades. Now Doc engages the machineagain... DOC Pay attention, Sandman. I'm proud of this machine.As he speaks he presses and an arm sweeps downward and into positionnear Logan's face. It pauses as DOC With this one there's no waiting for scar burnishing. It's all in one...watch now...The laser arm sweeps across Logan's forehead and cheeks, leaving abright trail of blood as DOC But here's the improvement. Instant healing---before you feel a thing. Watch now...Doc pushes a special button and the arm sweeps back along the track,spraying healing fluid. Magically the blood vanishes and the skin ismoist and whole.144X2 THE SURGICAL TABLE - LOGAN His face tense--he knows something's wrong. Over him Holly's brightface with its rapt look. She's not sure, but she enjoys whatever'shappening.144X3 BACK TO DOC who is playing the console as he speaks. DOC Perfect depth adjustment on this one, Sandman. The beam will cut through that uniform and just exactly through the skin beneath-- absolute precision. Watch now And the machine does its stuff, slashing through Logan's tunic--aseam of blood following the rip. DOC Of course, it doesn't mend uniforms, Sandman, but otherwise it does everything, doesn't it? Just imagine what would happen to you if the healing stopped functioning. And the arm moves back again, spraying the healing fluid intoLogan's new wound. Again the blood disappears. Suddenly Doc's look is ferocious. He turns off the healing switchand punches buttons fiercely. The laser arms begin to move wildlyand the SOUNDS become shrill. Holly looks alarmed. HOLLY No! You're scrambling the table. He'll be cut to pieces, Doc. DOC Damn right! It was a trap. They know! LOGAN No - I'm Running!Machine begins to WHINE LOUDLY.Jessica tries to turn the machine off...Doc starts to wrestle withher as:145-145X4 INTERCUT: CLOSE ANGLES - THE CLUSTER ABOVE LOGAN Moving.HOLLYWatching two stun beams lower.Doc knocks Jessica down. She is groggy on the floor asThe stun beams lance into Logan's cheeks.The Table holds him, biting into his right leg below the knee.146-148 QUICK CUTS OF DOC AND HOLLY Watching intently as: 149-150 CLOSE ANGLES - LOGAN AND THE CLUSTER ABOVE HIMAs surgical beams slit his shirt from the shoulder to the waistleaving two threads of blood. A vacu-head dips to suck the bloodaway neatly.151 ANOTHER ANGLE - LOGANAs Logan desperately sucks in his belly....trying to flatten himselfinto the Table.152-153 CLOSE ANGLES - LOGAN AND THE CLUSTER ABOVE HIMAs laser blades cut into his face....followed by a spray of healingliquid on the cuts. 154 CLOSE - ON HOLLYExcited....flushed....as:155 CLOSE - ON LOGAN AND THE CLUSTER ABOVE HIMAs two wide blades of light sweep downward....and hover three inchesabove his neck....and keep lowering ....HUMMING loudly....and oneinadvertently frees Logan's right arm.156 CLOSE ON - DOCShocked as Logan reaches for his gun.157 CLOSE - ON LOGAN AND THE CLUSTER ABOVE HIM.As dozens of laser beams slash toward Logan....he twists away....andbreaks off....jumping off the Table.Doc rushes Logan holding what appears to he a frozen police billy. In an instant he has knocked Logan's gun away....and as Logan looksdown at it....we see it lying on the floor completely frozen.Slowly, Doc moves toward Logan the short smoke-colored stickmenacing in his hand. LOGAN (out-of-breath) What I told you is the....Abruptly, Doc lunges toward Logan...missing him as Logan ducks away.As Doc turns to attack....Logan smashes his elbows into Doc's chestand Doc falls back onto the Table.157X1 CLOSE ON - HOLLYSCREAMING, as Doc is slashed by the machine amid showers of sparksand gouts of steam as the metal twists and wires short out andvarious fluids boil and spill onto hot surfaces. Holly tries tofight her way into the mess to help Doc, but Jessica, recovering,pulls her down and the two struggle.157X2 CLOSE ON - DOCIn terror as the laser beams begin to slash him to ribbons.157X3 LOGANMaking an effort to stop the machine, pulling levers and pushingbuttons in vain. He sees what's happening, pulls Jessica away fromHolly and, grabbing up his gun and tunic, heads for the entrance.Crossing the waiting room they are stopped by the sight of:158-162XI OUT163 FRANCISEntering...gun in hand.164 REVERSE ANGLE - LOGAN AND JESSICAAs they face Francis.165 FULL ANGLE - FRANCIS LOGAN AND JESSICA FRANCIS (frowning) What's going on, Logan?! LOGAN It has nothing to do with you. FRANCIS (choking but still loyal) What are you talking about?! I saw you let a Runner go? (up a notch) I saw you, Logan?? Tell me!!Suddenly the machine behind them erupts into a great burst of smokeand noise, momentarily drawing Francis' attention. Instantly Loganjumps him, grabs and throws him sprawling. Without a look back, heand Jessica run out.166 OUT166X1 FRANCISEnraged, finds his gun on the floor and, before rising, gets off ashot at them as they disappear. Then leaping to his feet, dashingoff in pursuit.167 ARCADE TRACKING Logan and Jessica running through Arcade. 167X1 LOGAN AND JESSICA Suddenly she pulls him in another direction.

The Love Shop is throbbing withsexuality. In it, the darkness breaks at Irregular intervals -- whenbooths and cubicles flare into brilliance, each time revealing anorgiastic tableau. The Love Shop is multi-leveled and the randomflashes may appear from any direction at any time, blinding andstunning the viewer. Logan and Jessica pause to get their bearingsand as they do, a beautiful WANTON grabs Logan, pulling andlaughing: WANTON I have an empty one, SandmanLogan tries to pull away, looks around for Jessica just in time tosee a man almost carrying her off. Then the light is gone again andJessica with it.176 LOGAN AND THE WANTON As she tears at his clothing, wrapping herself around him, trying topull him down. Then, as the light flares again she suddenly lets goand grabs another man...Logan is, freed, starts looking for Jessica.177-179 SERIES OF SHOTSLogan hunting through the Love Shop, fighting them off.INTERCUT SHOTS of the suddenly-illuminated tableaus. Sex, manifoldand multiform -- everybody doing it.180 ANOTHER ANGLE - FRANCISEntering, starting to look around -- grabbed by one of the laughingWantons.181-182 LOGAN, JESSICABrief glimpses of them looking for each other.183 FRANCISHunting both.184 WITH LOGANAs he suddenly collides with a woman -- shoves her away and seesit's Jessica. Now together they make for an archway where multiplemirrors enclose them.Suddenly they are in darkness. Then a heavy door slides open andJessica leads Logan through the opening. Behind them the door slidesshut again. 185 FRANCISDesperately trying to get rid of a woman, sees a flash of Logan andJessica far across the room -sees them leave. Then he's pulled downagain as the orgy continues.186-186X1 OUT186X2 INT. - AN IMMENSE METAL STAIRWAY After a moment, Jessica takes Logan's hand and they start down inthe darkness. The SOUNDS of Love Shop still heard from behind thewall. LOGAN Are you taking me to them? JESSICA Yes. (beat) I don't know what else to do -- with him following us. (she hesitates) Why do you keep running from your-- LOGAN Because he's my friend - (a beat) and I don't want to be killed by him - or anyone. JESSICA He's good, isn't he? LOGAN Will he find us and kill us? Yes...or one of the others. (a beat) You know there's only one place to go now... JESSICA (hopelessly) They won't believe us. LOGAN (beat) I'd rather take my chances with them...than with Francis. JESSICA They won¹t listen. LOGAN (interrupting) You think Sandmen will? (before she can answer) There's no other way for me, JESSICA We'll convince them.They pause. He puts his hand over hers. Jessica is silent. Then sheturns his hand over. The crystal blinks red -- on, off. JESSICA Yes, Logan. (turning to him blindly) I'm glad they didn't change your face. Logan embraces her, but his look is strange and remote. Theycontinue down into the darkness. Behind them the SOUNDS of Love Shop die away and only theirfootsteps are heard.187 OUT 187X1 FRANCIS At the mirrored archway, looking around carefully, testing. He knowsthey went through somehow. Hands claw at him - he brushes them awayas he searches.188-200 OUT200X1 WITH LOGAN AND JESSICA They have come to the foot of the stair. Here the flooring shineswetly in the darkness. JESSICA (softly) Exactly four steps now. Let me lead you. (they walk) Now to the right. It's narrow here, you'll have to get behind me. LOGAN (whispering) How will they know we're coming? JESSICA (whispering) They're watching us now. They'll let us in when they're sure. 200X2 CLOSE-UP - LOGAN'S HAND (INSERT) As he fumbles the transceiver switches at his belt, punching out asignal.200X3 INT. - SANDMAN H.Q. READY ROOMAs the Sandmen monitoring SEE THE SIGNAL FLASH and move smoothlyinto action.200X4 LOGAN AND JESSICA Close together, he behind, waiting--alert as a VOICE is suddenlyheard: VOICE (scratchy, filtered) Sandman, put your hands on your head. (he does) Clasp your fingers together. Now turn your hands over. Palms up. (beat) In a moment a light will shine in your eyes. Walk into it--Jessica first, then you, Sandman. You will have to stoop--but don't unclasp your hands. Do you agree?Logan nods.Jessica glances back at him but their faces are unreadable in thedark. Then suddenly--in front of her--a blindingly bright, narrowrectangle of light illuminating them fiercely. Jessica movesforward. Even she has to stoop. Logan is close behind. As he bendsawkwardly into the opening, the light goes out.201 LOGAN, JESSICA -- SANCTUARY HQAs he pushes her through the opening then moves instantly to theside, pulling her with him.. The move fails. Both are pinnedhelplessly in the blinding glare of the spotlight and the suddenappearance of glass-silver spear points pressed against them. Loganis unable to draw his gun. VOICE Hold still, Sandman, or die where you are. 2ND VOICE Is she the one? OTHER VOICES (like angry stage whispers) She betrayed us. Kill him. Kill them both. Jessica you sold us. Sandman butcher. Sandman murderer.Logan and Jessica stand rigid against the spear points, only theirheads turning to the echoing sibilants.. The spotlight goes off.202-204 OUT205 INT. - SANCTUARY HQ. - LOGAN, JESSICA - CLOSE In the darkness we see the glass-silver spear points are glowing allaround them, the long shafts falling away into darkness, the points,steaming gently when they touch--making an instant, wincing burn.Logan moves--a spear point presses--he flinches. LOGAN I'm a runner. She brought me here because I begged her to help me.He turns his palm. The red crystal blinks impressively in thedarkness.At the sight, a BABBLE of SOUNDS. Argument. VOICE He's lying. No Sandman ever ran. 2ND VOICE You don't run. You kill runners. You have killed runners all your life. - LOGAN Yes I have. (beat) Now it's my turn. And I want to live.Another angry murmur of VOICES. Over it Jessica suddenly: JESSICA (shouting) What's the matter with you. He's a runner-- he's blinking. We must help anyone who asks...we must-or we're the same as they are--deciding who lives and dies.One of the points lifts and touches Jessica's cheek. A quick, fierceburn. She shrieks--a tiny sound--and is silent.206 LOGAN Reacts fiercely, spinning against the spear points, he is Jabbed andpierced in a dozen places as he manages to get Jessica closer,shielding her with his body. But the spear points are too much. Hesubsides, as VOICES rise angrily "Kill him now".Suddenly a RINGING ALARM. All sound stops at once and we hear aCLATTER of FOOTSTEPS down the iron stair and across the outer floor.The spotlight bursts on again and a figure staggers into thechamber, straightening into the light, hair dishevelled, hands infront against the glare. It's Holly. HOLLY Holly. Holly, New You 483... He's dead. Doc's dead and the Sandmen came... VOICE (gentle) Holly--Holly. Remember the code. The code, please Holly... HOLLY (hysteria) They smashed everything and I barely got away. (beat) Holly. Station 12, Sanctuary 7. Holly. Holly...She lowers her hands and we see her, tattered, frightened--thebright smile strange. She comes to herself a bit, looks to the sideand sees Logan and Jessica, pinned against the wall.She reacts with fear at the sight. HOLLY It's him! The first Sandman. He killed...Doc. JESSICA No, Holly--wait! He's running. Tell them the rest! HOLLY (suddenly exhausted) He's the one. You too. I remember. He was in a hurry. Just a face job. Dark hair, I said. Then he killed Doc and you grabbed me--and the machine blew up and I ran...I ran JESSICA Holly. Holly! Please...The other Sandman. Remember the one who came after--Holly suddenly remembers and the shock makes her lucid. HOLLY (pouring it out) That's right. The other one came after. The older one. Smashing, killing, burning! JESSICA (coaching desperately) ...and he was hunting the first one, this one. Wasn't he? Wasn't he? This one was running, the other one was hunting him... HOLLY (remembers) Yes. Oh yes. (to Logan) He was after you. I remember. You're running!207-208 OUT208X1 ANOTHER ANGLE 1The spear points are withdrawn. Logan and Jessica relieved butshaken, wary. LOGAN May we move?A long beat. Then-- VOICE I saw we pass them through. Somebody help Holly. Other VOICES mumble agreement. Holly moves off into the dark room,hands reaching out to help her. VOICE You two. Just go straight ahead. Follow the corridors with the pipes overhead to the end. Then use the key.As the voice speaks the spotlight finally goes off and by a dim glowaround the perimeter, we see we're in some kind of large undergroundchamber--some part of the vast undercellars of the city. The lightis enough to reveal that there are perhaps twenty people in theroom, reds and greens both--but all are silhouetted, no face seen.There's a kind of aisle open down the room's center and it'sobviously the way they are to go. Logan and Jessica move off. Loganpauses. LOGAN I don't know who you are. I'd like to thank someone. VOICE It doesn't matter who we are. Follow the tunnel to the end. LOGAN I Will there be someone to tell us where to go from there...?A murmur of discussion then: VOICE Someone will follow. When you come to the lock, he will tell you how Co go on the other side. Jessica may go with you as far as the lock. LOGAN (a deep breath) No. Jessica goes back now. Take her back. (suddenly his tone is urgent as he speaks to her) Now! Go on back. Back outside, Jessica.She is bewildered by the change. JESSICA Why?- No...no...I'm going with you. VOICE1 Only to the lock. After that there's no way back. JESSICA (small voice) I don't care. I'm going to Sanctuary. With you.A BABBLE of VOICES. "Impossible"...She ignores, watches Logan. JESSICA (cont'd) Will you take me with you? LOGAN Why, Jessica? You're still a green. JESSICA shakes her head. She doesn't know why.Logan puts his arm around her, marveling, trying to understand,moved. But suddenly he remembers the urgency of the moment. Hewheels, pulling her with him. LOGAN Come on then--they'll be here any minute!Uncomprehending, she starts to run with him. Too late. An EXPLOSIONshakes the chamber--the wall bellies inward and a group of Sandmen,led by Francis, burst into the room, firing as they come. Panic. Turmoil. PEOPLE running, SCREAMING--the ALARM BELL RINGING,RINGING as Sandmen methodically slaughter the people in the wreckageof the room.209 OUT209X1 LOGAN AND JESSICA As the brief, one-sided battle rages, echoing SHOTS and SCREAMS inthe dust filled room, Logan pulls her down out of the way. Theywatch, helplessly. Suddenly the figure of a Sandman looms beforethem. He stares at Logan, unsure. Logan reacts, draws, fires. TheSandman is smashed away, burning.209X2 LOGAN Suddenly aware that he has killed a Sandman. Jessica pulls him downagain into the shadow. Neither realizes chat the soft pulsing of hiscrystal can be seen from the room.210 ANOTHER ANGLEFrancis, quartering the room like a hound, searching, searching,stopping as he sees211 FRANCIS P.O.V. The crystal blinking red, eerie in the darkness. FRANCIS (believing the blinking crystal is Jessica's) Logan. I know you're in here. What've you done...gone crazy over a Runner? (whispering) Nobody knows except me. You know I won't say anything. I should have turned you in but I couldn't. Leave her. Come on out with me. It'll look like you're part of the group that hit this nest. (pleading) Logan...you're a Sandman! (slightest beat) Logan...now...now...Logan...After the slightest beat, Logan FIRES and Francis falls, a greatchunk of the cave roof falling between him and Logan -- all visionobscured while EXPLOSIONS and SCREAMS continue.212 LOGAN AND JESSICAAs he pulls her shakily to her feet. She nods, she's okay. He leadsher off down the tunnel.213 WITH LOGAN AND JESSICA - TUNNELfollowing the tracks. The way leads down, curves, recurves, butalways down.214 ANOTHER ANGLE - INCLUDING LOCK As Logan and Jessica rush toward it. The corridor has widened into akind of chamber which ends in a great metal door like an immensesubmarine hatch.The tracks run straight to it and beneath it. The base of the door tands in a couple of inches of water. With great urgency, Logan and Jessica examine the huge door. Logangives the wheel a tug...nothing.SOUND: A WHIRRING like clockwork...A METALLIC BELL SOUND and then aRECORDED VOICE. VOICE Runner, this is the last gate. Use your key now. When the Bell sounds again...use your key. Good luck, Runner. May you find Sanctuary.SILENCE. Then the BELL CHIME SOUND and a light illumines the centerof the wheel where there's a kind of keyhole. The WHIRRING continuesfor about ten seconds. Then it stops and the light goes out.214X1 LOGAN AND JESSICA Hearing a SOUND they turn and see: 214X2 ANOTHER ANGLE - P.O.V.Far behind them, in the wet glisten of the tunnel, a bobbing lightand shadow -- the SOUND of RUNNING215-216 CLOSE ON - LOGAN AND JESSICAAs Jessica takes the ankh from her neck - fumbling with the chain. JESSICA (breathlessly) Every key only works once...and only a Lastday key must open this door.... They said it would fit - but....She tries to fit the ankh into the glowing one, but her hand shakes.Logan tries to steady her - and in helping, she drops it into thedark pool of water. They fall to their knees, searching desperately.Then Logan remembers. LOGAN Wait - I have the one I took from the Runner.SOUND: The same as before as Logan searches his pockets for theRunner's ankh.Logan finds it just as the WHIRRING SOUND has STOPPED again...andthe light has gone out again in the center of the wheel.As Logan and Jessica wait for the sound, etcetera to repeat againanother TREMENDOUS EXPLOSION is heard rocking everything. In thedistance, Jessica can see the shadow of a FIGURE approaching.As the SOUND, etcetera, repeat-s once more...Logan pushes the ankhinto the lighted center of the wheel. The ankh fuses and the lightedcenter becomes brighter as the door opens.There is a hesitation...in which Logan turning his head back...realizes what he has done and is shaken.As the shadowed FIGURE looms LARGER: JESSICA There's no turning back, is there?Logan turns and pushes Jessica through the door... following her...as the door closes and they are:217 ON THE OTHER SIDE now, they can still hear the SOUND, etcetera for the last time.Beyond the lock is the ruins of a vast undersea complex in whichfood was raised and harvested. What we see is an endless shadowylabyrinth of breeding pens which stretch off into the green darkness-- a kind of mammoth aquarium with catwalks and ramps intersectingthe huge tanks. The levels are multiple and everything is slimed,rusted, rotted and wet.In the tanks themselves are shoals of fish, gardens of seaweed, etc.The machinery for harvesting and winnowing has long since gone torust -- and visible in the great tanks are the wrecks of vessels andgear -- the kind of stuff Cousteau and Co. are using now.Footing is dangerous -- a slip from any catwalk means a plunge intowater and some of the walkways are well under water anyhow. From aninvisible ceiling comes a steady dripping and everything is crustedand smells of salt and decay and life in the darkness.217X1 WITH FRANCIS As he arrives at the door, the ankh glowing as before.But Francis has a light. He examines the door with it, and as itlights the pool of water on the ground, it picks out Jessica's ankh.FRANCIS stoops, gets it and looks from it to the one glowing 128 LOGAN AND JESSICA Bewildered -- uncertain, as their eyes adjust to the dim light.Finally, Logan gestures ''this way" and sets out.(NOTE: The action of the sequence is the action of people gropingthrough a labyrinth. They go along, gripping a rail where possible,sometimes sinking deep into water, sometimes rising above it. Theyrun into blind endings and retrace to the last junction -- alwaystrying for what looks driest and seems to stretch farthest along thegreat wall...)219-224 WITH LOGAN AND JESSICA - SERIES OF CUTS A. Making their way along the walkway side by side.B. Stopping as the walkway disappears under water. Logan wading inwhile she waits -- until he re-emerges. She follows. C. Choosing between diverging ramps. Having to return. JESSICA How do we know this is the right way? LOGAN It's the only way. D. POV an alley way full of machinery. Logan gives a wheel a halfturn -- great rusty net-combs start to winnow the water.E. Helping Jessica, Logan slips...falls into darkness. Jessica'sfear until he emerges, hand over slimy hand. The water is cold.F. POV ancient signs - PROTOPLANK...DEPOT NO #11 DO NOT DECANT...HABITAT MARITIME...ETC.They speculate. JESSICA What do you suppose this was...? LOGAN Some kind of breeding pens...I suppose...They say people used to breed animal s, fish, anything (at her disbelieving look) To eat, of course. JESSICA Ycch. (shudders) To kill things and then eat them. It must have been a savage world. Logan shrugs, but the idea makes him queasy, too. G. They stop, tired. Peer through at the wreckage of a smallinspection vessel and suddenly hear:SOUND: FOOTSTEPS, coming, halting, WATER sloshing. Steps again.225 POV - THROUGH THE MAZE OF TANKS - A LIGHT moving, hunting. LOGAN (alert) Stay here, while I see what it is. Jessica nods, frightened. Logan slips off into the darkness. In amoment he's back. His face - is grim. JESSICA It's Francis, isn't it?He nods.226 LOGAN AND JESSICATrying to move faster now, Logan makes a wrong turning and they mustgo back. But as they do so, Francis is ever closer -- a giganticdistorted SHAPE now visible through the eerie glass -then suddenlyseeming small and distant.As they emerge from the blind alley once again close to the wall,suddenly:227 FRANCISlooming huge, gun drawn, apparently only a few feet away.228 LOGAN AND JESSICA Logan desperately claws at machinery, succeeds in starting motion,somewhere what sounds like a GENERATOR begins laboring, ancientmachinery GROANS. They turn and run as they HEAR: FRANCIS (distorted; echo; etcetera) LOGAN N N N. 229 POV - FRANCIS' LIGHTis splashing the walls ahead and in it they suddenly see:THE DOOR -- a waterlock with a wheel. As the light passes, Loganheaves desperately on it. It starts to give as the light comes backand they are revealed.230 CLOSE - ON FRANCISaiming at Logan...then slowly moving his hand until Jessica is inhis sights.231 LOGAN - JESSICA - FRANCIS Francis FIRES -- tremendous SOUND, ECHOING and RESOUNDING. One ofthe great tanks buckles and a cascade of water erupts overeverything. Through it, Logan manages to get the door open andpushes a half-drowning Jessica through.232 INT. - THE SHAFT A sort of ancient freight elevator which commences to move groaningwhen the waterlock door closes. Logan slumps to the floor.233 INT. - SHAFT - TWO SHOT - LOGAN AND JESSICA Moving at an extremely high speed...We can see the outside -flickering - dark, light, - dark, light... and finally to a whitecolor. They lie slumped, motionless. Finally it stops. The dooropens into a kind of glistening darkness, suffused by a bluish glow.It is now very cold.In the silence Logan stirs. Groping, he touches Jessica, who movesclose to him. Logan puts his arm around her and they rise. Slowly,tentatively, he leads her out into the dark chamber where they standfor a moment trying to find themselves. What little light there isseems to come from the left. Arm around Jessica, Logan starts tomove. JESSICA (whispering) I'm afraid. LOGAN It's brighter there...besides, we can't go back.He starts to move again but Jessica hangs back. JESSICA Wait.He halts. JESSICA (cont'd) I don't know what's going to happen to us Logan but -- (a beat) Are you glad you didn't kill him? LOGAN It doesn't make any difference anymore. JESSICA You're really one of us now, aren't you? LOGAN You knew that I wasn't before, didn't you? (Jessica nods) Why did you stay with me? JESSICA (feelingly) I wanted to... (Logan puts his arms around her) ...And you...what made you kill Sandmen? LOGAN I had to. I did kill...for the first time in my life I killed. JESSICA Because you felt like a Runner, didn't you. LOGAN I guess so...I know I felt something I never felt before...and I didn't like it...not a bit. (after another long beat) I'll tell you one thing...Sanctuary better be worth it. That's the last place for me to live now. JESSICA For us.Logan mouths "Us"...a strange word...and why not... in the lastminutes he has done strange things.234-236 OUT 236x1 INT. - ICE CAVERNSuddenly they are blinded by a brilliant light coming from the sideand revealing for the first time where they are.236x2 ANGLEBefore them a vase, dim, ice-shrouded storage area, row upon endlessrow of frozen lockers trailing away into darkness, their legends andcontents unreadable in the thick covering of ice and frost. To theside, a bright light. 236x3 LOGAN AND JESSICAWalk toward the light.236x4 WITH LOGAN AND JESSICAWe see a huge, high-domed cavern ringed and ornamented withextraordinary ice sculptures-They are everywhere: Otters, fish, atusked walrus---overhead a flight of birds.236x5 ANOTHER ANGLEAs they look in wonder: VOICE Overwhelming, isn't it?Logan and Jessica turn and see:237-238 OUT239 FULL ANGLE - BOX Box is half-man...half-metal.From the midpoint of his sternum to his hips he is coils and cables.One hand is a cutting tool.
