DUNWITTY			Let's sit down over there.										9.Dunwitty and Delacroix sit on the sofa.				DUNWITTY (CONT'D)			I'm sorry about my blowup but I			have to have a whipping boy every			meeting.				DELACROIX			I understand.  But again, in all			honesty I was not informed.				DUNWITTY			Forget it.  I believe you're my			most creative person I've got on			staff.  You're hip.  You know			what's happening.  I got some corny			white boys and girls writing for me.Delacroix doesn't join him in his laughter because hedoesn't know how to take that comment or where Dunwitty isheaded with it.				DUNWITTY (CONT'D)			I understand Black culture.  I grew			up around black people all my life.			If the truth be told I probably			know "niggers" better than you,			Monsieur Delacroix.  Please don't			get offended by my use of the			quote-unquote N word.  I got a			black wife and three bi-racial			children, so I feel I have a right			to use that word.  I don't give a			damn what Spike says, Tarantino is			right.  Nigger is just a word.  If			Dirty Ole Bastard can use it every			other word so can I.				DELACROIX			I would prefer you not use that			word in my presence.				DUNWITTY			NIGGER.  NIGGER.  NIGGER.

He's a bloody pulp.										  10.CLOSE ONDelacroix.He straightens his tie.				DELACROIX (CONT'D)			Who's a nigger now?POW.  This is a fantasy in Delacroix's mind.  We go BACK TOREALITY.  Everything's how we left it.				DUNWITTY			The material you've been creating			is too white bread.  White people			with black faces.  The Huxtable's,			Cosby, revolutionary.  But that's			dead.  We can't go down that road			again.				DELACROIX			I don't agree.  The Negro middle			class does exist, and it's rich			material for a dramatic series or			sitcom.				DUNWITTY			I'm telling you it's not.He goes to his desk, picks up Delacroix's scripts and startsthrowing them one by one against the window.				DUNWITTY (CONT'D)			The middle class black family moves			into a white suburban enclave.  The			middle class black family moves			into a small Southern town that is			run by the KKK.  The middle class			single black father raises his			teenage daughter.  The middle class			single black father raises his			teenage daughter.  The middle class			single black mother raises her			teenage son.  And so on and so			forth.  It's too clean, too			antiseptic...				DELACROIX			...to white?  I still feel all of			my scripts would make good shows.										  11.				DUNWITTY			Delacroix, wake up, brother man.			The reason why they didn't get			picked up was because nobody - and			I mean NOBODY - niggers and crackers			alike wants to see that junk.				DELACROIX			I've never been given a fair shot.				DUNWITTY			You got your head stuck up your ass			with your Harvard education and			your pretentious ways.  Brother			man, I'm blacker than you.  I'm			keepin' it real and you're frontin',			trying to be white.				DELACROIX			I'm an oreo, a sell out?  Because I			don't aspire to do HOMEBOYS FROM			OUT OF SPACE, SECRET DIARY OF			DESMOND PFEIFFER, A PJ's or some as			you might put it, some "nigger"			show?  I'm a Tom?  I'm whiter than			white and you're blacker than black?			Is that what you think?				DUNWITTY			That's exactly what I think.  I			want you to create something that			people want to see.  Let's be			honest, the majority of the people			in the country are deaf, dumb and			blind and I'm including 35 million			African-Americans.  You know and I			know "niggers" set the trend, set			the styles.  This is a golden			opportunity now.  These idiots have			to be led to the water.				DELACROIX			I'm not sure if I can deliver what			you want.				DUNWITTY			You will or you'll be back at BET			so quick you'll never know what hit			you.  I need a mid-season			replacement and pronto.  It will be			on the fast track.										  12.				DELACROIX			What is it you want from me?  Some			plantation follies?  Some sitcom			that takes place on a watermelon			patch?  Some show that follows four			nigger generations of junkies and			crackheads?  You want me to go back			to the ante bellum days?				DUNWITTY			Yes!  Yes!  Yes!  I want a show			that will make headlines, that will			have millions and millions of			households tuned in, glued to their			televisions every week.  I want			advertisers dying to buy on this			show.  I'm gonna squeeze this show			out of you if it kills you.EXT.

BIG BLACK			If you were really down you would			get us together with that boss of			yours.  What's his name again?				SLOAN			Delacroix.				BIG BLACK			Yeah, him.				SLOAN			What makes you think he would write			a show about the Mau-Mau's.				BIG BLACK			C'mon, why not?  The Monkees had a			show.  Look at all that other junk			that's on TV.  We got underground			cult following.										  27.				SLOAN			You don't have the demographics.				BIG BLACK			So are you telling me that you			wouldn't even introduce me to			Delacroix or set up a meeting?  I'm			talking 'bout me, your only brother,			ya own flesh and blood, hook a			brother up, youknowwhatI'msayin'.				SLOAN			That'swhatI'msayin'.  I'm not			blowin' my young career, brother or			no brother, for you or anybody else.				BIG BLACK			There is a name, a term for your			kind, the likes of you.  Back in			slavery days, you would be			classified as a house nigga.				SLOAN			If you think I'm a house nigga then			that's your prerogative.  You got			your ways to affect change, I have			mine.  And I would appreciate it			very much if you took ya field			nigga ass out of my house.				BIG BLACK			My own sister throwin' me out.  I			hope to seeya later when you get ya			mind right.  Don't bother letting			me out.				SLOAN			That's mighty black of you.Big Black slams the door.INT. DUNWITTY'S OFFICE - MORNINGOne by one, the team enters the office and sits down on thesofa.				DUNWITTY			Delacroix, I'm glad you got your			mind right.				DELACROIX			It's right and tight.  Good morning,			let me introduce you to everybody.			You know my assistant, Sloan.										  28.				SLOAN			Hello.				DELACROIX			This is Cheeba.				CHEEBA			Nice to meet you.				DELACROIX			And this is Manray.				MANRAY			How do you do?				DUNWITTY			Good.  I like the names.  Very			theatrical.				DELACROIX			We're all happy to be here and I'm			going to paint a picture for you.				DUNWITTY			I'm wid it.				DELACROIX			I've done a lot of soul searching			and once again you are right.  In			my previous work it's been all			surface, superficial.  I have never			really dug deep.  Not anymore.  As			Mark Twain fully understood satire			is the way.  Race has always been a			hot button in this country's			history and it needs to be pushed			harder.  If we are ever to live			side by side in peace and harmony.			It's about promoting racial healing.				DUNWITTY			Go on.  Good so far.				DELACROIX			I know you're familiar with minstrel			shows.  They came about at the turn			of the 19th century.  It was a			variety show in which the talent			was in blackface - singing, dancing,			telling jokes, doing skits.			Dunwitty, I ask you when was the			last time there was a good variety			show on the air.  Carol Burnett?			HeeHaw?										  29.				DUNWITTY			Word!!!				DELACROIX			So let's take this great form, this			very American tradition of			entertainment into the 21st century,			into the new millennium.				DUNWITTY			The name of the show?				DELACROIX			It is called: MANTAN - THE NEW			MILLENNIUM MINSTREL SHOW.				DUNWITTY			I'm lovin' it.  You know how I know?			Because I'm getting a boner, my			Johnson is hard, no disrespect my			sister.Dunwitty starts walking around his office, pumping his first.				DUNWITTY (CONT'D)			I'm feelin' dis'!				DELACROIX			It will take a lot of courage and			backbone on the part of the CNS to			get this on the air.  In fact, I			would understand fully if the			subject matter is deemed too			risque, too controversial.				DUNWITTY			Don't worry about that, that's my			department.  Now who do we cast?			We need a star.  Can Whoopi sing or			dance?				DELACROIX			I don't know if Whoopi is the way			to go.				DUNWITTY			Are these our two stars, sitting			here in front of my nose?  Which			one is Mantan again?				MANTAN			That's me.										  30.				DELACROIX			And Cheeba is Sleep 'n' Eat.CLOSE ONCheeba.  A look of surprise is on his face.  Complete, uttersurprise.				DUNWITTY			That's a great handle.				DELACROIX			Mantan and Sleep 'n Eat.  Two real			coons.  I know we're way out there			but it's satire.				DUNWITTY			I want you take it there.  All the			way to the edge and back.Sloan looks at Delacroix with concern.				DELACROIX			Every week we follow the trials and			tribulations of two real coons -			Mantan and Sleep 'n Eat.  The Dusky			Duo.				DUNWITTY			What are there character traits?				DELACROIX			Ignorant, dullwitted, lazy, and			unlucky.				DUNWITTY			Exactly!				DELACROIX			Mantan is an uneducated Negro who			always by some stroke of			unbelievable stupidity makes his			best laid plans go haywire.				DUNWITTY			And Sleep 'n Eat is his comical			sidekick?				DELACROIX			Yep, you guessed it.				DUNWITTY			This could be bigger than "Amos and			Andy."										  31.				DELACROIX			Protest finally forced "Amos and			Andy" off the air.  Could stop us			from ever getting on.				DUNWITTY			Let'em try.  I will kill to make			this happen.Delacroix looks at Sloan.				DELACROIX			Negroes would be in an uproar.				DUNWITTY			So what.  We would just give the			NAACP a donation that would be the			end of that.  No such thing as bad			publicity.  So what.  Earlier you			said singing and dancing.				DELACROIX			Mantan right here is a gifted			hoofer.  He has educated feet.				DUNWITTY			Who are the other characters?				DELACROIX			Do we have characters?  How about			Honeycutt, Snowflake, Rastus,			Nigger, Jim, Sambo, Jungle Bunny,			and how could we forget Aunt Jemima.Dunwitty is dying with laughter.  He's the only one.				DUNWITTY			We gonna hit 'em wid da BOMB DICKEY			on dis' one.  What's the setting?				DELACROIX			In the projects.  Like Eddie			Murphy's "The PJ's."				DUNWITTY			Ya first bad move.  Projects been			done.  That's one of the problems			now, everything, movies, TV, are			set in the urban jungle, da hood.			That's so tired.  Mantan's			Millennium Minstrel Show should be			set on a plantation.  In Alabama.				(MORE)										  32.				DUNWITTY (CONT'D)			And every week these Alabama porch			monkeys will make us cry, make us			laugh, make us look at our own			humanity.  Make us feel good to be			alive.				DELACROIX			I don't know about that plantation			angle.				DUNWITTY			What are you talkin' 'bout?  It's			the move.  Stay wid me now.  We're			movin' fast.  What does everybody			else think about this?				SLOAN			We'd get a lot of mail.She laughs, it's a fake one at that.				SLOAN (CONT'D)			Mr. Dunwitty, there wouldn't be			another show like it.				CHEEBA			I've always wanted to be on			television.				DUNWITTY			I like you.  Sleep 'n Eat.  That's			funny.  Mantan, how do you feel			about performing in black face?				MANTAN			As long as the hoofing is real,			that I can do my thing, I can			blacken up.  Let me hit it, beats			and rhythms, express myself.				DUNWITTY			Show me a little somethin' somethin'.Mantan starts to put on his new tap shoes.				DUNWITTY (CONT'D)			Delacroix, you dug deep, deeper			than deep.Mantan is ready.										  33.				MANTAN			I'm gonna give you just a taste.			My tap shoes are brand new.  I			haven't trained 'em yet.He starts to work out.				MANTAN (CONT'D)			Rhythms, rhythms, rhythms.  Beats,			beats, beats.  No Fred Astaire			here, baby.  Just rawness.Dunwitty clears his desk of everything, just knocks stuffflying onto the floor.  And Mantan taking the cue, jumps upon his desk and really starts hitting it.CLOSE ONDelacroix, as he watches his creation, it's not a happy face.CLOSE ONMantan, he's bringing it home.

He's			off the hiz-hook!				DELACROIX			We think so.				DUNWITTY			Sleep 'n Eat, what do you do?				CHEEBA			I play the straight man.  I do some			singing and dancing also.  I also			manage Mantan.				DUNWITTY			Oh you do so?				CHEEBA			I'm the man behind the man behind			the man.				DUNWITTY			You da man.										  34.				CHEEBA			No, you da man.				DUNWITTY			I'm gonna run upstairs with this.			If CNS doesn't want to do this,			somebody else will have da balls to			pull the trigger.  I want to thank			each and every one of you.  This is			great, Delacroix.  I'll get back to			you later today.EXT. STREET - DAYCheeba and Mantan are walking in midtown Manhattan.

ORCHID			You hear me talkin' to you.  The			only time you come up here when			something is wrong.				DELACROIX			C'mon, Mommy, don't start with that			I'm an ungrateful son stuff.				ORCHID			I said no such thing.  All I said			is that something must be wrong.She sits down with him.				ORCHID (CONT'D)			How's the food?				DELACROIX			Can't beat it with a hammer.  Well,			since you asked, it looks like I			may have a new show, a pilot being			shot.				ORCHID			That's wonderful.  Isn't that what			you always wanted, a show of your			own?He talks between mouthfuls.										  39.				DELACROIX			It was.  It is.  But this is a			different kind of show.				ORCHID			If at first it's not what you want,			just work that much harder, Peerless.				DELACROIX			Mommy, please don't call me that.				ORCHID			Son, Peerless is your name.  Now			you might be one of these Hollywood			types, change your name and all			that but Peerless Dothan is on your			birth certificate.				DELACROIX			I know what's on my birth			certificate.  You heard from Daddy?				ORCHID			I guess he's still on the road.			What kind of show is this?  Are			they some Negroes in it without			being buffoons?				DELACROIX			To answer your question, there are			a lot of Negroes in it and what is			your definition of buffoons?				ORCHID			Peerless, I didn't raise a buffoon.			We have enough of those on			television already.				DELACROIX			Please let me know when you hear			from Daddy, get a number or			something.				ORCHID			I will.  And good luck with your			show.

RESTAURANT - NIGHTA celebration is going on as Delacroix, Sloan, Cheeba andMantan sit at a table.ANGLE ONTable.  Cheeba and Mantan are giddy.  Sloan looks atDelacroix who is visibly not happy.				SLOAN			You okay?				DELACROIX			I feel like somebody hit me upside			da head with a sledgehammer.				CHEEBA			DeLa - what's the matter with you.				MANTAN			You ain't happy about the green			light?				SLOAN			People show their happiness in a			lot of different ways.				MANTAN			Well, homeboy, looks like he's at a			funeral.				DELACROIX			I'm happy for all of us.  It's just			we have a great responsibility now.			The pressure is on.				MANTAN			Pressure?  DeLa, you don't know			what the hell real pressure is.			SHEEETT!!!  This is lightstuff.			Now when you scramblin' out on the			street in da January winter and the			hawk is talkin' to you with NO			money and NO prospects of money			anytime soon, now that there is			some pressure.				DELACROIX			I didn't mean it to sound like that.										  41.				MANTAN			That's the way it came out.  Let me			ask you one question.  Have you			ever been in want, in need your			entire privileged life?				DELACROIX			Now I'm privileged?!  Why?  Because			I didn't grow up on food stamps and			welfare?  Because I didn't call			home a cardboard box?  No, I never			ever went to bed hungry and I'm			proud of it, too.  Whoever told you			that living in poverty earns you			somekind of badge of honor flat out			lied to you.				MANTAN			The point I'm trying to make is			that this is a blessing.  It's			going to be fun doing this show and			we should all look at it that way.Delacroix gets up from the table and leaves.				CHEEBA			What's wrong with him?				MANTAN			Must be the pressure.Cheeba and Mantan laugh, give each other some dap.  A highlyattractive PUERTO RICAN female walks over to their table.This is JESSICA GRILLO.				JESSICA			Sorry I'm late.Cheeba and Mantan are in awe.				SLOAN			Hey, girl.  This is my best friend,			Jessica Grillo.  I invited her down			to celebrate with us.				CHEEBA			I'm Cheeba.

Dunwitty had			to be enlightened.  I was making a			point.  I take pride in my work.			Plus, I already told you I wasn't			gonna walk away from my money.				SLOAN			Fuck da money.  Why do through all			this effort?  Why?  Are you looking			for love from Dunwitty?  For			respect?  Dunwitty and his likes			don't give a goddamn about you.  So			now what are you gonna do?Someone begins to pound on the bathroom door.				WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)			Will you please let me in?  I have			to use the toilet.

DELACROIX			Even if money wasn't an issue,			Dunwitty will still go ahead			without me and that could be more			dangerous.				SLOAN			What's the chances of MANTAN being			picked up?				DELACROIX			I wouldn't bet against it.  My			Negroidal ass is stuck between the			proverbial rock and a hard place.				SLOAN			Like I said, all this for some			twisted, distorted sense of			principal.  Dunwitty, he just			tolerates your Negroidal ass, he			doesn't respect it.The banging starts again.

Sloan and Delacroix file past the strangelooks of the manager and FIVE WOMEN waiting to use thebathroom as they rush in.INT. DUNWITTY'S OFFICE - MORNING				DELACROIX			I strongly feel that a Negro should			direct this.  This kind of satire			is a high wire act in a gale storm.			One misstep and we're doing "Amos			and Andy."  Only a Negro will have			the sensitivity and cultural			awareness to navigate this dangerous			terrain.				DUNWITTY			To hire someone solely on their			ethnicity, gender or religion is			not right.  It's un-American.  I			will hire someone who is most			qualified for this particular job.										  45.				DELACROIX			I was hoping to perhaps direct some			episodes myself, if not the pilot			soon after.				DUNWITTY			I want a hot, young white director.			Maybe the kid, that pheenom who			just did that hot new sexy Madonna			video.				DELACROIX			You're telling me some white boy is			gonna direct this pilot?				DUNWITTY			I just want you to meet him.  Keep			an open mind.				DELACROIX			Besides, what does he know about			Negroes?				DUNWITTY			Probably nuthin', but that's why			it's such a sexy way to go.			Sometimes an outsider has a fresh			new outlook, a different unique			perspective.  A black director,			y'know what he's gonna do given the			subject matter?  With this kid, the			possibilities are endless.				DELACROIX			What are his qualifications besides			being a white male and directing a			hot new sexy freaky Madonna video?				DUNWITTY			If Spielburg can direct "The Color			Purple" and "Amistad", our whiz kid			can direct the Mantan pilot.				DELACROIX			That's exactly my point.  Has he			even directed actors before in			anything?				DUNWITTY			No!!!  Just meet the guy.  That's			all I'm asking.  Look, I'll even			let you choose your own musical			director.  You can have that.										  46.				DELACROIX			In the immortal words of Derrick			Coleman, WHOOOPDEEDAMNDOO!!!				DUNWITTY			Derrick Coleman, he possessed all			the talent in the world, coulda,			shoulda, been a great ballplayer			but alas D.C. didn't want it bad			enough.  Delacroix, do you want it?

DELACROIX			I've never worked with any of you			and you've never worked with me so			we'll be starting from scratch.			I'm a fair person, a straight			shooter and I don't hold my tongue.

As a minority I can			relate to your struggle also.  But			I think you should give us all a			chance.  We want this pilot to be			successful just as much as you.			Please don't be so quick to judge			us based only on our whiteness.				DELACROIX			Oh, is that what I'm doing?BETH jumps in.				BETH			I think because of our background			we can bring a unique perspective			to Mantan.SETH pipes in also.				SETH			A fresh pair of eyes.  A new look,			insight, new angle that hasn't been			seen before.				DELACROIX			I've heard this somewhere before.David raises his hand.										  48.				DAVID			My name is David.  I do think it			would be better to have some			African-American writers but for			whatever reason they are not here.			I don't know if they couldn't find			any people with experience, they			wouldn't work for the pay or			refused to work for the show.  I			don't know and nobody in this room			probably knows either.

AARON			You pole are going to far back for			me.  I think we have to go after a			hipper feel.  Like the stuff Eddie			Murphy used to do on "Saturday			Night Live."				PETER			Or Martin.

MYRNA			Good question, straight to the			point.  I like your style.  Because			of the content of the show we can			expect some spirited reactions.				DUNWITTY			Myrna is here to help us plan our			strategy.				MYRNA			The best defense is offense.				DELACROIX			I thought it was the other way			around.				MYRNA			You get my point.

DUNWITTY			Goldfarb, run it down for them.										  88.				MYRNA			The Mantan Manifesto.  Catchy ain't			it?  Number One.

SLOAN			It sounds kinda simplistic to me.				MYRNA			I've done my research.				DELACROIX			These are black folks we're talkin'			about, not some lab mice in a cage.				MYRNA			Monsieur Delacroix, I got my PhD in			African-American studies from Yale,			so I do feel I'm qualified.				DUNWITTY			Let Myrna finish.				MYRNA			Thank you.  And always smile.				DELACROIX			Yeah, show dem pearly whites.She ignores him.				MYRNA			Wear Kente cloth, invoke the name			of Dr. Martin Luther King, use the			word "community" often when talking			about Mantan.

Let's get right into it.  You have			been called by some in the community			a traitor, a sellout, an Uncle Tom.			Why does your show generate such			feelings?				DELACROIX			Because race has always been a			sensitive issue in this country.			Gary, I have no problem with people			disagreeing with the show, it's			when folks start trying to mess			with my inherent right as an			artist, that's when I get mad.  No			one, in any way, shape or form			should be censored.				GARY BYRD			No matter how sexist or racist the			material may be?				DELACROIX			Yes.  And I say yes because who is			to judge?  Who is to stand before			us and say this is righteous and			this is not?  Who?  Who can play God?				GARY BYRD			But the line has to be drawn.				DELACROIX			Don't you people get it?  We're in			the 21st Century.  Slavery was over			four hundred years ago.  All that			stuff people talked in the old			days, it's over.  Folks always			crying, white man this, white man			that.  Let's all grow up.				GARY BYRD			Are you trying to excuse our			Holocaust?				DELACROIX			Can I finish?  Thank you.  I had a			great Aunt, we called her Sister.			She went to her grave not believing			man had walked on the Moon.				(MORE)										  92.				DELACROIX (CONT'D)			When I was a little kid, I would			argue with her, "it's on TV."  She			would answer "I don't care what's			on that idiot box.  No MAN is on			the MOON."  Well, there are a lot			of your Negroes just like my Aunt			Sister.  Face up to it.  The world			has changed and if you don't adapt,			change with it, you will be left			behind.  This show is a parody.

You			could have chosen Mike Wallace,			Barbara Walters, Jane Pauley,			whatnot but you're here.				MANTAN			I'm more comfortable around my			people.				TAVIS SMILEY			Let's jump right into it.  Your			show has sparked a world of			controversy, provoked a tone of			dialogue.  How do you see all of			this?				MANTAN			Yo, Tavis, check it out.  This is			the two-one, the 21st century and			it's all about the money.  Like my			man Mase says, "it's all about the			Benjamins."										 110.				TAVIS SMILEY			Money and nothing else?

That's what a lot of Negroes don't			understand.  Protesting isn't gonna			do a damn thing.  If people don't			like our satire in our number one			hit show then don't watch it.  Or			better yet write your own show.  Do			it better.				TAVIS SMILEY			Don't you feel that is a simplistic			retort?				MANTAN			I don't know what a retort is, but			it's simple.  Mantan - The New			Millennium Minstrel Show is			UNIVERSAL.  It's not just for			Negroes in Compton or 125th in			Harlem.  This is America.  Our			ancestors helped build this country,			we got a right, just like everybody			else.  I'm not gonna box myself in.			This show makes people think, and			they're laughing at the same time.
