CUT - to indicate time lapses within a scene   INT. DETMER RESIDENCE - ANDREW'S ROOM   The room is dingy. Unkempt. The camera sits on the bed, on   its side, facing the door. We can hear someone moving around   off screen.   The door handle clicks; someone's trying it.    Then nothing.   Then, suddenly, loud pounding on the door.   Andrew's voice is scratchy and prone to cracking.   He speaks   with a rushed mix of fear and anxiety.                    ANDREW (O.S.)          What do you want, I'm getting ready          for school-                    MR. DETMER (O.S.)          Why is the door locked, unlock this          fucking door right now.   The bed stirs as Andrew sits down.                    MR. DETMER (O.S.) (CONT'D)          I said unlock this door. UNLOCK          THE DOOR. OPEN THE DOOR, NOW.                    ANDREW (O.S.)          You're drunk-                     MR. DETMER (O.S.)          Listen, you don't tell me- IF I'M          DRUNK, OR-                    ANDREW (O.S.)          It's seven thirty. In the AM.          You're drunk, dad, that's crazy-                    MR. DETMER (O.S.)          What're you doing in there.                    ANDREW (O.S.)          I'm filming this.                    MR. DETMER (O.S.)          What?                    ANDREW (O.S.)          I bought a camera. I'm filming all          your shit from now on.                                                         2.   There's a beat, and then we can hear Mr. Detmer moving away   from the door.   INT. DETMER RESIDENCE - SANDRA DETMER'S ROOM   Equally dingy. SANDRA DETMER, gaunt and sickly, is sat up in   bed. Andrew's filming her. She's clearly very ill, speaking   in a weak rasp. Andrew now holds the camera.                   ANDREW (O.S.)          Mom? Will you say hi to the          camera?                    SANDRA DETMER          Who's the audience?                    ANDREW (O.S.)          The millions of people watching at          home.                    SANDRA DETMER          Hello world. Do I look awful?                    ANDREW (O.S.)          No, you look great.                    SANDRA DETMER          I've been looking a little better,          yeah?                    ANDREW (O.S.)          Oh yeah, definitely.                    SANDRA DETMER          It's a nice camera.   EXT. CLARK STREET - MORNING   Clark Street is a slummy mess; dead lawns, potholes in the   street in a downtrodden suburb of Portland Oregon. Andrew   carries the camera loosely at his side before getting into   the passenger side of a car.   In the driver's seat is MATT Garrety, 17, with messy hair.   He's disaffected, and more than a little cynical; the   reasoned demeanor of an unpretentious high-school   intellectual.                    MATT          I got you egg salad.                                                    3.                    ANDREW (O.S.)          Oh, yeah, thanks.                                                 CUT.  They're driving.                    MATT          So...Should I ask about the camera,          or-                    ANDREW (O.S.)          I'm filming things now. I'm          filming everything.                    MATT          You're filming everything.                    ANDREW (O.S.)          For my mom. I'm trying to get          custody of her from my dad. She's          getting worse, and he's          not...helping, and this way, in          case something goes down-                    MATT          He gets violent or whatever-                    ANDREW (O.S.)          Right, it'd be evidence.                    MATT          Evidence. But you're not with him          right now, but you're filming this.                    ANDREW (O.S.)          Well, yeah, to add context.                     MATT          Context.   Andrew, you are...a weird          dude.                                                 CUT.                    MATT (CONT'D)          Did you ever read any Auguste          Comte?                    ANDREW (O.S.)          What is that?                    MATT          He's this philosopher I'm reading.                                                            4.                    ANDREW (O.S.)          For school?                    MATT          He's just like- his whole thing is          about being positive and like,          taking up for yourself. You should          read him, maybe, it might make you          feel- you know, improve your          outlook.                    ANDREW (O.S.)          Yeah, right.EXT. BENJAMIN FRANKLIN HIGH - PARKING LOTAndrew's getting out of the car, but then ducks back in tosee Matt lighting a pipe.                    ANDREW (O.S.)          Are you not coming in?                    MATT          I'm gonna blaze a little first,          yeah?                    ANDREW (O.S.)          You're going to miss first period-Matt turns on the radio, loud.                    ANDREW (O.S.) (CONT'D)          Okay, okay.INT.

This is my school, I guess.   This          is the hallway-                    GIRL          Vote "Kaz!"A girl suddenly approaches, awkwardly handing Andrew a flyer.

Andrew backs up, shocked,lowering the camera.EXT. HAVEN HILLS FARM - EDGE OF THE WOODSAndrew's out alone in a field now, furiously cleaning thelens of the camera, obstructing our view.

Everybody knows who you are.                    STEVE          Haha, yes, that is true. Listen,          come on, bring the camera.                     ANDREW (O.S.)          What?   I don't-                     STEVE          Come on.Steve starts off, but Andrew hesitates.                     ANDREW (O.S.)

It's rather dark.                    ANDREW (O.S.)          Look, I don't think we're supposed          to-                    STEVE          Is there a light on that?   On your          camera?                    ANDREW (O.S.)          Oh, I don't- Hm, I don't know-The camera goes down for a moment while Andrew futzes withit. The light clicks on, illuminating Steve.                     STEVE          Awesome.

ANDREW (O.S.)          What were you guys doing out here?          This is way out-                    STEVE          Me and your cousin were blazing a          little.                    ANDREW (O.S.)          Matt's out here?                    STEVE          A bunch of people were out here,          but I think they've all gone back,          now, cause we're like, obsessed          with the thing.                      ANDREW (O.S.)          The what?                                                     CUT.They're in the woods now, thick and dizzying.

I          remember you from homeroom,          Freshman year.                    ANDREW (O.S.)          You remember that?                    STEVE          Yeah, I have a memory for faces.          I'm gonna go into politics, which          is ironic because I'm soooo fucking          high right now- probably shouldn't          be letting you videotape this-                    ANDREW (O.S.)          I'm gonna be so rich when you're          president, you have no idea-                    STEVE          Yeah, video footage of me luring          you into the woods for gay sex-          wait, hey- HEY, MATT, IS THIS IT?                                                        14.                       MATT (O.S.)          Down here!                       ANDREW (O.S.)          Matt?The camera turns to reveal Matt, standing next to some kindof craggy hole in the ground, at the base of a hill in thewoods. It's big, but the darkness beyond is impenetrable tothe camera. It looks like a big black spot.                    STEVE          There we go. There it is.

Where is everybody?                    MATT          They all left.                    ANDREW (O.S.)          We're not supposed to be out here.                    STEVE          Is it still making the sound?                     MATT          Yeah.   Did you tell Andrew?                    STEVE          Oh, Andrew, it's making a sound-                    MATT          Here, listen.                       ANDREW (O.S.)          Guys-                    STEVE          You've got to get really close to          hear it.Andrew takes a tentative step towards the hole.                    ANDREW (O.S.)          Guys, just don't like- don't push          me, or do anything like that-                                                         15.                    STEVE (O.S.)          You've got to go closer.     Like          almost inside it.There's a beat.                    MATT          We're not going to push you, we          just wanna get it on tape.Another pause. Andrew moves towards the hole. Even withNightvision, it's completely dark in there. A beat.                    STEVE (O.S.)          Do you hear it?                    ANDREW (O.S.)          ...It's like, whispering?                       STEVE (O.S.)          Listen.                       ANDREW (O.S.)          Singing?         MATT (O.S.)                       STEVE (O.S.)Ooooh shiiiiit-                   That is so fucking creepy!Andrew turns the camera back to Matt and Steve.                    ANDREW (O.S.) (CONT'D)          What is that?                    STEVE          We didn't dig the hole, man.                    MATT          Is the sound on the camera?                    ANDREW (O.S.)          I don't know, probably...I mean,          it's- it's kinda loud, right?Matt looks to Steve.                    STEVE          Do you guys wanna go in and have a          look, or what-                    ANDREW (O.S.)          No, I don't- I mean, I won't do th-                    STEVE          Hold your nose.                                                          16.Steve suddenly goes right into the hole, vanishing into thedarkness.

MATT          Steve, come on, we don't know if          it's stable in there- It's probably          just the wind, we should-Andrew abruptly goes into the cave.                    MATT (O.S.)

The camerasearches around, but the walls are tight in here, and low.                       ANDREW (O.S.)          Hello-             STEVE                        ANDREW (O.S.)   (suddenly appearing)           Aah!I'm right here.                    ANDREW (O.S.) (CONT'D)          Does it go down much deeper, or-                    STEVE          Yeah, really far. It's not a cave,          it's like a tunnel- do you hear how          loud that's getting?                    ANDREW (O.S.)          Do you think it could be like wind,          or-                    STEVE          Come on, man. Come on.                    ANDREW (O.S.)          Then what do you think it is?                                                         17.                   STEVE          Huh. I dunno. I don't believe in          ghosts.                    ANDREW (O.S.)          Who said anything about ghosts.Steve laughs, and turns, going back into the darkness.Andrew follows.                                                     CUT.Matt's face is suddenly in front of the camera.                    MATT          -shouldn't have come in here.                    ANDREW (O.S.)          Steve's up ahead-                     MATT          At first I thought this was a          solutional cave, but now...I dunno,          it's like a lava tube, or          something.                    ANDREW (O.S.)          I don't know what you're talking          about.                    MATT          Look at the walls. Look at how          smooth they are. It's just          straight shot down, I mean, we          must've already gone forty or fifty          feet-                    ANDREW (O.S.)          Don't talk about it, you're making          me nervous.                    MATT          You ever hear of Plato's allegory          of the cave?                       ANDREW (O.S.)          No.                       MATT          Nevermind.                                                     CUT.                                                           18.Walking. Darkness. The cave is even tighter now. The lightflickers, some kind of electrical disturbance, then goes outcompletely We hear Andrew curse, fumbling with it, and thenightvision mode comes on.                                                      CUT.The nightvision is scrambling badly.   All the forms aredistorted and then-                    STEVE (O.S.)          Can you believe this, this is NUTS-The nightvision is turned off, revealing Matt. They've comeinto a larger chamber in the cave, one somehow lit fromwithin; the boys are bathed in a softly pulsing turquoiseglow.They speak loudly, clearly talking over something we can'thear.                    MATT          Is that, is that showing up on the          camera?                    ANDREW (O.S.)          I don't wanna film it, it's messing          with the camera-Matt forcibly turns the camera, to reveal Steve standing nextto some kind of massive crystalline rock structure growingfrom, or maybe embedded in, the wall. Around it, and him,float wispy little clouds of light, turquoise and beautiful.Steve is clearly entranced, sweeping his hands through thelight.                       STEVE          Touch one!We see Matt, now also surrounded by the little auroraborealis like clouds, touch one; it comes apart in a silentlittle explosion of light, beautiful.                    ANDREW (O.S.)          Guys maybe...maybe we shouldn't...A light cloud passes in front of Andrew, and we sees his handto extend to touch it. The subsequent little light burstbadly warps the camera, clearly permanent damage.                                                      CUT.                                                           19.Andrew is now very near to the crystalline structure; viewedup close, it's almost arachnid, organic somehow. The lightclouds have turned yellow. Matt is practically inside thestructure, pressing it with his palms.                    MATT          -changes color, see? It must be          reacting to the heat, some kind of          exothermic reaction-                    ANDREW (O.S.)          WHAT? I can't hear you over the-          you know-                    STEVE          Make it change again!    This is          awesome!Matt presses with his palms. There's a low sustained hiss asthe light clouds turn an angry shade of red. A stream ofthem is released from beneath the structure. The camerajerks suddenly, revealing Steve, who's clutching his ears.                     STEVE (CONT'D)          AGHHHHH!Blood has begun to rapidly pour out of his eyes, ears, mouthand nose, and he buckles forwards; the camera spins wildlyand we see Matt seemingly FLUNG out of the crystallinestructure.It pulses, and seems to rapidly blossom and spread apart,revealing a blinding light within which EXPLODES OUTWARD; wecan suddenly hear an OVERWHELMING CHOIR OF VOICES, and thecamera sent rocketing backwards, flipping backwards up thetunnel-                                             CRACK.

MATT'S BACKYARD - AFTERNOONThe camera turns on; from the quality of the picture, it'simmediately evident that this is a newer, better camera.It's on a tripod, and Matt stands across a well manicuredbackyard; his hair is a little different, time has passed.                                                        20.                     MATT          Ready?                    ANDREW (O.S.)          Rolling, yeah.                    MATT          Okay, ball test.   Take one.A baseball comes flying in from behind the camera, nailingMatt in the face; he drops like a rock.                     MATT (CONT'D)          OW FUCK! WHAT THE FUCK STEVE!          UNDERHAND!Steve comes in from off camera to help Matt, laughing; we canhear Andrew laughing behind the camera, too.                    STEVE          I'm sorry, oh shit, I'm sorry-                                                     CUT.Now it's Steve who stands on the yard.                     STEVE (CONT'D)          Go.A baseball comes in from off camera, slower. It comes downtowards Steve, but at the last second makes a bizarre,impossible course correction, FLIES UP AND HITS STEVE IN THEFACE.                     STEVE (CONT'D)          AGH!   HEY, MATT, NOT COOL!Matt rushes on, doing a victory lap, one hand holding an ice-pack to his face. Again, we hear Andrew laughing.                    MATT          WE ARRREEE THE CHAAAMPIONS-                                                     CUT.Andrew's out across the yard. He looks a little better; he'sgotten rid of the ridiculous nerd beard, and his hair is alittle better kept. He nods.In flies the baseball. It abruptly stops in the air, a footand a half from Andrew's face. Steve and Matt let out acheer, and the camera is yanked off the tripod, taken to showa closer view of the impossibly suspended baseball andAndrew.                                                         21.Andrew smiles, and points to the suspended ball.   A trickleof blood comes out of his nose.                      ANDREW          Ah, shit.                                                      CUT.The camera's on a tripod up on the back porch, filmingAndrew, Steve and Matt standing a triangle. They are playingcatch...no hands. The ball simply flies from guy to guy.They drop it a few times in some cuts, but shoutencouragement, and are clearly having a good time.Finally, they get the ball going EXTREMELY fast.   Matt looksup.                      MATT          Is-Matt gets nailed in the balls, and drops as Steve and Andrewrush to him, laughing.                    STEVE          `In the- penis- the penis-                    MATT          I thought I heard my dad...UGHHH          WHY ME AGAAAAIN!?INT. MATT'S KITCHENSteve is very intently using his newfound powers to make apeanut butter and jelly sandwich, knife shakily moving overbread. The camera is set down on the counter, Matt andAndrew watching.                    ANDREW          The trick is to pretend like it's          on a plate. You get it on the          plate and then you wrap the plate          around it, and you can move it          however you want.                      STEVE          Mhm.                    MATT          I've been pretending I was like,          holding it in a fist, like a          floating hand.                                                          22.                     ANDREW          Yeah?   Plate's easier for me.                    STEVE          Guys, check it out.Steve has a glob of jelly and a glob of peanut butterfloating freely. They slap together and then down onto thebread, which slaps closed.                     STEVE (CONT'D)          Ha!              (notices his bloody nose)          Shit, shit-INT. MATT'S ROOM - LATERMatt's room is covered in band posters, kind of a mess.Matt's sitting on the floor by a desk, slowly assembling aLEGO set with his telekinetic abilities.

I told you, it's just my thing for          right now.                    STEVE          You don't feel like it's a little          weird?

He got injured          like two years ago, and now they          just pay him out of, like,          insurance. He doesn't do anything,          I mean he goes out during the day,          but I don't know where. He drinks          a lot.

My mom has spinal meningitis, she's-          she can't work or anything, and the          insurance doesn't cover all of her          medicine, so a lot of my money has          to go into that. I figure if I get          enough on camera, maybe I can, I          dunno, get custody of her or          something.Steve mulls this over.

ANDREW              (long beat)          I'm an idiot. I'm sorry Steve, oh          god, I'm sorry-                    STEVE          Dude, it's okay.

Andrew's camera movements are rigid again, tight andconfined, back to how they were when we first started.We see Steve's mother and father. His mother is sobbing.His father simply looks shellshocked, staring at the casket.Steve's mother leans on his father, and he pushes her away.There's Samantha, crying uncontrollably. The camera passesMatt...Who's staring directly at us.                                                       CUT.Andrew walks along in the cemetary, filming tombstones.                     MATT (O.S.)           What are you doing? Filming           graves, I don't get it.The camera looks up at Matt.    He's keeping his distance.                     MATT (CONT'D)           You're not returning my calls, why           aren't you returning my calls.                     ANDREW (O.S.)           I've been busy.                     MATT           No you haven't. Why aren't you           returning my calls. Turn off the           camera.

I was upset.                                                60.

And they find          him out in a field, why would Steve          go out in the middle of a field          during a lightning storm?The camera shifts a little.                    ANDREW (O.S.)          I don't know-                     MATT          What?                    ANDREW (O.S.)

I'm not lying, I don't know what          happened-                    MATT          I don't believe you, okay! I don't          believe you, I want you to- put the          fucking camera down.                     ANDREW (O.S.)          No, why-                    MATT          Because I want to talk to you.

He's suddenly shoved backwards; Mattrecovers himself before he falls, staring at Andrew. Thecamera hangs limply for a moment.                    MATT (CONT'D)              (breaking down a little)          What did you do, Andrew? What am I          supposed to do? Who am I supposed          to tell, about this, man? Who do I          tell? I mean- I don't, I don't          know how I'm supposed to- Why won't          you just tell me what happened?The camera and Andrew suddenly launch into the air, rocketingaway from Matt.INT. DETMER RESIDENCE - ANDREW'S ROOMThe camera is on Andrew's dresser, near his mirror.   Andrewsuddenly appears, holding a kitchen knife.                    ANDREW              (addressing the camera)          -wanted to show you what I was          talking about.Andrew takes the camera, and angles it down at his arm. Hetakes the kitchen knife, and presses the tip into the fleshof his wrist. He drags the blade down hard, all the way tohis elbow...but no cut appears. He then violently jabshimself several times...but no penetration.                    ANDREW (CONT'D)          See, it's- I put a little sheet          between myself and the knife, and          the barrier, the sheet, is too          strong. The knife can't cut it. I          mean like, what I'm saying is if I          concentrate, I can't be hurt. I          can't be injured. Because of the          little sheet.EXT. BENJAMIN FRANKLIN HIGH - FOOTBALL FIELDAndrew sits alone on the bleachers. The cheerleaders arepracticing. The camera zooms in on Samantha. She sits aloneon the sidelines, watching numbly.                                                        62.INT. BENJAMIN FRANKLIN HIGH - HALLWAYAndrew is putting his stuff away in his locker.

Hey Wayne!                    WAYNE          What, you got a probl-One of Andrew's hands flicks out, and Wayne's mouth suddenlygushes blood. Wayne screams, falling, and is immediatelytended to by other students.INT. BENJAMIN FRANKLIN HIGH - BATHROOM STALLAndrew has laid out three small bloody objects on the back ofthe toilet, and presents each one to the camera one by one.They're Wayne's bloody teeth.                    ANDREW (O.S.)          See, this one, I got clean, cause I          did a little lasso around the root,          but these two, they're broken cause          I think I pulled them from the          middle. Matt was always better at          the little, the intricate stuff, he          got good at that. See how broken          it is, ugh, sloppy.INT. BENJAMIN FRANKLIN HIGH - GUIDANCE COUNSELOR'S OFFICEMike FERNANDEZ, 30s, serious but warm, sits across the deskfrom Andrew. The concern in his voice is very real.                    FERNANDEZ          Could you put the camera away?                    ANDREW (O.S.)          No, I'm filming this. I film          everything.                                                       63.                    FERNANDEZ          I understand that things have been          very hard for you recently, Andrew,          but the camera kind of- it          alienates a little, you know?                    ANDREW (O.S.)          What did you want to talk about?                     FERNANDEZ              (beat)          There's concern for your grades,          Andrew. And as far as I know          you've yet to apply to any          colleges, so-                    ANDREW (O.S.)          It's not doable. Financially,          they're not- I mean, my dad didn't          go to college either.                    FERNANDEZ          Well, yes, but I still think it's          worth thinking about. There are          three different community colleges          locally that offer great programs          for-                     ANDREW (O.S.)          I don't need college, Mr.          Fernandez.                     FERNANDEZ              (beat)          I think that's a very close-minded          attitude, Andrew. I know that you          come from a difficult background,          and I know how horrible the pain          can be when you lose a friend. But          I don't think you should let this          make you lose hope. I mean, this          is your future. You don't want to          compromise your future.

Thecamera turns to face Andrew. He doesn't look good, but givesa weak smile.INT. DETMER RESIDENCE - MS. DETMER'S ROOMWe're peeking in through the door. We can see Sandra Detmerwrithing around in agony in the bed, moaning in pain. Shelets out a long scream, and then seems to notice us watching.                    SANDRA DETMER          Richard is that you? Richard, you          have to let me have my medicine, I          can't...Andrew? Who is that?          Look, please come in here, I need          help to turn over. It hurts,          please, Andrew, you have to tell          your father...tell your father to          get my medicine...Sandra, her eyes closed in pain, is lifted and rolled ontoher side.

The camera sits awkwardly on the hood of awrecked car as Andrew fidgets to get it mounted. The area islit by lights from the main building, not too far away, butyou can tell he's not supposed to be in here.

ANDREW          I've been doing a lot of reading,          like you know, online, about          evolution, and the way it works,          and you know, natural selection.          The uh...               (cut)          The strongest animals will always          survive, and they're the ones that          you know, will prosper, or grow,          and survive, by feeding on the          smaller animals. And as humans we-          see, there's...uh-               (cut)          There's this thing called an Apex          Predator, and basically what that          is the most powerful predator in an          ecosystem. And humans, you know,          we're the apex predator, because          there's nothing that preys on us,          cause of weapons and stuff. But if          something could, I bet it would.          I...               (cut)          I mean, what I'm trying to say is,          a lion doesn't feel guilty when it          kills a gazelle. You don't feel          guilty when you squash a fly, you          know- I think that means          something. I think it really means          something.                                                      CUT.Andrew's back out with the car. He lifts it again, thenmakes a quick "squeezing" motion. As he does this, the carviolently compresses down to the size of a basketball.Andrew flings the ball of metal into a scrap pile, whichcollapses loudly.Andrew falls down onto his butt, a little exhausted, but ashe gets up he is abruptly attacked by a guard dog, whichbites him twice before he's able to fling it off.The dog recovers, and rushes Andrew, who raises a hand,blasting the dog across the yard, killing it instantly.Andrew turns and looks at the camera, and it turns off.FROM CASEY'S CAMERA.Everything is crisper, cleaner, brighter.

MATT          I am so sick of being filmed, you          have no idea, Casey-                    CASEY (O.S.)          No I know, but I'm not going to use          any of this. I just want you to do          a trick, one of your good ones.                    MATT          When do your parents get back from          Spain?

BRING IT ON!Casey fires several more shots, Matt catches themeffortlessly, then hurls them all into the air. Mid-air,they all pop, some of the paint landing on the camera andCasey.

MATT          Ughhhh camera...I had that dream          again.                     CASEY (O.S.)          Tell me.                    MATT          It's like I'm...I'm not me, I'm          something else. And I'm out in          this...out in space. And stars are          all around me, and I'm zooming past          them; everything is really like          three-D, I can see the shape of the          stars. I'm looking for somewhere          to sleep, or something, and I see          earth, and I go down to earth. And          then...I don't know, just the main          part is that I'm out and there are          the stars and they just look like          millions of little points of          light...And Steve is there.                    CASEY (O.S.)          Steve is there?                    MATT          Yeah but he feels like he's not          part of it. Like he's there          separately, inside my head. Andrew          is there too. I don't know. I'm          worried about Andrew.              (beat, slyly)          Why don't you put the camera away?                    CASEY (O.S.)          Oh yeah? What's gonna happen to me          if I put the camera away-                    MATT          Oh I think you know. I think you          know what's going down.                    CASEY (O.S.)          We could leave the camera on.                                                          70.

Once his dad's car is gone,Andrew sets down the camera on the dresser opposite themirror, and leaves the room.Time passes, and Andrew reappears, now dragging a crate. Heopens it, and pulls out his father's fireman's uniform. Wedo short-space time cuts as he takes out the jacket, looks atit, and turns it inside out, so that the metallic fireproofinner lining is exposed."Ziggy Stardust" comes on Andrew's stereo.                                                        73.Andrew, wearing the jacket, looks at himself in the mirror,his back to the camera. He reaches down, and picks somethingup, looking at it, then pulls it over his head.It's a gas mask.He stands there staring at the surreal, hard edged, facelessfigure in the mirror. Looks right. Looks left. Adjusts themask.Then turns and whips out his hand; the camera is abruptlyyanked across the room.EXT. RUN-DOWN HOUSE - SUNSETIt's a run-down house in Andrew's neighborhood. Thestreetlights and the setting sun give everything light inyellow orange haze.Howard, Costly, and some other thugs are chilling on theporch, laughing loudly, smoking a blunt. They clearlyhaven't noticed Andrew, who's filming from out by the street.He reaches down, and picks up a rock, then hurls it at thehouse. It flies up and breaks a window. Costly, Howard andthe thugs immediately mobilize, swearing and posturing asthey rapidly surround Andrew.He doesn't react.                    HOWARD          You are about to get fucking          stomped, you know that right? You          hear me son?

What the          fuck are you dressed up like that          for. Are you high?                    HOWARD          Lil' Andrew's straight up tripping          right now, I don't even know, I'ma          give your ass a wake up call-Howard starts towards Andrew, who raises a hand out in frontof the camera. He makes the "gun sign."                                                           74.                    HOWARD (CONT'D)          Oh you got a gat? I got a gat too          bitch-Howard starts to pull a gun from the back of his pants.                    ANDREW (O.S.)              (firing the finger gun)          Bang.Howard's body abruptly FOLDS BACKWARDS with a sickly loudchorus of cracks, and then is FLUNG ASIDE. The thugs,shocked, don't have a second to react before Andrewtelekinetically BLOWS ONE OF THEM BACKWARDS, sending himsmashing headfirst through the windshield of his car.Costly and the remaining thug start running, and theremaining thugs legs suddenly flip up out from under him,breaking, bending and twisting like a rag doll, before he'spropelled face first into the ground, WHAM.Andrew launches into the air, coming down just in front ofCostly, who skids to a halt.                     COSTLY          -no, no-Costly is shoved to the street and ground back and forth asthough under the weight of a giant thumb, leaving aglistening smear of clothes, blood and skin, before he fallsacross the curb.We can hear the men screaming and groaning in agony, butother than that, the night is silent.Andrew raises a hand, and all of their wallets and loosemoney lift away from them, flying to him. There's a beat,and then Andrew launches into the air.EXT. RADIOTOWER - 80 FEET UP - TWILIGHTAndrew sits under one of the red airplane spotter lights onone of the strut supports. The camera sits nearby, watchingthe expressionless figure as it counts the money.There's a beat and he hangs his head. We can hear mufflednoises of frustration from under the mask. Something thatsounds like a low, angry scream.Very suddenly, he dives off the tower. A second later, thecamera is yanked after him, zooming out into freefall.                                                          75.EXT. GAS STATIONAndrew, holding the camera, touches down just outside the gasstation. He waits a beat, and then starts to walk towardsit. We transition to...FROM GAS STATION SECURITY CAMERAS.Black and white, a slightly grainy feed, with no audio.We watch from the camera by the pumps as the bizarre figurein the coat and the gas mask, holding the camera out in frontof it, strides past people pumping gas, into the stationstore.INT. GAS STATIONThe wall mounted security camera shows us the whole store.Andrew enters, turning to the clerk behind the register, whosays something, looking concerned. He's suddenly blown outof frame.After a beat, the register rips itself free from the counter,and floats over to Andrew.Andrew turns and walks out, the register floating with him;as he does, a second clerk rushes out, panicked, yelling. Hegoes behind the counter, and grabs a shotgun.EXT. GAS STATIONAndrew exits the gas station, as does the clerk, who yells,raising the shotgun.Andrew whips an arm out towards him, and the clerk fires ashe's hit by a wave of energy. The shotgun blast goes wild,striking the stacked tanks of propane next to the garage.The effect is instantaneous; a blinding white flash of fireenvelopes the clerk and floors Andrew, the camera we lookthrough jerking awkwardly, the feed breaking down.FROM ANDREW'S SECOND CAMERA.The camera lays awkwardly on its side, the distorted audiofrom its damaged microphone SUDDEN AND PIERCING.It's been flung a good deal away from Andrew, who laysmotionless, burning.                                                       76.The clerk is dead, and a nearby gas station customer ishorribly injured and screaming. His gas pump lays on theground, pumping out gas onto the asphalt.Andrew slowly shifts, unable to move properly, and forceshimself to roll over. The fire on his body touches the fireon the asphalt, and spreads lightning fast to the gas pump.The resulting explosion engulfs the entire station.The camera is spun violently out into the street-                                                  VIOLENT                                           DISTORTION AND                                          CRASH TO BLACK.FROM SECURE ROOM VIDEO FEEDINT. HOSPITAL ROOMThe camera is color, with crackly, strange, somewhatdistorted audio. The image is a little blown out.Andrew on a bed. His entire right side is absolutelyscorched; the flesh looks like bloody, cracked paper,blackened and red. The parts of him that are bandaged arealready soaked through with blood.He is barely breathing, hooked up to various machines.Andrew is not going anywhere anytime soon. This is ensuredby the handcuff on his left wrist.The machines beep. Andrew doesn't move. The door opens, andMr. Detmer enters, speaking to a POLICE DETECTIVE on theother side of the door.                    MR.

DETMER          Okay.The officer closes the door, and Mr. Detmer goes and sitsdown in a chair next to the bed. He sits there staring atAndrew, clearly horrified and upset, and buries his head inhis hands. We SPEED UP THE RECORDING, and Detmer just sitslike that. After five minutes of speed up, we slow down.                    MR. DETMER (CONT'D)          I want you to apologize to me.Andrew is comatose.                    MR.

You          just don't give a fuck, you've got          your fucking morphine, don't you.There's a beat, and then Detmer suddenly slaps Andrew's burntshoulder. Andrew flinches badly, and his pulse speeds up onthe monitor.                     MR. DETMER (CONT'D)          Stop it. I'm not buying this shit,          you can't just play this off like a          fucking              (slap)          Game, this is real.

Detmer stands up, clearly upset, and takes aquick pace forward and back.                    MR. DETMER (CONT'D)          Goddamn it, goddamn it!-                                                           78.Detmer goes to slap Andrew again, and Andrew's arm jerks up.Mr. Detmer floats is telekinetically lifted into the air.He hangs screaming and struggling for a moment, then becomesrigid.Andrew spreads his fingers, and his father abruptly separatesinto all of his component parts.They stop moving, hanging lifeless, then drop to the groundin a bloody mess.Andrew's eyes open, revealing black-red eightballhemorrhages, and he seizes badly, letting out a scream ofagony, and then another, tearing at his IV.The police detectives rush the room, reacting with horror tothe gore that was Andrew's father. They barely have time toscream out when Andrew snaps his cuff free of the bed, andlets out AN ENORMOUS CONCUSSIVE BLAST, blowing aparteverything in the room including the camera.

CASEY (CONT'D)          Matt, it's not safe. It's not          safe. What's going on. What's          happening. Why are we doing this,          Matt, please. Please take me home.

We can hear sirens.Casey is filming out the window, everything looks normal,until there's a loud crash; then Casey swishes the camera toreveal that a police car, its siren still moaning, has landedon top of a newstand, apparently dropped from the sky.                                                         82.                    CASEY (CONT'D)          How- how is that possible, that's          not possible-There's an explosion from nearby and shattered glass rainsdown onto the car. Matt slams on the brakes, looking upthrough the windshield, searching the sky.                    MATT          Where are you, man?There's a beat, and then a police officer abruptly appears onthe passenger's side, next to Casey.                    POLICE OFFICER          Listen, you can't be here, I need          you to turn this car around right          now and-The police officer is yanked upwards, disappearing from sightfor a moment before coming crashing down thirty feet away.Casey screams.                    CASEY          What's...What is...What's...Matt          please, please-The car SUDDENLY ROCKETS INTO THE AIR, straight up, flippingend over end, past the tops of the buildings, and then comesto a stop, hanging at about two hundred feet. Casey'sbreathing is painfully short and sharp. Matt stares out intothe night sky.He flicks on the brights. There's Andrew, in his hospitalgown, floating a dozen feet out, his flesh charred andtwisted, his body clearly wracked with agonizing pain.A news helicopter circles past out of sight, and for amoment, Andrew is framed in the chopper's spotlight.His eyes flash to the car.                    ANDREW              (screaming)          WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE!?The windshield is TORN OUT, and seconds later MATT IS RIPPEDOUT OF THE CAR AS THOUGH YANKED BY A GIANT HOOK, taking hisseatbelt with him.

Casey's screams are barelyaudible over the rushing of the wind as the buildings rushpast outside, her camera frozen in place as she plummets toher death.And then suddenly, so suddenly it's completely disorienting,the side of the car bursts apart and we're flying, blurredviews of buildings, the sky, the side of some jeans...Stillness. Casey's camera is pointed down, showing heradidas...and Matt's high-tops.                    MATT (O.S.)          Stay here, okay? You have to stay          here.

Matt..what...                    MATT (O.S.)          Casey, I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.Matt's feet suddenly go out of frame.                       CASEY (O.S.)          Matt wait!     WAIT PLEASE!   MATT!NOTE: In the following sequence, everything is seen inglimpses and glances, never lingering too long on one thing.Much of what happens should be seen through implication,rather than direct effect.Everything happens very fast, and none of the cameras canfully keep track.FROM SEVERAL HELICAMS.The feed is crisp and clear, but without the satellite audio,meaning no narration from the reporter. There are severalchopper's flying at different distances from the action, andwe intercut as necessary.                                                        84.EXT. DOWNTOWN PORTLANDThe news chopper at first shows Casey's destroyed car layingin the street, then pans back up to show Andrew, who'sfloating hunched over, vomiting.Matt flies up behind him, and tries to help him, but Andrewshoves him away. We're too far away to hear anything that'ssaid.Matt tries again, and Andrew yells something. Matt, clearlyupset, replies. Andrew, talking fast and jerky, gesturestowards his burns. Matt tries to reply several times, butAndrew isn't hearing it. Matt smiles nervously at thedestruction, and says something gently.Andrew replies, and whatever is said here, it causes aradical shift in Matt's demeanor. He's no longer concerned;he seems repulsed. Andrew says more, clearly SCREAMING atMatt.Matt seems to beg Andrew for something and Andrew relents.Matt continues, more forcefully, and then notices somethingto his right. A BUS SMASHES HIM OUT OF THE AIR, SWATTING HIMLIKE A BUG INTO THE SIDE OF AN APARTMENT COMPLEX.Andrew suddenly turns, flailing an arm at us in the chopper;a mailbox comes CRASHING UP INTO THE CAMERA.FROM MICHAEL ERNESTO'S CAMERA.MICHAEL ERNESTO is, along with several other people from hisbuilding, out on his roof. He watches in horror as thehelicopter Andrew hit goes out of control, falling out offrame.Moments later, we hear the explosion as it crashes.                    MICHAEL ERNESTO (O.S.)          Oh, oh no, those people, man, those          people, oh god-                    ERNESTO'S NEIGHBOR (O.S.)          Where's the other guy?                    MICHAEL ERNESTO (O.S.)          He's fucking dead man, you saw- oh          shit oh shit-Andrew comes toppling down out of the sky like a woundedbird, crashing into the roof. He vomits again, mostly bile;everyone around him is in shock, frozen, as he screams inpain and rolls over.                                                        85.He's bleeding badly from the nose and ears.                    ANDREW              (agonized, crying)          No one's gonna help me...No one's          gonna help me now...We get some shots from other people's cameras, video phones,etc on the roof. Some people scream and try to run pastAndrew, and he blasts them off the roof like bowling pins,which leads to more screaming.Andrew stands shakily, looking directly at Michael Ernesto.                    MICHAEL ERNESTO (O.S.)          Please man, please, I don't know          you man-                    ANDREW              (mumbled)          What type of camera is that?                    MICHAEL ERNESTO (O.S.)              (breaking down)          What? I don't know, I don't know          you man, I didn't- please okay,          please-Andrew starts to raise an arm, when he's suddenly NAILED BYMATT, blasting by at well over eighty miles an hour.FROM BANK SECURITY CAMERA.The inside of the bank is quiet and peaceful, when MATT ANDANDREW COME CRASHING THROUGH THE ROOF.FROM POLICE CAR DASHBOARD CAM.The police car rockets up the street, but has to screech to ahalt when MATT AND ANDREW COME EXPLODING OUT OF THE FRONT OFTHE BANK.The two of them brawl in the street for a moment; it's notimpressive martial arts, or even super powered, just two guysfighting for their lives. Matt gets the upperhand, deckingAndrew and driving him to the ground, and suddenly the copcar (our POV), lifts off.WE GO FLYING INTO MATT, crashing out the camera as he turnsand creates a telekinetic wall.                                                        86.FROM CALA PRENTI'S CAMERA.CALA, filming from her apartment window, watches in shock andhorror as the police car, carried by its momentum, is sentFLIPPING INTO THE AIR, and we glimpse it as it passes herwindow, lights still flaring.Her sister rushes up, looking out the window.

Andrew flies low, and Matt gives chase.Andrew turns, beginning to telekinetically lob everything atstreet level at Matt; traffic lights, parking meters, trees,etc......But Matt's too good a flyer. What he doesn't block hesimply dips and weaves around. Andrew, clearly still woozy,is distracted and smashes into a street-light, wiping out onthe asphalt.                    CAMERA-MAN          They're down. One of them just          went down. Jesus christ.Matt slowly lands nearby. The camera zooms in and hits themboth with a spotlight, causing Matt to shield his eyes andlook up, scared, as Andrew struggles to stand.We get a good look at the toll this is taking on him; Matt'sface is a crimson mask of blood from his nose, eyes, mouthand ears. He's limping badly, his clothes torn, visiblycovered with injuries. He looks like he's been in a carwreck.                    CAMERA-MAN (CONT'D)          Oh shit, look at him.                                                         87.He approaches Andrew, talking again, more fervently. Andrewjust shakes his head, falling repeatedly as he tries tostand, like a wounded dog.Two cop cars skid to a halt nearby, the officers unloadingand taking cover. One of them advances on Matt and Andrew,gun raised. Matt goes out in front of Andrew, protective,pleading, raising his hands.The cop is clearly panicked. He fires a shot.    Matt's armwhips out, impossible fast; he buckles and screams in pain,holding his hand, which is gushing blood.

Shawn-Something around the corner explodes, and Matt comes flyingpast overhead, slightly on fire, before Andrew comes lungingat Matt, catching him, twisting out and over the camera man,SLAMMING HIM INTO THE SIDE OF A SKYSCRAPER ON THE STREET.Andrew lifts Matt up high into the air, scraping him againstbuildings on either side of the street, bouncing like apinball until-                                                           88.FROM ABC 5'S HELICAM.-Matt struggles, and there's a visible ripple in the air; amassive concussive burst, sending both of them rocketingdownwards as though shot out of a cannon.They strike the massive bronze statue of "Portlandia," atrident wielding demigoddess, in front of the Michael Gravesbuilding, uprooting it from its pedestal before crashing tothe ground.Matt's body accordions brutally when he lands, and he flopsdown at a broken, dead angle. Andrew lands nearly as badly,lays still for a moment, and then begins twitching andscreaming when the chopper's spotlight hits him.FROM MICHAEL GRAVES' BUILDING EXTERIOR SECURITY CAMERAThe statue of Portlandia lays awkwardly in the street.Andrew writhes. Matt is motionless, blood pooling aroundhim, his back broken.FROM POLICE DASHBOARD CAMS, HELICOPTER CAMERAS, HANDHELDSFROM WINDOWS, EVERYTHING.A bunch of squad cars and emergency units converge around thefront of the Michael Graves building and downed statue.

We're with them as they approach;the mood is of barely controlled panic, officers shoutingback and forth to each other.Andrew and Matt are polka-dotted by red-laser sight dots.Andrew suddenly stands up, and several officers fire; thebullets spark off an invisible barrier in front of him, andhe shakily raises both hands.The all of the police officers, firemen and paramedics aretelekinetically lifted into the air.They hang struggling for a moment, and then all of theirlimbs go rigid. We've seen this before.Andrew screams, and then...It all happens in under twoseconds:                                                         89.Matt swings an arm, blinding fast; the triton wielding arm ofPortlandia bends jaggedly, bringing down the pitchfork hard,first through Andrew, then into the pavement.Andrew stands impaled, a look of shock on his face, and thenMatt flails up his hand; the bullet lodged inside fires out,striking Andrew in the head, killing him instantly.All of the floating people drop, dazed.Matt collapses.   After a moment, the police advance.                                              CUT TO BLACK.FROM CLEAN ROOM CAMS.The clean room cams are incredibly hi-def, crisp and clear,with all manner of data and time codes scrolling all over thetop and bottom of the screens.Matt lays on the floor of a perfectly white room. At the farend is a blackened out two way mirror. There's a camera onthe inside of this too, and we can see resolute men in suitsreflected on the inner glass, watching with unreadableexpressions.There is a chair and a table, but he's clearly fallen out ofthe chair. It's maybe an hour after the scene in front ofthe Michael Graves building, and he's received no medicalattention.To this end, Matt is suffering from, among other things,massive blood-loss, multiple broken bones, dozens of gashesand cuts, presumed internal bleeding, and a broken back.He can barely move, sliding around on the floor in his ownblood as he dies, watched by the compassionless eyes of thecameras.He is barely coherent, screeching in agony.                    MATT          Please...Help me. Help me, HELP ME,          please...I'm sorry! I'm so sorry,          I tried- help me, help me, I'm          dying, I'm dying. Stars- I see          stars, somebody- It hurts, please.          I'm- the blood...I tried...Two men in contamination suits enter the room, wielding somekind of radiation sensors. They go over to Matt, scanninghim.                                                          90.                    MATT (CONT'D)          Listen, help me, help me. I'm          dying, you have to help me, don't          just let me- PLEASE I'M SORRY! I'm          SORRY! HELP ME! I-The men ignore him as Matt makes some gasping sounds, hiseyes going wide.                    MATT (CONT'D)          I can...I can hear the singing.Matt entirely stops moving.   He lays there, not breathing,completely still.And then suddenly the two men are flung backwards, as is thetable and the chair. There are a series of grotesque poppingand snapping sounds from Matt's body, and he jerks, andwrithes, pushing himself up onto his hands and knees.The security cams track and zoom, and as Matt stands, werealize a startling truth: his cuts are closing themselves.His broken bones have already molded back into place. Hisbruises are shrinking away to nothing.The blacked out glass suddenly shatters, and falls out of itsframe, revealing a shocked, frightened room of high rankingmilitary personnel, along with several men in civilianclothes.Matt stares at them.   They stare back at him.                    4-STAR GENERAL              (terrified)          Listen...Son, you don't- I mean...Matt raises a finger to his lips, and the general trails off.Matt smile weakly for a moment, then stops.                    MATT          Would you please...turn off the          fucking cameras.                                               CUT TO BLACK.

Kim yells in fear. The crack widens, anenormous tidal gush of water bursts through, gushing down theside of the hills into the valley.Kim's father embraces him, and they have a brief exchange,when suddenly there's the sound of a sonic boom overhead.All around them people EXPLODE into cheers. It's not fear,but rather a kind of frantic ovation. The camera sweeps up,panning the empty blue sky excitedly, finally coming to restonMatt Garrety.Looking fucking great as he floats above the freeway. Hepantomimes "yeah, bring it on, cheer louder!" This gets theintended response, and he pumps a fist shouting "FUCK YEAHKOREA!"He turns, pretending to notice the oncoming flood for thefirst time, mouths "Oh shit!" Points at the flood casuallyas it closes in: "I should deal with this." Another hugeovation, and Matt smiles widely nods his head "yeahhhhhh!"and turns.There's a sonic boom as he goes from zero to mach 4 in lessthan a second, rattling the cars on the freeway, disappearinginto the distance over the flood.After a moment, the impossibly huge onrush of water seems tostop, slowing and freezing in place, and then...SLOWLY BEGINSTO REWIND TOWARDS THE DAM.The camera jerks around wildly as the crowd goes insane,embracing, kissing, screaming, jumping on their cars.
