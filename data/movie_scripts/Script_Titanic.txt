Now thebow swings down and the stern falls back level... but the weight of the bowpulls the stern up vertical, and then the bow section detaches, heading forthe bottom. The stern bobs like a cork, floods and goes under about 2:20a.m. Two hours and forty minutes after the collision.The animation then follows the bow section as it sinks.

It is lowered toward HATCH #2.On the pier horsedrawn vehicles, motorcars and lorries move slowly throughthe dense throng. The atmosphere is one of excitement and generalgiddiness. People embrace in tearful farewells, or wave and shout bonvoyage wishes to friends and relatives on the decks above.A white RENAULT, leading a silver-gray DAIMLER-BENZ, pushes through thecrowd leaving a wake in the press of people.

The Titanic ismonstrous.Fabrizio runs back and grabs Jack, and they sprint toward the third classgangway aft, at E deck.

She doesn't see Jackin the shadows, and runs right past him.TRACKING WITH ROSE as she runs across the deserted fantail. Her breathhitches in an occasional sob, which she suppresses. Rose slams against thebase of the stern flagpole and clings there, panting. She stares out at theblack water.Then starts to climb over the railing. She has to hitch her long dress wayup, and climbing is clumsy. Moving methodically she turns her body and getsher heels on the white-painted gunwale, her back to the railing, facing outtoward blackness. 60 feet below her, the massive propellers are churningthe atlantin into white foam, and a ghostly wake trails off toward thehorizon.IN A LOW ANGLE, we see Rose standing like a figurehead in reverse. Belowher are the huge letters of the name "TITANIC".She leans out, her arms straightening... looking down hypnotized, into thevortex below her. Her dress and hair are lifted by the wind of the ship'smovement. The only sound, above the rush of water below, is the flutter andsnap of the big Union Jack right above her.

ROSEWhat do you mean no I won't? Don't presume to tell me what I will and willnot do. You don't know me.                                   JACKYou would have done it already. Now come on, take my hand.Rose is confused now. She can't see him very well through the tears, so shewipes them with one hand, almost losing her balance.                                   ROSEYou're distracting me. Go away.                                   JACKI can't. I'm involved now. If you let go I have to jump in after you.                                   ROSEDon't be absurd. You'll be killed.He takes off his jacket.                                   JACKI'm a good swimmer.He starts unlacing his left shoe.                                   ROSEThe fall alone would kill you.                                   JACKIt would hurt. I'm not saying it wouldn't. To be honest I'm a lot moreconcerned about the water being so cold.She looks down. The reality factor of what she is doing is sinking in.                                   ROSEHow cold?                                   JACK                        (taking off his left shoe)Freezing. Maybe a couple degrees over.He starts unlacing his right shoe.

Once when I was a kid me and my father wereice-fishing out on Lake Wissota... ice-fishing's where you chop a hole inthe--                                   ROSEI know what ice fishing is!                                   JACKSorry. Just... you look like kind of an indoor girl. Anyway, I went throughsome thin ice and I'm tellin' ya, water that cold... like that right downthere... it hits you like a thousand knives all over your body. You can'tbreath, you can't think... least not about anything but the pain.                        (takes off his other shoe)Which is why I'm not looking forward to jumping in after you. But like Isaid, I don't see a choice. I guess I'm kinda hoping you'll come back overthe rail and get me off the hook here.                                   ROSEYou're crazy.                                   JACKThat's what everybody says. But with all due respect, I'm not the onehanging off the back of a ship.He slides one step closer, like moving up on a spooked horse.                                   JACKCome on. You don't want to do this. Give me your hand.Rose stares at this madman for a long time. She looks at his eyes and theysomehow suddenly seem to fill her universe.                                   ROSEAlright.She unfastens one hand from the rail and reaches it around toward him. Hereaches out to take it, firmly.                                   JACKI'm Jack Dawson.                                   ROSE                             (voice quavering)Pleased to meet you, Mr. Dawson.Rose starts to turn. Now that she has decided to live, the height isterrifying. She is overcome by vertigo as she shifts her footing, turningto face the ship. As she starts to climb, her dress gets in the way, andone foot slips off the edge of the deck.She plunges, letting out a piercing SHRIEK. Jack, gripping her hand, isjerked toward the rail. Rose barely grabs a lower rail with her free hand.QUARTERMASTER ROWE, up on the docking bridge hears the scream and heads forthe ladder.                                   ROSEHELP! HELP!!                                   JACKI've got you. I won't let go.Jack holds her hand with all his strength, bracing himself on the railingwith his other hand. Rose tries to get some kind of foothold on the smoothhull. Jack tries to lift her bodily over the railing. She can't get anyfooting in her dress and evening shoes, and she slips back. Rose SCREAMSagain.Jack, awkwardly clutching Rose by whatever he can get a grip on as sheflails, gets her over the railing. They fall together onto the deck in atangled heap, spinning in such a way that Jack winds up slightly on top ofher.Rowe slides down the ladder from the docking bridge like it's a fire drilland sprints across the fantail.                                   ROWEHere, what's all this?!Rowe runs up and pulls Jack off of Rose, revealing her dishevelled andsobbing on the deck. Her dress is torn, and the hem is pushing up above herknees, showing one ripped stocking. He looks at Jack, the shaggy steerageman with his jacket off, and the first class lady clearly in distress, andstarts drawing conclusions. Two seamen chug across the deck to join them.                                   ROWE                                 (to Jack)Here you, stand back! Don't move an inch!

Jack is being detained by the burly MASTER AT ARMS,the closest thing to a cop on board. He is handcuffing Jack. Cal is rightin front of Jack, and furious. He has obviously just rushed out here withLovejoy and another man, and none of them have coats over their black tieevening dress. The other man is COLONEL ARCHIBALD GRACIE, a mustachioedblowhard who still has his brandy snifter. He offers it to Rose, who ishunched over crying on a bench nearby, but she waves it away. Cal is moreconcerned with Jack. He grabs him by the lapels.                                    CALWhat made you think you could put your hands on my fiancee?! Look at me,you filth!

And I slipped and Iwould have gone overboard... and Mr. Dawson here saved me and he almostwent over himself.

MASTER AT ARMS                                 (to Jack)Was that the way of it?Rose is begging him with her eyes not to say what really happened.                                   JACKUh huh. That was pretty much it.He looks at Rose a moment longer. Now they have a secret together.                              COLONEL GRACIEWell! The boy's a hero then. Good for you son, well done!                                 (to Cal)So it's all's well and back to our brandy, eh?Jack is uncuffed. Cal gets Rose to her feet and moving.                                    CAL                            (rubbing her arms)Let's get you in. You're freezing.Cal is leaving without a second thought for Jack.                                  GRACIE                                   (low)Ah... perhaps a little something for the boy?                                    CALOh, right. Mr. Lovejoy. A twenty should do it.                                   ROSEIs that the going rate for saving the woman you love?                                    CALRose is displeased. Mmm... what to do?Cal turns back to Jack. He appraises him condescendingly... a steerageruffian, unwashed and ill-mannered.                                    CALI know.                                 (to Jack)Perhaps you could join us for dinner tomorrow, to regale our group withyour heroic tale?                                   JACK                        (looking straight at Rose)Sure. Count me in.                                    CALGood. Settled then.Cal turns to go, putting a protective arm around Rose. he leans close toGracie as they walk away.                                    CALThis should be amusing.                                   JACK                            (as Lovejoy passes)Can I bum a cigarette?Lovejoy smoothly draws a silver cigarette case from his jacket and snaps itopen. Jack takes a cigarette, then another, popping it behind his ear forlater. Lovejoy lights Jack's cigarette.                                  LOVEJOYYou'll want to tie those.                         (Jack looks at his shoes)Interesting that the young lady slipped so mighty all of a sudden and youstill had time to take of your jacket and shoes. Mmmm?Lovejoy's expression is bland, but the eyes are cold. He turns away to joinhis group.                                                                   CUT TO:67 INT.

And we are royalty.His fingers caress her neck and throat. He seems himself to be disarmed byRose's elegance and beauty.

There are old women yelling, men playingchess, girls doing needlepoint and reading dime novels. There is even anupright piano and Tommy Ryan is noodling around it.Three boys, shrieking and shouting, are scrambling around chasing a ratunder the benches, trying to whomp it with a shoe and causing generalhavoc.

It was everything. It was them, it wastheir whole world. And I was trapped in it, like an insect in amber.                                (in a rush)I just had to get away... just run and run and run... and then I was at theback rail and there was no more ship... even the Titanic wasn't big enough.Not enough to get away from them.

ON JACK'S sketches... eachone an expressive little bit of humanity: an old woman's hands, a sleepingman, a father and daughter at the rail. The faces are luminous and alive.His book is a celebration of the human condition.                                   ROSEJack, these are quite good! Really, they are.                                   JACKWell, they didn't think too much of 'em in Paree.Some loose sketches fall out and are taken by the wind.

Rose is transfixed by the languidbeauty he has created. His nudes are soulful, real, with expressive handsand eyes. They feel more like portraits than studies of the human form...almost uncomfortably intimate. Rose blushes, raising the book as somestrollers go by.

Theweight of it is really slowing her down. She rips at the buttons andshimmies quickly out of the thing. She bounds up the stairs in herstockings and knee-length slip, to find herself in--191 A LONG CORRIDOR... part of the labyrinth of steerage hallways forward.She is alone here. A long groan of stressing metal echoes along the hall asthe ship continues to settle. She runs down the hall, unimpeded now.                                   ROSEHello? Somebody?!She turns a corner and runs along another corridor in a daze. The hallslopes down into water which, shimmers, reflecting the light. The margin ofthe water creeps toward her. A YOUNG MAN appears, running through thewater, sending up geysers of spray. He pelts past her without slowing, hiseyes crazed...                                   ROSEHelp me! We need help!He doesn't look back. It is like a bad dream. The hull gongs withterrifying sounds.The lights flicker and go out, leaving utter darkness. A beat. Then theycome back on. She finds herself hyperventilating. That one moment ofblackness was the most terrifying of her life.A STEWARD runs around the nearest corner, his arms full of lifebelts. He isupset to see someone still in his section. He grabs her forcefully by thearm, pulling her with him like a wayward child.                                  STEWARDCome on, then, let's get you topside, miss, that's right.                                   ROSEWait. Wait! I need your help!

And he won't let her go.She SHOUTS in his ear, and when he turns, she punches him squarely in thenose. Shocked, he lets her go and staggers back.                                  STEWARDTo Hell with you!                                   ROSESee you there, buster!The steward runs off, holding his bloody nose. She spits after him. Justthe way Jack taugh: her.She turns around, SEES: a glass case with a fire-axe in it. She breaks theglass with a battered suitcase which is lying discarded nearby, and seizesthe axe, running back the way she came.192 AT THE STAIRWELL she looks down and gasps. The water has flooded thebottom five steps. She goes down and has to crouch to look along thecorridor to the room where Jack is trapped.Rose plunges into the water, which is up to her waist... and powersforward, holding the axe above her head in two hands. She grimaces at thepain from the literally freezing water.                                                                   CUT TO:193 INT.

ROSEWill this work?                                   JACKWe'll find out.They are both terrified, but trying to keep panic at bay. He positions thechain connecting the two cuffs, stretching it taut across the steel pipe.The chain is of course very short, and his exposed wrists are on eitherside of it.

JACKOkay, that's enough practice.He winces, bracing himself as she raises the axe. She has to hit a targetabout an inch wide with all the foce she can muster, with his hands oneither side.

Rose gingerly opens her eyes looks... Jack isgrinning with two separate cuffs.Rose drops the axe, all the strength going out of her.

The bowsprit is now barely above the waterline. Another ofBoxhall's rockets EXPLODES overhead. K-BOOM!

Jack and Rose stumble through, into the corridor.A STEWARD, who was nearby herding people along, marches over.                                  STEWARDHere you! You'll have to pay for that, you know.

They join the steeragestragglers going aft. In places the corridor is almost completely blockedby large families carrying all their luggage.AN IRISH WOMAN gives Rose a blanket, more for modesty than because she isblue-lipped and shivering.

Shesees that his lifebelt is off, lying on a table.                                   ROSEWon't you even make a try for it, Mr. Andrews?                                  ANDREWS                       (a tear rolls down his cheek)I'm sorry that I didn't build you a stronger ship, young Rose.                                   JACK                                 (to her)It's going fast... we've got to keep moving.Andrews picks up his lifebelt and hands it to her.

One by onethe band memebers turn, hearing the lonely melody.Without a word they walk back and take their places. They join in withHartley, filling out the sound so that it reaches all over the ship on thisstill night. The vocalist begins: "If in my dreams I be, nearer my God tothee..."THE HYMN PLAYS OVER THE FOLLOWING SEQUENCE:237 A seaman pulls off his lifebelt and catches up to Captain Smith as hewalks to the bridge. He proffers it, but Smith seems to stare through him.Without a word he turns and goes onto the bridge. He enters the enclosedWHEELHOUSE and closes the door. He is alone, surrounded by the gleamingbrass instruments. He seems to inwardly collapse.238 IN THE FIRST CLASS SMOKING ROOM Andrews stands like a statue. He pullsout his pocketwatch and checks the time. Then he opens the face of themantle clock and adjusts it to the correct time: 2:12 a.m. Everything mustbe correct.239 IN CAL'S PARLOUR SUITE water swirls in from the private promenade deck.Rose's paintings are submerged. The Picasso tranforms under the water'ssurface. Degas' colors run. Monet's water lilies come to life.240 DOWNANGLE on the two figures lying side by side, fully clothed, on abed in a FIRST CLASS CABIN. Elderly Ida and Isador Strauss stare at theceiling, holding hands like young lovers. Water pours into the room througha doorway. It swirls around the bed, two feet deep rising fast.241 IN A STEERAGE CABIN somewhere in the bowels of the ship, the youngIRISH MOTHER, seen earlier stoically waiting at the stairs, is tucking hertwo young children into bed. She pulls up the covers, making sure they areall warm and cozy. She lies down with them on the bed, speaking soothinglyand holding them.                                                                   CUT TO:EXT.

Workingfrantically, the men try to detach it from the falls so the ship won't dragit under. Colonel Gracie hands Lightoller a pocket knife and he sawsfuriously at the ropes as the water swirls around his legs. The boat, stillupside down, is swept off the ship. Men start diving in, swimming to staywith it.244 IN COLLAPSIBLE A Cal sits next to the wailing child, whom he hascompletely forgotten. He watches the water rising around the men as theywork, scrambling to get the ropes cut so the ship won't drag thecollapsible under.Fabrizio removes the lifebelt from Tommy's body and struggles to put it onas the water rises around him.245 CAPTAIN SMITH, standing near the wheel, watches the black waterclimbing the windows of the enclosed wheelhouse. He has the strickenexpression of a damned sould on Judgment Day. The windows burst suddenlyand a wall of water edged with shards of glass slams into Smith. Hedisappears in a vortex of foam.246 Collapsible A is hit by a wave as the bow plunges suddenly. Itpartially swamps the boat, washing it along the deck. Over a hundredpassengers are plunged into the freezing water and the area around the boatbecomes a frenzy of splashing, screaming people.As men are trying to climb into the callapsible, Cal grabs an oar andpushes them back into the water.                                    CALGet back! You'll swamp us!Fabrizio, swimming for his life, gets swirled under a davit. The ropes andpulleys tangle around him as the davit goes under the water, and he isdragged down. Underwater he struggles to free himself, and then kicks backto the surface. He surfaces, gasping for air in the freezing water.247 WALLACE HARTLEY sees the water rolling rapidly up the deck toward them.He holds the last note of the hymn in a sustain, and then lowers hisviolin.

The force of tons of water roaring down the shiptraps him against it, and he is dragged down under the surface as the shipsinks. He struggles to free himself but cannot.Suddenly there is a concussion deep in the bowels of the ship as a furnaceexplodes and a blast of hot air belches out of hte ventilator, ejectingFabrizio. He surfaces in a roar of foam and keeps swimming.                                                                   CUT TO:251 EXT.

Jack jumps down behind her.They join a crush of people literally clawing and scrambling over eachother to get down the narrow stairs to the well deck... the only way aft.Seeing that the stairs are impossible, Jack climbs over the B-Deck railingand helps Rose over. He lowers her again, and she falls in a heap. BakerJoughin, now three sheets to the wind, happens to be next to her. He haulsRose to her feet. Jack drops down and the three of them push through thecrowd across the well deck. Near them, at the rail, people are jumping intothe water.The ship GROANS and SHUDDERS.

Falling like a temple pillar twenty eight feet across it whompsinto the water with a tremendous splash. People swimming underneath itdisappear in an instant.Fabrizio, a few feet away, is hurled back by a huge wave. He comes up,gasping... still swimming. The water pouring into the open end of thefunnel draws in several swimmers. The funnel sinks, disappearing, but--Hundreds of tons of water pour down through the 30 foot hole where thefunnel stood, thundering down into the belly of the ship. A whirlpoolforms, a hole in the ocean, like at enormous toiler-flush. T. W. McCauley,the gym instructor swims in a frenzy as the vortex draws him in. He issucked down like a spider going down a drain.Fabrizio, nearby, swims like Hell as more people are sucked down behindhim. He manages to get clear.

JACKCome on, Rose. We can't expect God to do all the work for us.They struggle on, pushing through the praying people. A MAN loses hisfooting ahead and slides toward them. Jack helps him.261 THE PROPELLERS are twenty feet above the water and rising faster.262 JACK AND ROSE make it to the stern rail, right at the base of theflagpole. They grip the rai, jammed in between other people. It is the spotwhere Jack pulled her back onto the ship, just two night... and aliftime... ago.Above the wailing and sobbing, Father Byles' voice carries, cracking withemotion.

Its stern is high in theair, angles up over forty five degrees. The propellers are 150 feet out ofthe water. Over a thousand passengers cling to the decks, looking from adistance like a swarm of bees.The image is shocking, unbelieveable, unthinkable.

The massivestern section falls back almost level, thundering down into the sea andpushing out a mighty wave of displaced water.Jack and Rose struggle to hole onto the stern rail.

SEVERAL PEOPLEWe're saved!Jack looks at Rose and shakes his head, grimly.Now the horrible mechanics play out. Pulled down by the awesome weight ofthe flooded bow, the buoyant stern tilts up rapidly. They feel the RUSH OFASCENT as the fantail angles up again. Everyone is clinging to benches,railings, ventilators... anything to keep from sliding as the stern lifts.The stern goes up and up, past 45 degrees, then past sixty.People start to fall, sliding and tumbling. They skid down the deck,screaming and flailing to grab onto somehting. They wrench other peopleloose and pull them down as well. There is a pile-up of bodies at theforward rail.

It hangs there like that for a long grace note,its buoyancy stable.Rose lies on the railing, looking down fifteen stories to the boiling seaat the base of the stern section. People near them, who didn't climb over,hang from the railing, their legs dangling over the long drop. They fallone by one, plummeting down the vertical face of the poop deck. Some ofthem bounce horribly off deck benches and ventilators.Jack and Rose lie side by side on what was the vertical face of the hull,gripping the railing, which is now horizontal. Just beneath their feet arethe gold letters TITANIC emblazoned across the stern.Rose stares down terrified at the black ocean waiting below to claim them.Jack looks to his left and sees Baker Joughin, crouching on the hull,holding onto the railing.

The plunge gathers speed... theboiling surface engulfs the docking bridge and then rushes up the lastthirty feet.278 IN A HIGH SHOT, we see the stern descend into the boiling sea. The nameTITANIC disappears, and the tiny figures of Jack and Rose vanish under thewater.Where the ship stood, now there is nothing.

Over athousand people are now floating where the ship went down. Some arestunned, gasping for breath. Others are crying, praying, moaning,shouting... screaming.Jack and Rose surface among them.

It motors past her, like it is headed for Newfoundland.Beyond it Rose sees somehting in the water.                                   ROSEWhat's that?Jack sees what she is pointing to, and they make for it together. It is apiece of wooden debris, intricately carved. He pushes her up and sheslithers onto it belly down.But when Jack tries to get up onto the thing, it tilts and submerges,almost dumping Rose off. It is clearly only big enough to support her. Heclings to it, close to her, keeping his upper body out of the water as besthe can.Their breath floats around them in a cloud as they pant from exertion.

A demon of energy, he'shad everyone hold the boats together and is transferring passengers from 14into the others, to empty his boat for a rescue attempt.As the women step gingerly across the other boats, Lowe sees a shawledfigure in too much of a hurry. He rips the shawl off, and finds himselfstaring into the face of a man. He angrily shoves the stowaway into anotherboat and turns to his crew of three.

Daniel Marvin's wooden Biograph camera.Then, their white lifebelts bobbing in the darkness like signoposts, thefirst bodies come into the torch's beam. The people are dead but notdrowned, killed by the freezing water. Some look like they could besleeping. Others stare with frozen eyes at the stars.Soon bodies are so thick the seamen cannot row. They hit the oars on theheads of floating men and women... a wooden thunk. One seaman throws up.Lowe sees a mother floating with her arms frozen around her lifeless baby.

They are absolutely still. Their hands arelocked together. Rose is staring upwards at the canopy of stars wheelingabove her. The music is transparent, floating... as the long sleep stealsover Rose, and she feels peace.CLOSE ON Rose's face. Pale, like the faces of the dead. She seems to befloating in a void. Rose is in a semi-hallucinatory state. She knows she isdying. Her lips barely move as she sings a scrap of Jack's song:                                   ROSE"Come Josephine in my flying machine..."ROSE'S POV: The stars. Like you've never seen them. The Milky Way aglorious band from horizon to horizon.A SHOOTING STAR flares... a line of light across the heavens.TIGHT ON ROSE again. We see that her hair is dusted with frost crystals.Her breathing is so shallow, she is almost motionless. Her eyes track downfrom the stars to the water.ROSE'S POV... SLOW MOTION: The silhouetter of a boat crossing the stars.She sees men in it, rowing so slowly the oars lift out of the syrupy water,leaving weightless pearls floating in the air. The VOICES of the men soundslow and DISTORTED.Then the lookout flashes his torch toward her and the light flares acrossthe water, silouetting the bobbing corpses in between. It flicks past hermotionless form and moves on. The boat is 50 feet away, and moving pasther. The men look away.Rose lifts her head to turn to Jack. We see that her hair has frozen to thewood under her.                                   ROSE                             (barely audible)Jack.She touches his shoulder with her free hand.

ROSEOh, Jack.All hope, will and spirit leave her. She looks at the boat. It is furtheraway now, the voices fainter. Rose watches them go.She closes her eyes. She is so weak, and there just seems to be no reasonto even try.And then... her eyes snap open.She raises her head suddenly, cracking the ice as she rips her hair off thewood. She calls out, but her voice is so weak they don't hear her. The boatis invisible now, the torch light a star impossibly far away. She strugglesto draw breath, calling again.292 IN THE BOAT Lowe hears nothing behind him. He points to somethingahead, turning the tiller.293 ROSE struggles to move. Her hand, she realizes, is actually frozen toJack's. She breaths on it, melting the ice a little, and gently unclaspstheir hands, breaking away a thin tinkling film.                                   ROSEI won't let go. I promise.She releases him and he sinks into the black water. He seems to fade outlike a spirit returning to some immaterial plane.Rose rolls off the floating staircase and plunges into the icy water. Sheswims to Chief Officer Wilde's body and grabs his whistle. She starts toBLOW THE WHISTLE with all the strength in her body. Its sound slaps acrossthe still water.294 IN BOAT 14 Lowe whips around at the sound of the whistle.                                   LOWE                           (turning the tiller)Row back!

There is a suddendisturbance near her as two men burst through the cordon, running toembrace an older woman along the survivors, who cries out with joy. Thereporters converge on this emotional scene, and flashes explode.Rose uses this moment to slip away into the crowd. She pushes through thejostling people, moving with purpose, and none challenges her in theconfusion.                              OLD ROSE (V.O.)Can you exchange one life for another?

LOVETTYou had it the entire time?!FLASH CUT TO: A SILENT IMAGE OF YOUNG ROSE walking away from Pier 54. Thephotographers' flashes go off like a battle behind her. She has her handsin her pockets. She stops, feeling something, and pulls out the necklace.She stares at it in amazement.BACK ON KELDYSH, Rose smiles at Brock's incomprehension.                                   ROSEThe hardest part about being so poor, was being so rich. But every time Ithough of selling it, I though of Cal. And somehow I always got by withouthis help.She holds it out over the water. Bodine and a couple of the other guys comeup behind Lovett, reacting to what is in Rose's hand.                                  BODINEHoly shit.                                  LOVETTDon't drop it Rose.                                  BODINE                            (a fierce whisper)Rush her.                                  LOVETT                                (to Bodine)It's hers, you schmuck.                                 (to her)Look, Rose, I... I don't know what to say to a woman who tries to jump offthe Titanic when it's not sinking, and jumps back onto it when it is...we're not dealing with logic here, I know that... but please... think aboutthis a second.                                   ROSEI have. I came all the way here so this could go back where it belongs.The massive diamond glitters. Brock edges closer and holds out his hand...                                  LOVETTJust let me hold it in my hand, Rose. Please. Just once.He comes closer to her. It is reminiscent of Jack slowly moving up to herat the stern of Titanic.Surprisingly, she calmly places the massice stone in the palm of his hand,while still holding onto the necklace. Lovett gazes at the object of hisquest. An infinity of cold scalpels glint in its blue depths. It ismesmerizing. It fits in his hand just like he imagined.                                  LOVETTMy God.His grip tightens on the diamond.He looks up, meeting her gaze. Her eyes are suddenly infinitely wise anddeep.                                   ROSEYou look for treasures in the wrong place, Mr. Lovett. Only life ispriceless, and making each day count.His fingers relax. He opens them slowly. Gently she slips the diamond outof his hand. He feels it sliding away.Then, with an impish little grin, Rose tosses the necklace over the rail.Lovett gives a strangled cry and rushes to the rail in time to see it hitthe water and disappear forever.                                  BODINEAww!! That really sucks, lady!Brock Lovett goes through ten changes before he settles on a reaction... HELAUGHS. He laughs until the tears come to his eyes. Then he turns to Lizzy.                                  LOVETTWould you like to dance?Lizzy grins at him and nods. Rose smiles. She looks up at the stars.308 IN THE BLACK HEART OF THE OCEAN, the diamond sinks, twinkling end overend, into the infinate depths.                                                                   CUT TO:309 INT. ROSE'S CABIN / KELDYSHA GRACEFUL PAN across Rose's shelf of carefully arranged pictures:Rose as a young actress in California, radiant... a theatrically lit studiopublicity shot... Rose and her husband, with their two children... Rosewith her son at his college graduation... Rose with her children andgrandchildren at her 70th birthday. A collage of images of a life livedwell.THE PAN STOPS on an image filling frame. Rose, circa 1920. She is at thebeach, sitting on a horse at the surfline. The Santa Monica pier, with itsrollercoaster is behind her. She is grinning, full of life.We PAN OFF the last picture to Rose herself, warm in her bunk. A profileshot. She is very still. She could be sleeping, or maybe something else.                                                                   CUT TO:BLACKNESS310 THE WRECK OF TITANIC looms like a ghost out of the dark. It is lit by akind of moonlight, a light of the mind. We pass over the endless forecastledeck to the superstructure, moving faster than subs can move... almost likewe are flying.WE GO INSIDE, and the echoing sound of distant waltz music is heard. Therust fades away from the walls of the dark corridor and it istransformed... WE EMERGE onto the grand staircase, lit by glowingchandelier. The music is vibrant now, and the room is populated by men intie and tails, women in gowns. It is exquisitely beautiful.IN POV we sweep down the staircase. The crowd of beautiful gentlmen andladies turn as we descend toward them. At the bottom a man stands with hisback to us... he turns and it is Jack. Smiling he holds his hand out towardus.IN A SIDE ANGLE Rose goes into his arms, a girl of 17. The passengers,officers and crew of the RMS Titanic smile and applaud in the utter silenceof the abyss.                                                                   FADE OUTTHE END
