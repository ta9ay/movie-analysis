LAUNDROMAT, MOCKINGBURG, NEW YORK - NIGHTGlaring fluorescence, trash overflowing with cheap detergent boxes,empty Coke machine flashing all lights orange. Only two dryers arehumming. It's very late. Keep PANNING to......a wiry, gimlet-eyed WOMAN, furtively removing crumplednewspapers from a dryer. She flattens and folds them meticulously,her glance darting angrily everywhere. Top secret mission....a natty little black man. PARTRIDGE has spread a late supper ona neat cloth atop a dryer. Small cold fowl. Brie, baguette,olives. Bottle of red. An air of competence, of indomitableupbeatness. He ignores the spy-dressed-as-bag-lady as if she werenormal. More curious about......a hulking, rumpled figure scrutinizing Help Wanted ads as ifcramming for life's midterm exam. Thoughtful. Circles one,slowly. Set out on QUOYLE's dryer are one Snickers bar and fourempty snickers wrappers. His version of cold supper. He reachesfor the candy, but seeing it's the last one, he......rises. Goes to the candy machine. Drops in his 65 cents, hitsthe button. The Snickers starts to fall, but gets caught in themechanism at the last moment. Quoyle blinks dully. One moreretelling of the story of his life. He BANGS the machine half-heartedly. Nope. Shakes it with his shambling strength. Nada.POUNDS the coin return button. Hat trick. He empties his pocket.Studies the results. Not enough. And without so much as a sigh......he ambles back to his dryer. Starts to unwrap the lastSnickers. Partridge taking this all in. But Mata Hari of theNeat Newspapers goes to the candy machine, KICKS it violently. Outfall the Snickers and the 65 cents. She scoops up both, turns in asingle motion to......GLARE death at the enemy. Quoyle opens his mouth to comment.But. Doesn't. Resumes unwrapping his supper, as......his dryer STOPS. He pops it open. Stares in. Blinks.Suddenly YANKS a tangle of graying shirts out onto the grimy floorto reveal they have been......STAINED streaky BLUE by a cheap pen, quietly melting amid thepile. This slips beneath even Quoyle's expectation level. Thebig, soft face is pitifully, yes, even adorably, devastated.                             QUOYLE (a murmur)                Ruined.And to the bystander.     This seems a comment on more than shirts.                          PARTRIDGE (softly)                Nah. Rub the ink with hot salt and                talcum powder.Quoyle's head WHIPS around.     As if he thought he was alone.                          QUOYLE (V.O.)

QUOYLE (V.O., just staring)                Then again. If you're that kinda                guy. It don't.                          PARTRIDGE                And put a cuppa bleach in, next                time through.As Quoyle gazes at his benefactor, the woman sneaks up, SNATCHEShis Help Wanted ads. Races them over to her dryer. As the boyswatch, she shoves them in, starts the machine with Quoyle's coins,and glares fiercely back at us. A mother bear protecting her cubs.Partridge chuckles. Holds out his hand...                             PARTRIDGE                Partridge.Quoyle glances at the little man's cold fowl supper.                           QUOYLE                Uh.

BUNNY'S ROOM - NIGHT, FIVE YEARS LATER...an ECU of Bunny, now six years old, asleep in the flickeringblue light of a nearly-mute TV. Apparently she was watchingSportscenter.

Quoyle gently lays Bunny on her bed, and lurchesINTO the hall, to see Petal disappearing into her bedroom, and hehurries to stop the door before it slams in his face.When she turns, she is wasted, feral, and somehow as sexy as ever.Her laser glare. What the fuck do you want?                               QUOYLE                   There's.    Cold chicken.Really?

QUOYLE                 Uh. No, Bunny and I like to...                 uh, early to bed, earl...                           AGNIS                 Losin' your wife, your folks, and                 your job'd depress anybody. It's                 a wonder you don't sleep all day.Not that she seems to approve. Not at all. His eyes now drift tothe large, well-used SUITCASES dangling from her powerful hands.                           AGNIS                 Thought I'd stay a day or two.                 Give you some relief with th...And stops.   The mouth doesn't smile.     But the eyes crinkle slightlytoward......Bunny. Who has crept out in her jammies.         Hugging a sack ofPepperidge Farm cookies like it was a teddy.                          AGNIS (to Bunny)                You like blue dogs named Warren?The little girl nods.     As if she certainly does.                          AGNIS                I got one in the car.INT. PARLOR - LATERIn the far corner of the room, Bunny plays with WARREN, a sweet,ugly dog. Toothless and, undeniably, blue.                          QUOYLE (O.S.)                I never knew her, really.See him now, sipping his tea.     Wallowing in the detritus of hisemotions.                          QUOYLE                But she was driven by terrible                forces, no one could understand.                She was a locked door. Even to me.Agnis in the good chair. Teacup on her ample lap. Assessing aphoto on the end table, Petal's arctic eyes, rigidly seductivepose. The snapshot enshrined by a neighboring votive rose in itsjelly jar glass.                          AGNIS                So she wasn't just a bitch in                high heels?Quoyle's eyes cut instinctively toward his daughter, her innocenceprotected by distance and absorption with Warren's passivity.                          AGNIS                Don't stress. She mighta heard worse                from her momma. I'm only guessin'.                          QUOYLE                Some people probably thought Petal                was bad clear through.                             AGNIS                People.     Are a cynical lot.                          QUOYLE                I think she just couldn't get                enough love.Agnis' unblinking eyes.                           AGNIS                I think the evidence.     Is on                your side.The eyes study him.     Dissect him, even.                             AGNIS                   I'm headed north, Nephew, to                   where our family comes from, in                   Newfoundland. Thought I'd never                   go back. But the older y'get...Clucks her tongue.                             AGNIS                   There's a pull. Becomes an ache.                   As if where your people started                   held a purpose for you. Like                   you're a piece in a puzzle...Not a smile. But something.        A softening of timbre, a flickerbehind the eye.                             AGNIS                   ...lookin' for where y'fit.Lifts her cup.                               AGNIS                   You, too.Takes a sip.     His eyes have narrowed in a burlesque of suspicion.                             QUOYLE                   In what sense do you m...                             AGNIS                   You need to come, Nephew.Just like that.                             AGNIS                   Nothin' here but hurt. You got                   to start fresh, everythin's gone!Hmmn?                             AGNIS                   The trip'll clear your head.                   Be educational for the squirt.                   Teach ya the world's still spinnin'                   outside this toxic slice o'Hades.                   And who knows...?Tilts her head.     Who knows.                             AGNIS                   They must have a newspaper up                   there. Somebody's gotta write it.He just stares.     The blankest of the blank.                            AGNIS                  Tell the truth, I'd appreciate                  the company. You two are pretty                  much my family.His face softens.       Hadn't thought of it that way.      And seeingthis...                            AGNIS                  A pot o'coffee would hit the spot.                  Drop o'whiskey would fit nice in it.She waits.   He rises.      And when he does...                            AGNIS                  Which one's my brother?He blinks.   She looks at two URNS on the mantle.                               QUOYLE                  Uh.     There's Mom.   And that's Poppa.The name of the funeral home tastefully stenciled.           He clears histhroat...                            QUOYLE                  Those are temporary.                               AGNIS                  Coffee.     And maybe a sweet.Quoyle nods, glad to serve.       Heads off to the kitchen.      Agnis looksat Bunny and Warren.                            AGNIS                  She needs to go outside.                            BUNNY                  I know why.She runs out, the dog trotting after.        Alone now......Agnis pulls something from her large carpetbag purse.           It is anoversized ZIPLOC BAG. She stands. Crosses to......her brother's urn. She removes the lid. Turns the huge Ziplocupside down to COVER the urn. Then, in one deft movement......UPENDS the urn, a cascade of ash tumbling into the Ziploc.Seals it. Sets it to one side. Then, from her purse......another ziploc already filled with replacement ashes. She poursjust enough into the urn. That should do it. Stashes the restback in her purse. Turns now to lift......the Ziploc with her brother's remains.     Stares at it.   ThinkHamlet with Yorrick's skull.                             AGNIS                   What say, Guy? The dumpster?A beat.     Eyes flat and neutral.                             AGNIS                   Just a thought.EXT. PHANTOM HIGHWAY - MISTY NIGHTA world of fog and reflected high beams. Big rig pulls over, andPetal climbs up and in, her short red dress fluttering about herthighs.The truck is roaring heedlessly through dense cloud. The DRIVER isgross and bald, snot suspended from his nostrils. He lets go ofthe wheel to run his hairy hands UNDER Petal's dress, while throughthe shotgun window, we see......Quoyle FLYING along outside, like a superhero. Except he isshocked bug-eyed by the tableau. The disgusting driver buries hisface in Petal's hair, she throws her head back laughing, and thedriver becomes Quoyle's FATHER, Quoyle silently SHRIEKING outsidethe window, and SMASH cut to...EXT. DECK, PORT-AUX-BASQUES FERRY - DAY...Quoyle    blinking awake on the deck of a pitching ferry. Fogand cliff    and the raw Atlantic. And SOARING alongside, an amazingnumber of    MARITIME BIRDS...the gulls and terns seeming to stareQuoyle in    the eye as they glide past. Maybe they prompted hisdream.                             AGNIS (O.S.)                   They draft off our air currents,                   it's quite premeditated.She stands at the rail.     Smoking, despite the wind.                             AGNIS                   They actually know the ferry                   schedule. Show up on time                   better'n the Newfies.He smiles a seasick smile. Lurches from his bolted-down chair tojoin her. She nods back toward......Bunny through the glass window, snuggled with Warren, feedingthe dog french fries.                             AGNIS                   ...image of m'sister, Feeny.                   She's married to a falconer in                   Arabia, now. Has to wear a black                 thing over her face.                           QUOYLE                 Like the falcon.She stares in his eyes. Yes, like the falcon.       They are growing oneach other in a companionable way.                              AGNIS                 Nice.     To be with family.He smiles.   It is nice.                           AGNIS                 'Specially big shots. Who can                 land a job with one phone call.His smile changes color.      A quiet pride in the modest...                            QUOYLE                 Well, that was my friend Partridge.                 Made the call. And it's just an                 interview.When Quoyle looks back in at Bunny, he sees she is staring off atsomething with full attention. He follows her gaze to......a honey-haired MOTHER with her small BOY snuggled in her lap.She is feeding him an ice cream bar with evident tenderness. Andthough the child's face is blissfully vacant, she murmurs to himwith serious intent.INT. CAR, GREAT NORTHERN PENINSULA - DAYQuoyle driving a winding, rutted road, high above the coastline.Cracked cliffs in volcanic glazes. Long-abandoned settlementsjutting from raw granite. Icebergs on the horizon above therumpled, creased fabric of a brilliant blue sea. Beside him...                           AGNIS                 On the map, here. Quoyle Point.                 Named after us. You.It all seems at once awe-inspiring, frighteningly lonely.      Andhostile as hell.EXT. QUOYLE'S POINT - SUNSETThe car pulls up in a shroud of mist. Our family climbs out,stares into what seems the center of a dense cloud, until......the fog LIFTS. And like a ghost, a GREEN HOUSE appears.       Then,disappears. Then, APPEARS again. This time, to stay.                           AGNIS (bottomless pride)                 I was born here.                          BUNNY                The green makes me hurl.                    (Warren whimpers)                Her, too.The cloud lifts further, and we see the house stands alone on arocky point. The bay roils far below. Half the window panes aregone. Holes in the roof, paint flaking everywhere. Lonely andscary as any haunted house.                          AGNIS                Empty 44 years. And look at that                roofline, straight as a ruler.Quoyle looks at her.     Looks at the house.   Looks at her.                          QUOYLE                Take it easy. Floor mighta fallen                into the cellar.                          AGNIS (laughs)                Not likely. There is no cellar.                No foundation, neither.She takes Bunny's squirming hand and starts toward the house, as ifcrossing Jordan.                          AGNIS (calling back)                The whole thing's lashed with cable,                to iron rings set in the rock!He just stands there.     Sees the cables now, the rings.                             QUOYLE (calling out)                Uh.     Why would they do th...                          AGNIS (calling back)                Long story!Apparently a private one, too.     Keeps walking.INT. GREEN HOUSE - TWILIGHTInside the dank, corroding place. We can feel all 44 years ofabandonment. CRASH! The door FLIES open. Quoyle with his tireiron steps aside, and......Agnis drags Bunny inside. The wind shrieking low throughopenings like proper spirits. Even this bold child is frightened.So Agnis leans to murmur...                          AGNIS                Up those stairs, Aunt Pinkie slept.                So fat she couldn't get down to her                chamber pot. Wanna see if she's                still there?Asked as a serious question.     Bunny nods.   Let's.ANGLE...upstairs now. Agnis marching through like MacArthurreclaiming the Philippines. Room after rough-hewn spacious room,light spiking through a thousand roof holes in assorted shapes.                             AGNIS                   Well. Too late to drive that road                   back 'round the bay. We'll camp                   in here tonight. Be right as rain.Quoyle looks down to his daughter.     Who nods, as if that were aperfectly natural suggestion.                             BUNNY                   Which one's Petal's room?   I'll                   sleep there.INT. GREEN HOUSE - LATE NIGHTCLOSE on Bunny's sleeping face.     PUSH INTO her closed eyes, andFADE to......a WINDOW, unearthly tendrils of FOG drifting past in moonglowwisps. Suddenly, a FACE appears, an animal. White. Wolf, or morelikely, dog. It stares in at us, is fleetingly joined by agrizzled HUMAN ghost, eyes FLASHING crazy, and......gone in mist.     CUT to...REAR ANGLE of Quoyle and Bunny, each rolled over onto one side,asleep in their sleeping bags. His arm across her protectively.Hers across Warren, who sleeps curled to her chest. PAN up to......the window.     Only the shimmer of cloud-like mist.     SNAP to...REVERSE ANGLE...Bunny's eyes.     wide open.INT. ROOM - DAWNCLOSE on Quoyle, stirring at the end of sleep.        His eyes flutteropen. A beat. He is alone. sits......BOLT UPRIGHT.ANGLE...front hallway, Quoyle's bulk POUNDING toward us, boots inhis hand. The front door ajar. And at the threshold, in adecorous semi-circle, six naked Barbies. Legs spread wide forbalance. Each staring out the doorway, to where......Bunny sits on the cold ground. Making some craft project withgreat care. Quoyle can breathe again, she's safe. Ambles out,crouches beside her. Close.She keeps working. Almost eerie concentration. He sees now thatshe is weaving a loop of dandelion stems, connected by aluminum poptops. He leans down. Kisses her head.                          QUOYLE                Is that a belt or a crown?No answer. That concerns him. The intensity of her focus. Henotices now, the soda and beer cans with their tops popped. Linedup in a row. He lifts one, liquid sloshes out. They're full.                          QUOYLE                Sodas get flat withou...

QUOYLE                That why the Barbies are                watching?                          BUNNY                They're being nice and patient.

Theshoelace necklace holds a dull metal KEY as a pendant.     He blinks.                          QUOYLE                I was lookin' for that all over                our old place.

QUOYLE                You had quite the heavy morning.                Take the rest of the day off.She doesn't smile back. Returns to her work. He looks out by thecliff, to see Agnis staring across the bay, Warren sitting at herside. He pulls on his boots. Gets to his feet.

QUOYLE                Yeh, her farts are pretty scary.                             BUNNY                I mean.     The white one!Now their eyes meet.    Matter-of-fact...

QUOYLE                I was gonna say.     I'll keep my                eyes peeled.And makes a funny gesture, like peeling his eyeballs. She goesback to work. His eyes linger. Then, he heads off toward thecliff. When he gets there...                          AGNIS (staring across the bay)                I'll get us a carpenter. Fix                the place up in no time.

This should be the real test, huh?Quoyle nods. Could be that. The sudden sound of footsteps abovethem, makes him look up sharply, to see......a fit young MAN in a toolbelt climbing down a ladder from theroof. The muscles of a stud, the shy smile of a boy, he waves agreeting and HOPS down the last six feet to the ground.

A small house, its grassyyard strewn with a phantasmagoria of painted wood figures,galloping horses, dogs balanced on wheels, a row of chrome hubcapson sticks. A zoo of the mind. To one side, a table piled withcrafts, ignored by......fifteen LITTLE KIDS running in all directions, like bundled,unbridled banshees. Looks like fun. Two harried MOTHERS aretrying to cope with the chaos. And there, under a tree......the honey-haired WOMAN Quoyle had seen on the ferry. And inthe rain. She is on her knees, tying the shoes of her vacant-facedSON. He trips and sprawls, but he is laughing. The woman smilestenderly and tousles his brown-straw hair.Quoyle gets up his courage. Walks Bunny over to them.       As wearrive, the woman looks up...                              QUOYLE (really nervous)                 Hullo.

She means, of course, the blankly-staring boy.                            QUOYLE                  Hey, how 'bout we ask what's wrong                  with you? There's nothing wr...                            WOMAN (to Bunny, softly)                  Sure, there is. This is Herry, and                  he has Down's Syndrome. It means                  he learns things very slowly.Oh.   HERRY smiles at Bunny.      Suddenly, wonderfully.                            BUNNY (to Herry)                  Know how to be a dog?She DROPS to all fours and starts YAPPING like a terrier. HerryLAUGHS with delight. Tumbles down to the grass and does hisimpression of a Chihuahua on speed.                            BUNNY (to the woman)                  He looks fast to me. Maybe he's                  cured.                               WOMAN                  Maybe.The kids waddle off in their canine personas. Alone with the womannow, Quoyle is near-catatonic.

As comfortable insilence as he is agonized. Then, she squints out at the otherwomen, desperately running ragged after the kids.                            WOMAN                  Neither of 'em.      They're just moms.Oh.                            QUOYLE                  Well, my lord, whoever runs the                  place should be giving this a                  little more attention.She looks back at him, blankly.

No one's even guarding that craft                  table, they could be running around                  with scissors and get hurt.The woman's eyes bottomless, unreadable.       The silence excruciatingfor poor Quoyle. He clears his throat.                             QUOYLE                  Um.   I write for the newspa...But she stands.

She's a                  vegetarian.Dawn, once described by Agnis as young and on the sexy side, isthat. Red lipstick and nails. Her eyes float up in a way thatsuggests reflexive sensuality.

GREEN HOUSE - DAYQuoyle exits the house, pulling on his jacket, and......stops. Something laid across his threshold. A long piece ofTWINE has been placed there. KNOTS tied evenly along its length.He glances back up to the second floor, thinking Bunny. Looks atthe thing again. Neat work. Odd. Slips it in his pocket.EXT. CLIFFSIDE - DAYQuoyle now making his way down a steep primitive trail through lushvegetation. The green house is far above him. The shimmering baynow just below. This way down as treacherous as it is wondrous,and Quoyle SLIPS in the tangle and wet, half-slides through wildangelica stalks and patches of dogberry, suddenly......LOSING his balance, TUMBLING roughly down a stretch, rolling,grasping a spruce trunk. Pulling himself to his feet, he hears...RUSTLING. Looks up, just as......a WHITE DOG appears through the bushes. Red eyes. Lips curledback.

Quoyle picks his way across the rocks tohis ungainly, much-maligned boat, as it bobs against the weathereddock. He crouches, and as he begins to untie it, his gaze driftsout toward the nearby point, and......something catches his eye. A boulder in the shape of a greatdog. And as he stares, there is something below it. Something ina cove protected from intrusion by a jagged ring of menacingrocks......it is a MAN in a yellow suit. His head under the surface as iflooking for fish. Arms and legs spread out like a starfish, thebody slides in and out of a small cave. Tugged by the sea like atop on a string.Quoyle stares in frozen shock.                          QUOYLE (V.O.)                Headline. Reporter Becomes Magnet                For Dead Men.No way in past the pounding surf, the savage rocks.    So Quoyleturns sharply. Squints across the bay.                          QUOYLE (V.O.)                What was my panic? He was already                dead. Maybe I thought, in some dim                way...CLIMBS into his boat, TURNS the engine over.    KICKS it in overdrivetoward the town across the bay.                          QUOYLE (V.O.)                ...if it wasn't too late for him.                It wouldn't be for Petal.STREAKING out, toward the black sky.    Racing to open sea where thechop INCREASES drastically. Closer.     Closer...                          QUOYLE (V.O.)                Once I was past the shelter of the                lee shore, and into the real wind.                I realized my mistake....clear of the point's protection, the wind ROCKS the tiny craft,swells coming BROADSIDE. The boat RISES, then DROPS with cruelspeed. Quoyle tries to swing the boat around, the propeller RACES,the bow PITCHES violently, SLAMMING down, the stern SWAMPED, thehull filling, swerving broadside just as the oncoming sea HITS withall its force, and the little boat......rolls OVER, Quoyle suddenly FLYING under water, limbs flailingin all directions...

QUOYLE (V.O.)                Stupid. Stupid to drown with Bunny                so young. No life jacket, no floating                oar. No sense.Back to the surface, GASPING for air. And then, daintily rowing asmall boat, unaffected by the waves, her filmy dress rippling inlight breeze...                          PETAL                Look, it floats.     Just like you.Is the lilting smile cruel?   Or only the irony that conveysintimacy, even affection.                          PETAL                Maybe it's filled with fat.And VANISHES. In her place, bobs a red BOX. A plastic beercooler. He LUNGES for it, GRIPPING the handles, resting his cheston its top.The waves RISE, mountainous now, and he rises and falls with them.He has been swept a mile from the nearest shore.INTERCUT...a winch pulling part of the Geo, streaming mud, fromswiftly flowing water. Police and bystanders gathered.                          QUOYLE (V.O.)                And I wondered. Am I going where                she's gone?BACK to the bay. A barely-conscious Quoyle still clings somehow tothe plastic cooler. But hours have passed. Light is fading.                          QUOYLE (V.O.)                ...and will I see her?He turns. And there she is. Beaming at him from the bow of herlittle rowboat, a smile ambiguous in the growing dusk. It could belove. From behind her a light GLOWS, giving Petal the aspect of anangel.She drops a wink.   FADES away.    And the light becomes......the BEAM from a fishing boat. Quoyle squints his swollen eyes,as strong hands WRENCH him from his box. From the sea. A voicewarbles, distorted by wind and Quoyle's diminished consciousness...                          JACK                Jesus Cockadoodle Christ!     I knowed                somebody was out here.Quoyle's teeth are chattering so hard, his body shivering sopainfully, Buggit hauls him over the rail and lays him down on awriggling mound of fish.                           JACK                 Thank god fer yer figure, me old son.                 A thin man woulda froze.Quoyle burrows into the fish, like nestling in a down comforter.Jack covers him with a heavy tarp. Crouches down close...                            JACK                 Good.   Yer lost th'boat.INT. BEDROOM - LATE NIGHTDim light. Quoyle stirs beneath the billowing down coverlet.

She's sitting just beside the bed in half-shadow. Her oxblood knitting across her lap.                             WAVEY                 Actually.    It's just my bed.Now he sees the cigarette.                           WAVEY                 Actually, it's not.

So he CLEARS his throat with a massive anddisgusting effort. It is gross and funny, and she smiles again.                           WAVEY                 Only when I'm worried.      I don't                 worry much.He rolls over, to see her better.      They are very close.                           QUOYLE                 You don't have to, I'm all right.

Beneath the dim lamp.       A picture ofJack and blond son Jesson. Guess what they're doing.                             WAVEY                   Mrs. Buggit called, knew Bunny was                   still with me. The kids are camped                   out in the parlor.A beat.

In case her mom would rather                go there.A thin stream of air escapes from his lips.                          QUOYLE                And she talked about it.      Just like                that.                          WAVEY                Sure, I lied. I said nice things                about her mother.Bitter smile.

He could just                say 'eeee,' like that.Mrs. Lumbull looks down. From her face as she responds, she hasalready devoted, over time, more professional attention to thistroublemaker than should be asked of any dedicated educator.                          BUNNY (O.S.)                She told him that recess was almost                over, an' she wasn't gonna make a trip                special, an' he could hold it.Herry, seemingly, disagrees. Still holding his crotch, he jumps upand down with greater agitation. She grabs him, rather roughly, bythe arm. Marches him over to...                          BUNNY (O.S.)                She made him stand against the wall....and walks off, pointedly ignoring him from ten feet away. Hescreams, pumping his fists in frustration. Grabs himself,suddenly. Whether or not we can see the dampness spread, we cansee his humiliation all too clearly. As his tears come......a figure BOLTS into frame from behind Mrs. Lumbull. Hunchedover like a linebacker, full speed ahead, LAUNCHING herself intothe back of the large woman's knees. Her feet go UP, and the restof her goes......DOWN like the proverbial amount of bricks. Herry's tears stopfast. Watching the woman shriek, and keep shrieking. Makes himlaugh. CUT...BACK TO...the berry path.   They are sitting on a fallen log.                          QUOYLE                See, a good dad would say hitting                is always wrong. You coulda hurt                her bad. I guess you know that.                          BUNNY                She wasn't hurt for real.     Just                screamed like a baby.Quoyle pulls out a single Snickers bar.                             QUOYLE                   Wish I'd seen it.     It really sounds                   funny.                             BUNNY                   Petal'll think so, too.He looks at her.      Nods, probably will.    Peels the candy bar free ofits wrapper.                             QUOYLE                   Well, there won't be any trouble at                   school. I'II take care of that.                              BUNNY                   How?He breaks the candy bar in half.        Tho not quite equally.                             QUOYLE                   Because the best thing about people.                   Is they can forgive each other. I                   heard that this morning.                             BUNNY                   That teacher. Is gonna forgive me?He nods.   Oh, yeh.                             QUOYLE                   That. And she won't want the story                   printed in the paper.Oh.                              BUNNY                   Well.   I don't wanna forgive her.                             QUOYLE                   Me neither.He holds out the two pieces of candy. She takes them both.         thebigger one in his mouth. As he chews...                             BUNNY                   I had to do it. 'Cept for Wavey,                   I'm the only family Herry's got.She nibbles at her own piece.                             BUNNY                   Like the ghost.     Who's not a ghost.Hmmn?                             BUNNY                   The one who ties the knots?     You're                  the only family he's got.Right?   Her father doesn't react.       He's even stopped chewing.                              BUNNY                  You said.And slowly.    Quoyle nods.    I said.EXT. NOLAN'S SHED - DAYQuoyle picks his way down to the battered boat shed, hidden at thefoot of his cliff. He carries a big carton, which we see has madethe journey slow and awkward. Across the gravel now, to......the door. HEAR the fire crackling, see the smoke curling.Takes a breath. Knocks softly. Then LOUDER.                            QUOYLE                  UNCLE NOLAN? CAN I COME IN?No answer.    Juggle the box, lift the latch.      Enter...INT.

QUOYLE                  Uncle. My daughter Bunny and I.                  We got you some hot bread. And some                  meat. Some dried fish.

What trick is this?So Quoyle sets the carton down in the squalor. Takes out a loaf offresh bread. One step forward. Lay it down.Good faith offering.    And......Nolan scuttles to it. Like a wary crab. He tears off a chunkof bread. Nibbles. He likes it. And as he eats...                            QUOYLE (softly)                  You tied those knots, huh?

A girl of 12, rawboned,husky, skating alone. We've seen her, in the photo at Quoyle'sdad's house. And as she skates, she looks up to see......a boy of 15, stocky, sullen. He was in the same photo. Onlynow, he steps onto the ice. Unbuttons his pants. Begins to slidetoward her on the soles of his fishing boots. She looks around.Snow banked on all sides of the pond. Nowhere to run on herskates.                           NOLAN (O.S.)                 Her brother, me son. She only                 had th' one.The girl, breathless, skating this way and that.

Lifts from her shopping bag a nice conser-vative one she's already picked for him. He SHIVERS, just as shedid. They share the trace of a grin, just alike. He walks off....Wavey trying on furry hats in a full-length mirror, as Quoylekeeps feeding her an endless supply from a double armful. Shepouts and poses like a runway model, basically frowning that thehats aren't working. He's staring at her as if nothing else existsin the universe. She knows it....Wavey alone at a cash register. The checker is ringing up aselection of lacy bras and panties. Suddenly, Wavey looks up tosee Quoyle at the register one aisle over, staring fixedly at herpurchases.

Plenty more to go. Staggersinto......Nutbeem's   tiny, threadbare trailer. Every conceivable surfaceunder stacks   of plastic-wrapped party platters of cold cuts, cheeseand red-eyed   olives. Nutbeem is jamming beers into tubs of ice.Quoyle peers   into the teensy closet that is the only bathroom...                            QUOYLE                  What's the barrel for?SEE it now.    Half a sawed-off empty BARREL, with MOLASSES stenciledin orange, fills the shower stall.                           NUTBEEM                 I'm British.

TRAILER - NIGHTVIEW out a window at the line of HEADLIGHTS still arriving. We areimmersed in the ungodly WHITE NOISE of an all-gentleman's Newfiesoiree, music pushed beyond the level of distortion, assortedgrunts, squeals, unintelligible words, things breaking. As westruggle to look around......every square inch is    crammed tight with semi-conscious drunks.Tert Card and some boys    circle the potato chip barrel, which hasbecome a handy urinal.     Near the door, Dennis holding forth, armtight around Quoyle who    listens, listens, chuckles. Then Quoylefights his way......OUT of the trailer, to cold night air where the party is MUCHwilder, given the elbow room. Quoyle steps OVER the supine form oBilly Pretty, who is singing to himself. Finds Jack Buggit with abeer in one hand a rum in the other. Wraps a drunken arm aroundJack's neck. Starts to talk in his ear. Jack looks suspicious. AFIGHT breaks out a few feet away. They don't notice. Closing in,to hear...                           QUOYLE (shouting against the din)                 SO THE NEXT DAY, THEY ALL SIT DOWN                 ON THE GIRDER.

FRENCHY'S WIFE SAYS, 'WHY                 DIDN'T HE COMPLAIN ABOUT THE MEAT                 PIE?' STATIE'S WIFE SAYS, 'I DON'T                 GET IT. HE ALWAYS MADE HIS OWN LUNCH!'Quoyle is chortling.   But Jack stares him dead in the eyes.                           JACK                 YOU'RE SURE. THE FELLER WAS A STATIE.                             QUOYLE                 OH, YAR.    FROM NEW HAMPSHIRE.At which point Jack BUSTS OUT laughing fit to wet his pants...                           JACK                 MADE HIS OWN LUNCH!POUNDING on poor Quoyle, who is also dissolved in hysterics.Nearby, the biggest and ugliest GUY at the party (no smalldistinction) leaps onto a tree stump brandishing an AXE.Even in this crowd, it commands a certain degree of attention.                           BIG UGLY GUY                 NOW WE ALL LOVES OLD FOOKIN' NUTBEEM,                 YAR???Cries of YAR! fill the woods.

Whatever he is shrieking may well prove ineffective.And rather suddenly.   Quoyle is left alone.Among the conscious, that is.INT. WAVEY'S HOUSE - NIGHTKnitted wool, the color of oxblood, lies across a timeworn leatherottoman. In front of it, little Herry dances a shuffle-foot jig ofhis own design. The music seeps from a venerable accordian, playedearnestly by his serious mom, nodding and tapping her foot to thetime of his steps.There is a feeling of empowerment and release in Herry. His grinsplits his round face. His eyes say that his heart is dancing.PULL SLOWLY BACK...through the window, past the porch, across thefront yard. To a figure. By the fence. He stands motionless.Except his foot is tapping, very slightly, to the time of themusic.We can't tell how much Quoyle sees.    But his eyes say that hisheart is drowning.EXT. NUTBEEM'S TRAILER - MORNINGAs Quoyle shuffles up, we see Nutbeem's trailer has been turnedcompletely OVER onto its side. Walls are crushed and splintered.It's a train wreck.Sitting on the cinder blocks that once supported it, Nutbeem,and Dennis swig beers.                          NUTBEEM (cheery)                You're looking dishy, Q.                           QUOYLE                Feeling that and more.

You're moving in with Dennis, no                matter how fond you are of his wife.Quoyle looks sadly at the trailer.    Realizing it was his place thatgot trashed.                          NUTBEEM (laughs)                And the boat! Omigod!                          BILLY                I'm some disgusted.    With the human race.                          NUTBEEM                I'da never made it, anyway. Storms                would have blown me to bits. You                boys saved my life. Yes, you did.The boys look at each other.    Humiliated by his generosity.                            NUTBEEM                   I've gathered my savings, and am                   flying to Brazil. Where water is                   swimming pool green. And I grill                   yellowtail steaks with lime and                   garlic, watercress and Tobasco.                   Touch of curry.

Just                   can't keep 'em.Maybe too light not to be obvious.     Billy looks from Quoyle to thetrailer. And back.                             BILLY                   It's too bad.Which seems to cover everything.EXT. JACK BUGGIT'S SKIFF - DAYQuoyle alone with Jack in open water. Pulling on a slicker,gloves, picking up a knife.

QUOYLE                  His whole life would be changed.                  If he could come upon. A fishing                  license.Jack's eyes.   Flat and cold as the cod he's gutting.                            JACK                  Well, there's only one a those                  issued per family. So how exactly                  would he do that?This is not.   Going well.   A dangerous silence.                            JACK                  Even doughnuts, y'know.   Can                  push their luck.INT. WAVEY'S PARLOR - DUSKThe day care contingent more organized today. Sort of. Bunnyleading a spirited round of red-light/green-light, as......Quoyle enters with a big cardboard box full of presents. As heshrugs off his coat, he looks at the Christmas tree, its winkinglights. The decorations that seem to be everywhere, many handmadeby these children. He watches Bunny call out 'Red Light!', only tohave Herry ignore it and tackle her anyway.Mixed emotions, to be sure. A feeling of family he can at leastvisit, yet will never be his own. The sad edge catches up withhim, so he strolls on into......the kitchen. Wavey baking, what else.      She smiles to see him.A friend's smile.                            WAVEY (Southern belle)                  Why, Mistuh Quoyle. You shouldn't                  have!He smiles back.    Takes her in for a telling beat, before...                             QUOYLE                  Uh.   I didn't. Most of these                 are for Herry.Even better.                           QUOYLE                 There's two. Are yours.They are on top. Personally wrapped in his slightly bulging,fine-motor-control-challenged, personal style. Be sets them on thecounter.                            QUOYLE                 You prob'ly want to wait for                 Christmas.Meaning, please don't. So she wipes her hands on her apron.    Letshim see her eyes dance just a flicker.                           WAVEY                 Oh, I'm much too excited.Delicately unwraps the first. Lifts out a PORCELAIN TEAPOT, finelypainted with an assortment of BERRIES. She holds it in her hands,at once admiring and wistful. Wondering if there's a message abouttheir moment together while berry-picking.                           QUOYLE                 It's from a museum catalogue.       But                 it's not real. It's a copy.                           WAVEY (still gazing at it)                 It is my favorite teapot.A simple pronouncement. She opens the second, flat and narrow. Itis a TURQUOISE BRACELET. Actually, kind of stunning. She blinks,taken back by the beauty and perhaps the expense.                           QUOYLE                 It's nice for your eyes.     I thought.She doesn't sayanything.   Lets it dangle from her fingers, catchthe light.                           QUOYLE                 It's for everyday. You don't have                 to save it for special.She looks to him. Her eyes are shining maybe more than she wants.Her voice perhaps softer than she even intends...                           WAVEY                 Oh, I'll save this, all right.Covers.   With only a slightly more than friendly smile.                           WAVEY                 And I'll think of you.     When I                put lot on.He can only nod. He'd like that.    She holds up one finger, wait asecond. And hurries off.So he waits. Looking at her kitchen. Feeling his feelings.         Sheis back, with two boxes. Sets them down. Nods, go ahead......one is heavy and square. He opens it to find a LEATHER-BOUNDCASE. He looks at her, smiles in his childlike way. Opens thecase, which reveals......two leather-bound VOLUMES. One a dictionary.      The other athesaurus. He is obviously moved.                          QUOYLE (a murmur)                You must have me mistaken. For                a writer.And when he looks up.                          WAVEY                I don't make mistakes.     About                that kind of thing.He stares at her long enough to make her nod toward the otherpackage. Big and flat, but not heavy at all. He lifts the lid,and pulls out......a huge comfy SWEATER.   In oxblood wool.    He is completelystunned to realize...                          WAVEY (so pleased)                Well, you can't be surprised. You've                seen me knitting it for months.                          QUOYLE                It was so big, I thought it was a                tea cozy for your car. But if it's                for me, it has to be bigger, huh?Put it on, put it on! So he slips it over his head. Big enoughand then some. This worries her. She plucks at it...                           WAVEY                Well.   You'll grow into it.                          QUOYLE                You kiddin'? After the holidays,                we'll have to stretch it.He's just beaming. Hugs himself to show how warm it is.      Thesilence is companionable. Then...                          QUOYLE                Not used to a woman.     Giving me                presents.She raises a brow.     Can scarcely believe that.                            QUOYLE                  One Christmas with Petal, I gave her                  eleven things. And I wrapped them.                  And watched her open them up.She holds her friendly smile.     But her eyes have changed.Slightly.                            QUOYLE                  She didn't have anything for me.                  Like every year. But this one                  time, she said, 'Wait a minute.'Wait a minute.                            QUOYLE                  She ran to the kitchen. I heard                  the fridge open. She came back.                  With her hands hidden behind her.                  Then, she held out...Even his voice.    Betrays the longing.                             QUOYLE                  Two brown eggs. She gave them                  to me from her own hands. They                  were cold.He smiles, self-conscious.                            QUOYLE                  Must sound really stupid.   But                  they meant a lot to me.Silence.   A soft...                             WAVEY                  Well.   It's the thought that counts.He nods.   He's glad she understands.                            QUOYLE                  I broke 'em, careful. Made her an                  omelette with 'em. And I saved the                  shells. In a little box.She can't help but show her surprise at that.                            QUOYLE                  Oh, yeh. They're on a shelf                  behind my desk. At the paper.He looks worried now.     Shouldn't have brought this up.   And seeingthis...                             WAVEY                   I know how it is. To hold onto                   something good. In the middle of                   all the bad.He nods.     But feels truly awkward now.     So...                             QUOYLE                   Well. I gotta collect Bunny.                   Beety's gonna have supper waiting.Right.     She nods.   She understands this, too.                                WAVEY                   Thank you.     Thank you, very much.Takes her teapot and her bracelet.        Holds them.     A gentle barrier.Her hands now too full for a hug.                              QUOYLE                   Well.   Merry Christmas!With a wonderful smile.                             WAVEY                   Merry Christmas.With one of her own.INT. SCHOOL AUDITORIUM - NIGHTQuoyle enters a packed auditorium, festooned for Christ's birthdaywith every trimming imaginable. Rough fishermen in black jacketsthey wear once a year, women in finery, schoolkids at their well-scrubbed best, antsy with anticipation. The BUZZ is audible,palpable. No Broadway opening could hope for this level ofeagerness.As Quoyle comes down the aisle, we see faces we know. Boys fromNutbeem's party. Billy Pretty with Jack and Mrs. Buggit. AlvinYark and his bird-like wife. The old-timer who sold Quoyle hisboat. Mavis Bangs with an empty seat next to her, must be savedfor Agnis. All the kids from daycare. Still, Quoyle searching forthe face he doesn't find. And finally......to the third row, where Dennis and Beety have saved him a seat.Beety gives him a peck on the cheek, and he smiles, settling in,nervous as hell, just as......the school principal, still dressed for England, walks to themike at center stage. Holds up her hands like the disciplinarianshe prides herself on being, and they quiet pretty fast.                             PRINCIPAL                   Your friends and neighbors, and                   most of all, your children. Have                worked hard to bring you the best                pageant ever.THUNDEROUS applause, whistling, stamping. She is frustrated for amoment. Then, waves cheerily against the din, shouting...                          PRINCIPAL                LET THE FESTIVITIES BEGIN!And RUNS off-stage, as we DISSOLVE THROUGH a SERIES OF ANGLES......the Big Ugly Guy who led the raid on poor Nutbeem's boat standsin a threadworn suit bulging with his bulk, singing DANNY BOY inthe sweetest tenor one could dream of. PAN an audience, rapt,motionless. Pavarotti never had more respect....Bunny and Marty walk timidly to the front of the stage. Martydressed in Christmas reds and greens. Bunny all in blue, whichdoes look good on her. Kids CALL OUT their names. The place fallsquiet. And the girls begin to sing a plaintive West African HYMNin small brave voices that sometimes harmonize. It is unexpectedand breathtakingly courageous. Two dads in the third row havetears flooding their eyes...                          DENNIS (gruff whisper)                Not bad, my kid, eh?                            QUOYLE (gruffer whisper)                I'll say.    She's as good as mine....Agnis Hamm walks out alone onto the stage, wearing a brownjersey, tweed skirt, yellow stockings and red slippers. She hasan odd look on her face, all serious and curious. The laughter andcalls die away to silence. Suddenly, one of her feet SCRATCHES atthe stage, her arms become WINGS, and with a CROONING and CACKLINGshe metamorphoses into a PEEVISH HEN protecting an egg. The housecomes DOWN with laughter and UNISON applause. Quoyle glances backat Mavis Bangs who puts her fingers between her teeth and WHISTLESin pure delight....Wavey Prowse walks onto the rear of the stage, in a long blacksmock, carrying her accordion. She turns to the wings, nods, andout comes little Herry clacking across the stage in tap shoes. Abeat of silence. Mom calls out: ONE, TWO, THREE, rolls into asavage hornpipe and Herry commences the JIG Quoyle once glimpsedthrough a window. Three hundred HEELS coming STOMPING down inperfect rhythm and lift Herry into a joyous bouncing, rattlingperformance that builds in intensity until the finish. He runsto the edge of the stage, bows DEEP from the waist, stands beamingin their applause. Then RACES offstage, his mom following withdignity, and we go with her into the wings...Once there, Wavey slips OUT of the smock, revealing to the dimnessof the wings, that she is wearing dancer's tights over drop-deadlegs. A close-fitting tunic covered with sequins and glass bugles,crystal diamonds, and dozens more glittering baubles that send ashimmer of prisms with her every breath. Herry hands her a tophat, a cane, and......she STALKS back onto the stage, her lithe body strutting andglinting. A hush of stupefaction falls, only to be washed awayby SHOUTS and WHISTLES, the kind of which have not been heardsince Gypsy Rose Lee startled her first roomful of rubes. Inthe bedlam......she TWIRLS the top hat on one finger, FLIPS it up in a doublesomersault, catching it square on her head. She leans on her caneAnd when at last they quiet...                           WAVEY                 We all know Billy Pretty's ways.                 Never save fifty cents, if you                 can save a dollar.She winks.   They laugh.   Billy laughing loudest.                           WAVEY                 Well, last Feb'ry, Billy wants                 t'get his grandfather clock repaired.                 Calls old Leander Mesher. Local                 call. No charge.Twirls the cane recklessly.    In the third row, a goggle-eyed Quoylecouldn't blink if he tried.                           WAVEY                 Well, says Leander, the big cost is                 pickup and delivery. Got t'charge                 fifty dollars, each way. Two strong                 boys. Gasoline. Air in the tires!That's right.                           WAVEY                 There's no cost for air in yer                 tires!, says Bill. Get wi' th'times,                 he's told. Tis called inflation!WAGGLES her eyebrows, Groucho-style.    They are busting their gutslaughing. Connoisseurs of wit.                           WAVEY                 Billy lives at the top of the hill,                 Leander at the bot tom, doncha know.                 So Billy gets a rope, HOISTS the                 grandfather UP on his back. And                 muttering the words fifty bucks...She puts her toe out, SLIPS wildly, windmilling her arms,pantomiming as she bends double under the phantom clock.                           WAVEY                 Mite slick. Four feet thick a ice.Tears are streaming from a hundred eyes and more.                           WAVEY                 Meanwhile, at the bottom, Auntie                 Fizzard, 91 years young, sets out                 in her non-slip galoshes and her                 cane with the rubber tip. Didn't                 yer, dearie?Bows to the old gal in the front row, who is scarlet-faced inhysterics, as all around her applaud. Wavey becomes her, inchingalong, casting fierce glances right and left to warn the world.                           WAVEY                 Meanwhile, at the top...She is Billy once more, beneath his burden, her long legs stutter-stepping to one side, then the other, slipping, skidding, thehowling all around her threatening to shatter walls, and...                           WAVEY                 ...OVER he goes, clock-side down,                 and PICKIN' UP SPEED!Miming the wild ride as they ROAR...                           WAVEY                 ...eight blocks, NINE, missing                 everything like a miracle, zeroing in on...She becomes Auntie Fizzard once more, shuffling, looking left,right, and suddenly up WILD-EYED!                           WAVEY                 CLIPS 'er inta the snow bank!Nods sadly.   Leaning on her cane.     When at last they quiet.                           WAVEY                 Just two galoshes stickin' outta                 the snow. She digs 'er way out.                 Brushes herself off. Looks at                 him sprawled like a turtle on his                 back, tied to his massive burden.                 She says...She says.                              WAVEY                 YOU THERE!     BILLY PRETTY!Levels a dead-eyed killer gaze.

Too dazzled to breathe.EXT. ROADSIDE DINER - EARLY MORNING.Lonely stretch of wooded road, middle of nowhere. Light snow juststarting to fall. A truck pulls up beneath a tree. Out climbs......Wavey. Looking grim, walking slow. Crosses the road to aweathered diner. The woman who only smokes when she's worried,pulls out a pack of Camels. Looks through the diner's frostedwindow......a lone customer sits nursing his coffee. He is 40, lean, veryattractive. Dark hard eyes, set into worries of their own. Waveylights up. Watches in silence until......the man looks up. Their eyes meet through the glass.      Hold.And on his faint smile...She turns her back.   Starts up the road.ANGLE...he is walking beside her now. Snow drifting lazy, hersmoke curling up. He watches her anger, how cold and quiet andclosed. Smiles at her profile...                           HEROLD                 I shoulda come last night.     Seen                 the show.She can't even believe he said that.     Never looking at him...                           WAVEY                 Woulda been a thrill for the                 Christians among' em. They                 think you're dead.Keep walking.   His smile is gentle.                           HEROLD                 Well, then we got good news                 for th...                           WAVEY                 So does your son.A beat.

HEROLD (very soft)                 I can't undo the hurt I've done.                 Unless you let me.Gauging the feeling behind the bitterness.                           HEROLD                 There's a million reasons to send                 me away. Good ones. And only two                 reasons not to.Is she even listening?     He lets the silence hang.                           HEROLD                 I love you. And you love me.She stops walking.     Flips her cigarette off into the snow.       Turnsnow...Looks into his face.     And sighs.EXT. SHORELINE - DAYRear ANGLE of Agnis, crouching in the lightly falling snow. At theedge of the sea. The spot where she once sent her dog to rest.HEAR footfalls crunching slowly across the rocks. A bulky figurecomes into frame. Crouches down beside her. Close. She stares atthe gray horizon.                           QUOYLE (softly)                 Mavis Bangs. Told me where                 you'd be.No answer.

To a tangle ofbushes near the cliff.He walks to a broken cable. Crouches. His eyes running over thespace. Where his ancestor's home once stood. And then. Heturns...

The                 Stouthearted Woman, is when you                 need to lean on her.For some reason he could never name.     Tears are pooling in eyes.                           ALVIN                 The Tall and Quiet Woman? That's                 the silent partner who always walks                 'longside, so's yer never alone.Quoyle is nodding, now.     It all seems so right.                           ALVIN                 And the Demon Lover. That's just                 the frostin' on th' cake.A soft knocking at the door.                            ALVIN                 When y'find the woman who's all                 four? That's when y'got yer one                 true love.The bird-like woman enters.     The old man nods toward her.                           ALVIN                 ...like m'Gertie.But she isn't alone. A man enters behind her. It is DennisBuggit. And there are tears on his face. He brings a dreadfulsilence with him, because the face is an open grave.                          DENNIS                My dad went over the side this                mornin'. Tangled in th' sling-                stone line.A sob escapes from this strong man's throat.    He ignores it.    Noone knows what to say.                          DENNIS                If you could write a memorial t'                him. Fer t'morrow's Gammy Bird?                I'd be real grateful.EXT. JACK BUGGIT'S HOUSE - NIGHTThe road is jammed with parked cars and trucks and vans and wagonsFolks still streaming toward the brightly-lit house. Ever'bodyknows ever'body.INT. JACK'S HOUSE - NIGHTEvery room is filled with folks who wear their best. There iseating and chatter and even some pockets of laughter, as we movethrough the crowd. As if some have taken hold of a wake's well-meaning purpose. Others stand dazed, still wearing their pain andconfusion. There are children here, some hold a parent's hand,some giggle with each other. Snapshot of a community. Strugglingto cope.Quoyle and Bunny enter, holding hands, looking around.      As theycross the room......two figures step into their path. Two women holding hands,their bodies close together. Their feeling for each other open forall to see. One is Agnis. And the other. Isn't Mavis Bangs.                          DAWN                Happy New Year, Mr. Quoyle. I'm                sorry I missed you at the pageant.Slightly startled, Quoyle can't help but smile, despite the solemnoccasion. At the proud look on his aunt's face.                          DAWN                I was in the wings, a course.                Wasn't our girl somethin'?Our girl, a course, is Agnis.   Who nearly blushes at thecompliment.                          DAWN                I say, y'have t'love a woman. Who's                in touch with her inner chicken.Well, who could argue with that. Dawn leans up, kisses Quoyle onthe cheek. And with surprising softness...                              AGNIS                   Nephew.   You okay?                                BUNNY                   He's okay.     He's not sleeping in                   the box.Her great aunt looks at this child. Bends to plant an unexpectedkiss on the top of Bunny's head. The kid squirms, tugs her dadfirmly off, as he sends a parting wave.Into the parlor now. Quieter here, as the new arrivals thread pastJack Buggit in his open coffin, resting on black-draped sawhorses.Dennis and his mom stand by Jack, a hand and a word for each. Andmoving into the line...                             QUOYLE                   Remember what I told you.His words a murmur.     Hers are bolder...                             BUNNY                   If he's not sleeping.     Why do they                   call it a awake?He thinks.   As if it is a worthwhile question.                             QUOYLE                   We're the ones have to be awake.                   To how much we love him...Nods to himself.     Yes.                             QUOYLE                   And how we should be good to each                   other. While we have the chance.He looks down.     They are almost there.                                QUOYLE                   You think?She is thinking. Keeping the thoughts to herself. At the coffinnow, he lifts her up to see. Jack lies motionless, a wax figure ofhimself. Serene behind violet eyelids.                             BUNNY                   He looks like he's sleeping.Dennis looks over.     His stolid, grim face releases a smile for hisfriend.                             QUOYLE                   That's cos he's peaceful. No                   worries, anymore. No troubles.He sets her down.     Clasps Mrs. Buggit's hand.     And from hispocket...                          QUOYLE                I found this in Jack's drawer at                the paper. I don't know if it's                somethin' special...An enameled wreath with the initial R, backed by a long, sharp pinShe tears up again, just to see it.                          MRS. BUGGIT                Oh, it's his lodge pin.    We were                lookin' all over.She smiles bravely as she takes it.    Leans up to kiss his cheek.                          MRS. BUGGIT (a whisper)                Dennis showed me what y'wrote fer                th' paper. Did Jack proud.So they look at each other. Dennis clears his throat, looks away.And then, Quoyle is leading Bunny off.                          QUOYLE                You hungry? There's sandwi...                          BUNNY                Petal's peaceful, too.Just a statement of fact.    To no one in particular.   Dad squeezesher hand. Manages...                            QUOYLE                You bet.    You can count on tha...But she lets go. Scampers to a corner of the room.      To HerryProwse. And his mom.So Quoyle starts toward her, his heart in his throat. And whenWavey looks up. She is glad to see him. As he reaches her...She holds up her wrist. Dangling from it, her turquoise braceletShe wore her best for Jack. Quoyle stands very close. One lastthing from his pocket...                          QUOYLE                New Year's present.A small box. Wrapped as careful as he could.     She looks to hiseyes, really?                            QUOYLE                Oh, yeh.    It's a Quoyle tradition.Well, in that case. She takes it into her slender fingers. Undoesthe ribbon, the paper. Lifts the lid to see, resting in tissue......eggshells. Crushed almost to powder. Her heart comes straightto her eyes, even before the whispered...                              QUOYLE                   Thanks.   For the mirror.And across the room, Mrs. Buggit leans with trembling hands to fixthe Lodge pin to Jack's lapel. Shaking as she is, the handlurches, the big pin goes PLUNGING, and......a rattling COUGH. Rolls across this room. The world fallssilent. Jack's wife grabs her son's arm, and their eyes bug out,staring into the box.                             DENNIS                   DAD'S COME BACK!And LUNGES to help hs gurgling father free his shoulders from thecoffin's wedge. A sudden ROAR, there are SCREAMS, there is evenLAUGHTER and WHISTLING, complete chaos. And in the bedlam, a tugon Quoyle's coat...                              BUNNY                   See.   He woke up.EXT. OMALOOR BAY - DAYSunlit day of crystal perfection. The majesty of ice and toweringrock and shimmering water. A scale so majestic, any cynic would behard put to deny God's hand. And gliding into FRAME......a tiny skiff.     On its maiden run.   We CLOSE to see......painted on its side. THE FOUR WOMEN. One woman is rowing justnow, doing all the work. Her son sleeps in the bow. And in themiddle of the little boat......father and daughter. Are unpacking the picnic lunch.        There isa lot of food. This could take awhile.                             BUNNY                   That's a funny thing to say.   For                   the first thing he said.                             QUOYLE                   What? 'I'm keepin' m'damn lobster                   license'?Yeh.   That.                              QUOYLE                   Maybe he just said it. To make                   your Uncle Dennis laugh so hard.                   You think?She keeps unpacking.      Her face quiet and serious.   Her thoughts herown.                           QUOYLE (very softly)                 It's not fair, is it. That Jack                 woke up. And Petal didn't.And since he's said her thought aloud.      She tells him...                              BUNNY                 Well.     The world's not fair.     You                 said.She's not looking up.      But he knows she's listening.                           QUOYLE                 That's something the world is                 always teaching us. And sometimes,                 the learning comes later.That gets through.    Both adults can see it.                           QUOYLE (a murmur)                 You taught me that.Eyes resolutely down, she nods.      Remembers.                           QUOYLE                 You know. What we wait for?                 It's like the main stem of this                 boat. It gives us our shape.Her brow furrows.    Doesn't understand that.                           QUOYLE                 See, I know why you saved a place                 for Petal. All this time.On this.   She looks up.     Her dad is smiling from his eyes.                           QUOYLE                 Cos I'm the daddy. And you learn                 how to do. By watching me.And...                           QUOYLE                 You just watched.     Better than                 I knew.Still holding Bunny's eyes. He beckons to the woman rowing.C'mere, a second. So Wavey sets down her oars. Slides over.And Quoyle whispers to his daughter...                           QUOYLE                 Watch this.He leans his face. To Wavey's mouth. A kiss so tender, even achild can't turn away. The moment lingers. And when it ends...                           WAVEY                 I'm thanking your daddy.     For all                 my presents.                           BUNNY                 There was only two.Wavey looks at this girl.                           WAVEY                 More than two. Everything I need.                 Except...Except.   She gathers all the courage it takes to say...                           WAVEY                 Except a necklace.And waits. We can feel her heart pounding in her throat.       Bunnystares back with eyes no one could read. And then...                           BUNNY                 I got a box of 'em.   You could                 pick one.A hush over this bay.   A woman stunned and grateful.                           BUNNY                 Then you'd have everything you need.Well, that seems true. So, the woman nods.       Her eyes flutter down.In the silence, she unwraps a sandwich...                           WAVEY (a murmur)                 You want the cheese?                            BUNNY                 No.Okay, then. She hands that one to Quoyle.       And as she and Bunnylook for another, we PULL......UP and AWAY, an AERIAL ANGLE swirling above the shimmering bay.The boat so far below us. The people tiny specks. They could beanyone.Anyone at all.FADE TO BLACK.   ROLL END CREDITS.
