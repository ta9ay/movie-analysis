ANGEL EYES        by   Gerald DiPego    October 1999Seventh Draft/PolishFOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLYFADE IN:EXT. CITY STREETS (LOS ANGELES) - NIGHTCREDIT SEQUENCE.As OPENING CREDITS play, we study the city's nighttimepulse, ribbons of headlights moving and cross-connectinglike blood through the veins of a body --impressionistic, even beautiful, but what we're hearingis soulful trumpet-based MUSIC, mellow and haunting, themodern classic -- JAZZ sound of a Wynton Marsalis,putting a voice to our story. As CREDITS END, we...                                            DISSOLVE TO:POV - EXT. FREEWAY - NIGHTNow the MUSIC is GONE, SOUNDS are MUFFLED and visionblurred. We get the impression of urgent movement. Wehear BREATHING. There are VOICES, SHOUTS, even SCREAMS,but MUFFLED, far away. Only the breathing is distinct.We come to realize it is our breathing, and we are insidesomeone, looking out. The man whose POV this is is onthe edge of consciousness and not far from death. Helies on the pavement of a freeway at the site of anaccident only minutes after impact.His VISION goes IN and OUT of clarity. People areswarming around him and rushing by toward the carnage ofwrecked vehicles. A SIREN BLOOMS in the distance andapproaches haltingly. The man slips away, comes backtoward consciousness, slips again.The crowd around the downed man parts to allow passage toa police officer. It is a woman, Officer SHARON POGUE,LAPD. She kneels at the man's side, taking charge,speaking, but we hear only SLIVERS of SOUND. He sees herface clearly now, close above him.Sharon is   a dedicated professional and more. We see downinto her   to a place of real caring. She stares into oureyes and   connects. We begin to hear her now -- and thereare more   SIRENS converging in b.g.                          SHARON            Can you hear me?                   (shouting, off)            This one's conscious!                          VOICE (O.S.)            Paramedics on the way!We are slipping away again. Sharon holds us with hereyes, and she grips our hand.                                            (CONTINUED)                                                          2.CONTINUED:                           SHARON             Wait. Wait. Listen to me.    Can             you feel that?She holds on tight.     We see that our hand, held in herown, is bloody.                           SHARON             That's my hand. Hold it.    Go on             -- as hard as you can.We watch our hand gripping hers, and as we hold on, thesights and sounds around us grow more clear.                           SHARON             It's over, and I've got you, and             you're safe. You're safe now.             You got that? Don't let go.             Don't let me go.But our eyes unlock from Sharon's and DRIFT TO a patch ofnight sky. Her voice fades awawy. Our POV begins TOLIFT, MOVING TOWARD that sky, as the blue-black nightbegins to turn white. We GO INTO that white light and...                                                 DISSOLVE TO:EXT. LOS ANGELES CITYSCAPE - DAYWe PICK OUT a police car from the traffic and FOLLOW.The beat being patrolled is a mixed neighborhood withsome very rough edges.INT. POLICE CAR - DAYOfficer Sharon Pogue is driving the car. It is two yearssince we saw her at the accident site. Her partner,ROBBY LEWIS, sips coffee and keeps one eye on the CADmonitor which lists all area police calls. She slowsbehind a car that is crawling along, an old 60s car,driven by a young man and woman who sit very close on thebench seat. The car's ENGINE is MISSING and smoking.                           SHARON             That car is older than they are.                           ROBBY             '67 Chevy Impala.                           SHARON             That's what I said.                                                 (CONTINUED)                                                       3.CONTINUED:                           ROBBY             Needs a servicing.                             SHARON             Don't we all.Robby nearly spits his coffee, laughing at what Sharonhas said and trying not to choke. Sharon smiles, shakingher head.                           SHARON             Get it together, officer.As Robby smiles, Sharon looks ahead at the young couplewho each have an arm around the other. She is strokinghis neck. He is making gentle circles in her hair.Sharon watches this, and for a moment her eyes reveal adepth that may be loneliness, but she quickly pushes herthoughts away and hits the HORN, startling Robby andstartling the people ahead who now disengage and driveon.                            ROBBY             Jesus, Pogo! Almost spilled my             coffee again! You didn't like his             hair, or what?                        SHARON          I love Elvis hair. They were          going two damn miles an hour.But Robby's eyes have caught something on the monitor.                        ROBBY          Let's roll to this -- fight in          progress.As Robby secures that coffee cup, Sharon hits the SIRENand speeds around the car in front of them.EXT. CITY STREET - DAYAt the same time, a few blocks away, an OLD, FRAIL MAN iscarrying two plastic grocery bags that are too heavy forhim.Walking behind this man is a younger man named CATCHLAMBERT, an attractive man with some scarring on hisface. His eyes, deep down, are haunted by something, butthere is energy in his step. He is dressed in a relaxedand stylish manner, not expensive. He begins to pick uphis pace to catch up to the old man.                                             (CONTINUED)                                                     4.CONTINUED:People glance at Catch, nad he glances back in an openand unflinching way, ready for anything, a smile, a nod,or -- because these are some of L.A.'s mean streets -- athreatening or taunting look. These he also meetsopenly, without a trace of fear. The man has beenthrough some kind of fire, and it has left him differentfrom us. Outside the usual boundaries.Catch walks beside the Old Man, glancing at him.Finally, the man glances back, wondering and suspicious,but Catch has a slight, disarming smile, open and honest.                           CATCH             Y'know... since we're both walking             the same way, I could take one of             those bags for you. That way, I             do some upper body work while I'm             walking along. Helps my back.             What d'you say?The Old Man trudges on, proud and suspicious, too.                           CATCH             Right now your mind's making             pictures of me robbing your             groceires, but, y'know, nine times             out of ten, people do the right             thing.The Old Man glances at him, still not convinced, but hesoon has to stop and rest. Catch stops, too. The oldman looks at him, a bit embarrassed.                           OLD MAN             It's the dog food that makes it so             heavy.Catch nods, puts out his hand. The Old Man hesitates,then decides and lifts a bag, and Catch takes it.                           CATCH             I guess it's worth it... for a             good dog.Catch isn't kidding. He has that honesty. The Old Mannods and starts trudging again. As they walk ontogether, Catch reaches for that second bag. The manrelents and lets him take it. They continue on, Catchcarrying the bags and every now and then lifting them abit for his upper body work.                                                          5.EXT. VIDEO GAME ROOM - DAYThis is the call Sharon and Robby have sped to. It is achaotic scene of cops breaking up a fight between eightboys, 16-20. A big KID, 18 or so, is being pulled offanother by Sharon and Robby. The Kid is wild andresisting and Sharon shows her toughness andprofessionalism and some anger, too, as she slams himinto a fence -- and Robby holds him while she cuffs theyoung man -- who is very mouthy, playing to his friends.                        KID          Look at this bitch.    Whoo!   Benny,          look at this!Sharon and Robby are both very good at their jobs, takingthis Kid to their car while other cops contain the rest.A crowd watches -- mostly teens.                        KID                 (to Sharon)          You come in with me.    Hey, bitch.Some of his bystanders friends howl at that.                        KID          You're going to arrest me, you          come into the back seat with me.          Come on!He resists a bit, but they're getting him into the car.

ROBBY          Give it a rest!Sharon is stone-faced through this.

JAIL BOOKING AREA - DAYAs Robby and Sharon bring their suspect to the bookingcounter, each holding one of his cuffed arms. The Kid islooking at Sharon's hand on his arm.                           KID             That ain't the touch.   That ain't             the touch I want.They get him to the counter.                           ROBBY             As I remove your cuffs, I want you             to put your hands here. Spread             your legs. More.As they remove the cuffs, the Kid makes a sudden movetoward Sharon, reaching between her legs -- but she wasnot only ready for this, but hoping for it -- and thestoniness of her face cracks into fierce anger as shemoves quickly and grabs the Kid by the hair, bringing hisface into her upraised knee. He cries out and goes downon his knees, hurting and bleeding. The jailer rushesover to help, but Robby grabs the Kid's wrists.                            ROBBY             That's it.   Back off, John, we got             it.Robby glances at Sharon -- a dark glance.EXT. POLICE JAIL PARKING LOT - DAY (LATER)as Robby and Sharon walk to their car. They areinterrupted by one of their lieutenants, SANDERMAN,walking their way and stopping to stare at Sharon. Shemeets his look.                           SANDERMAN             You trying to be a bad-ass, Pogue?She is straightforward, not rebellious.                           SHARON             I just dealt with the situation.

(pause)             I want you to keep yourself way             inside the line instead of walking             on it. All right? Are you taking             notes?He walks away, and Sharon and Robby walk on to theircar -- she is dark; he is glancing at her.                           ROBBY             You broke his nose.                              SHARON             He grabbed me.     End of story.                           ROBBY             And you were waiting for him. You             were hoping. You were making             long-range plans for his ass while             he was mouthing off in the car --             and you're supposed to be above             that shit.                           SHARON             If you think I crossed the line,             put it in the report.                           ROBBY             Pogo, stop the shit. What is it?             You pissed off at me, too?They enter the car, Sharon behind the wheel.                        SHARON          Not you, Rob. You're a rare          unthreatened male cop with a good          marriage, and you like to eat          where I eat -- so everything's          code four.She STARTS the CAR and starts to back out, and he reachesover and turns OFF the IGNITION. She stares hotly athim -- but then, slowly, she softens, takes a deepbreath.                            ROBBY          Come over    for dinner tonight.          I'll call    Charlene. She'd like to          see you.     It's been awhile. We'll          talk about    it.

SHARON             Thanks. But  she'll invite             friends, try and fix me up. She's             always trying to fix me up so she             doesn't have to worry about you             and me.                           ROBBY             She doesn't worry about that.                           SHARON             They all worry about that.They both smile wryly, driving on.                           SHARON             You don't need to fix me, Robby,             or fix me up. I don't want some             guy to heart and soul me and then             walk away 'cause he can't stand             the cop thing -- or worse: he             wants cop stories every night             'cause it turns him on, and he has             no idea who I am inside my head.             Anyway, I'm busy tonight.                           ROBBY             Got some action, huh?    Well,             that's promising.                            SHARON             Yeah.   Hot and heavy.                                              IMMEDIATE CUT TO:INT. SHARON'S APARTMENT - NIGHTShe is on the floor using an exercise rig, sliding intocrunches, pushing herself, sweating, alone. We BEGINDRIFTING TO the rain-spattered window as night soundsfilter in, HORNS, SOMEONE SHOUTING, a CAR MOVING BY withTHUNDEROUS BASS MUSIC that pulses the very air andRATTLES the LOOSE GLASS of her window.EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREETS - NIGHTCatch Lambert is walking the wet streets, head down inthe rain. Far away we hear that car with a BASS-BLASTINGRADIO.                                                 (CONTINUED)                                                       9.CONTINUED:In the glow of a street lamp, Catch sees a bright-coloredobject in the gutter. He picks it up out of the gurglingrain water. It is a small toy, a discarded superhero.He puts it in his pocket, walks on.Now the car, the prowling, MUSIC-BLASTING, BASS-THUNDERING CAR turns a corner and begins rollling alongslowly -- beside Catch. He glances over, walking on.There are four tough-looking MEN in the car, looking fortrouble. The MUSIC is DEAFENING. Catch glances again,walks on. Their eyes follow him like gun barrels. Hestops and walks out on the street, moving toward the car,shouting over the music.                          CATCH             Hey! You want to turn that volume             down? What's your point?The men, incredulous, stop the car and snap OFF the MUSICin order to make sure they're hearing right. They staredeath at Catch.                           DRIVER (MAN)             What did you say?                           CATCH             What's the point of blasting your             music through the whole zip code?             Don't you realize there are kids             trying to sleep in these             apartments -- old people, sick             people?They can hardly believe this.                           DRIVER             You better watch your mouth,             asshole.Catch meets the man's look with his own unflinching,haunted eyes.                            CATCH             Why?   What're you gonna do?   Kill             me?Catch's look is not a macho challenge. It's somethingelse -- beyond that, a man somehow without limits. Oneof the riders in the backseat taps the Driver's shoulder.                            MAN #2             Guy's nuts.   Let's go.The Driver, never breaking his death stare, snaps on theDEAFENING MUSIC and then slowly rolls on, still glaringat Catch. Catch stands in the rain, watching them go.                                                       10.INT. CATCH'S APARTMENT CORRIDOR - SAME NIGHTCatch is arriving home, soaking wet. He lives in aslightly-seedy three-story. As he walks down thecorridor toward his apaprtment, he passes a neighbor'sdoor and notices a set of keys dangling from the lock.He pauses -- and then knocks softly on the door.Someone looks through the peephole and then opens thedoor -- a young single mother, friendly but with a littlecaution, too. She recognizes Catch. Behind her is alittle boy, (five). The woman's name is CANDACE. Herson is TOMMY.                         CANDACE          Hi.                         CATCH          Hi.   Your keys are in the...He gestures, and she sees the keys and retrieves them,more friendly now.                        CANDACE          Oh, thank you. Thanks a lot.          God. I was trying to carry Tommy          and all these bags. He was so          tired. Of course, as soon as I          put him down he had all this          energy...While she is talking, Catch is staring deeply at the boy,who is shy. Catch almost speaks to the boy, wants to,goes halfway to a smile -- but the sight of the kid stirsthat layer of darkness in Catch. He nods a good-bye tothe mother and is about to go. She thinks about this, ashe is turning, and pushes through her remaining cautionto say...                        CANDACE          Y'know, we were just baking          nectarine bars because the peaches          weren't ripe. Ever had a          nectarine bar?He smiles and seems to want to stay, but he is alreadyretreating. His contact goes only so far -- and nofurther.                         CATCH          Sorry.   Gotta be going.And with one more glance at the boy, he walks to hisapartment, unlocks it and steps in.                                                      11.INT. CATCH'S APARTMENT - NIGHTHe walks into a bare living room -- no chairs, tables,lamps, nothing on the walls. He walks into a spotless,never-used kitchen and flips on the light, opens adrawer.In the drawer is a collection of kids' toys, some found,some purchased, mostly plastic figures. The action ofopening the door has started some battery-operatedanimals moving around in there. Now from his pocket hetakes the plastic superhero he just found and drops it inand closes the drawer.He walks back into the living room.

Her touch is electric to him. She isgoing in for a kiss, and he is retreating. They stare amoment -- and then he suddenly takes her shoulders andlets loose his own longing. It is a hungry andpassionate kiss, and in the very midst of it, he breaksoff and pulls back, his darkness rushing at him.

He startsslowly toward her ear -- but she shakes her head. Hershirt is out of her belt and her midriff bare, and hestarts to move there, but checks her with a look. Sheshakes her head. He hunts. Her smile deepens a bit. Hetakes her hand and turns it over, going for the softflesh on the underside of her forearm, and she closes hereyes. He kisses her there softly, and then again, andthen he lavishes kisses from her wrist to the undersideof her elbow as she sighs with pleasure and draws up herknees in a kind of sensual glow that is leading themto...

He strokes her hair, her scalp as she closes hereyes and sighs, slowly moving toward sleep.

Juliette and             Sanchez had these four guys             against a wall, but they were             H.D.B. and definitely unco-op. It             got pretty jumpy, but we got them             in the car with a couple of             bruises and Robby got a sprained             wrist, so I did the rest of the             shift with a rookie who lost it             over a D.B. in Sunset Park, old             woman who'd been dead maybe six,             seven days, and I usually do all             right but the smell got to me, and             I can still smell her. Then we             arrested a prostitute working out             of her home, and I carried her             little girl out to the social             worker, and the kid was holding on             real tight and making my shoulder             wet and I wanted to punch her             rock-head mother, and then shift             ended and I had a nice visit with             my brother Larry.He is staring at her.

He kisses her again. She opens her eyes.They stare at each other. She raises a limp hand andtouches his face. He begins to come close, slowly, foranother kiss. She welcomes it. They kiss on the mouth,very tenderly. They kiss again -- deeper. They kissagain, and she holds him, and he moves fully onto thebed, lying over her and supporting his weight on hiselbows and kissing and kissing and letting go for once,hungry for her because she is in his heart now, and sheis a salvation, and there is a moment when they bothpause and stare clear-eyed, acknowledging what they aredoing, and both of them abandon their fear and pain andbegin to smile, and they make love that way, smiling, aswe slowly...

He made a wall             -- around that whole day, that             night -- other things, too. He             keeps them behind the wall -- his             little boy, my daughter. He can't             help it. The cemetery?! Do you             know how hard it is for me to go             to the cemetery? Can you imagine?Sharon is shaken by this, realizing, crumbling a bit asMrs. Chu goes on.                           ELANORA             That's where it stares you in the             face -- the loss. And it's too             much sometimes.Elanora takes a breath, acknowledging how upset she is.                           ELANORA             See? I'm still finding my way             through it. And Catch -- it             almost kills him to think about it             or say it or drive a car or see             the place where it happened or...             go by the cemetery.                           SHARON             I was trying to help him... come             back to some kind of life. I...                           ELANORA             But he was coming back. Do you             realize how much he changed in the             past weeks? His apartment, his             life, his music is coming back.             He fell in love! He even got a             job, Sharon -- for you. For the             two of you. Isn't that coming             back? Why do you have to rush?             Everybody has to rush these days.Sharon, battered by the truth of this, is totally exposednow, realizing, admitting.                           SHARON             I was scared. I push so hard...             when I'm scared.                           ELANORA             Scared of what?

I... I             didn't know what I was doing.Elanora sighs, looking at her, and her anger drains away,studying Sharon's misery.                           ELANORA             You were finding your way.    What             else can we do? You think    I'm             always sure what to say to   him,             what not to say? I do what    I             think is right and hope he   sees             the love in it.She shakes her head at Sharon's tears, her warmth showingnow, liking this girl.                           ELANORA             Look at you -- so worried now, so             miserable. That's the love in it.                           SHARON             Did I... make it worse for him?                           ELANORA             I don't know. I really don't.             But I think he'll see the love in             what you did.Sharon stares, without much hope. She puts out her handto touch Elanora's, to say goodbye. Elanora takes herhand and holds on a moment, staring into the girl, withstrength. Sharon nods and walks off, dark and sad.Elanora watches her go.INT. SHARON'S APARTMENT - DAYIt's the next day, and Sharon is preparing to go to herparents' renewal of vows. She is at the bottom -- withCatch gone from her life -- but she is doing her best togo through with this.We START ON a table, looking at the invitation and nextto that is a wrapped gift. We hear Sharon moving about,see her nervous, half-dressed, speaking to herself. Inthe b.g. we hear our TRUMPET-BASED MUSIC. Very soulful.

There isno one else outside the church. The ceremony has alreadybegun. She's planned it that way. She enters the churchas the MUSIC FADES OUT.INT. CHURCH - DAYAs Sharon comes in quietly. The church is not full, butperhaps 50 people sit in the front pews, watching theceremony at the altar: The priest, Mr. and Mrs. Pogue,altar boys. Sharon moves forward and slips into a pew afew back from the altar. The slight disturbance ofpeople sliding over to let her in causes a few people toglance over.

They trade a brief, nervous nod.Then Kathy whispers to her husband...                           KATHY             She came.We see Larry grow tense and angry.                           KATHY             Don't say anything.   Think of your             parents.Larry doesn't look at Sharon.

She winks, thensettles back in her pew, watches.ON ALTARWe get our first   look at Sharon's FATHER, Carl Pogue, 62.Standing beside   his wife, a rather big, stolid guy, takenwith the moment,   both he and his wife emotional overthis. He wears    a hearing aid. The priest is speaking.ON SHARONwatching with a mix of feelings as the mass continues andthe vows are renewed, the priest reciting the rituals.EXT. STREET - DAYThe PRIEST'S VOICE from the church plays over this scene,invoking the blessings, saying the prayers of the mass aswe watch Catch continuing his mission, slowing his stepsnow and pausing at the entrance to the Welston MemorialChapel. He hesitates. We see the price he's paying andthe determination. He walks through the gate.EXT. CHAPEL GROUNDS - DAYHe walks into a courtyard of several small buildings in agarden setting -- all red brick and ivy, fountains andflowers. He is fighting his way through this, movingcloser to one of the buildings. He is nearly alone onthe chapel grounds, and, as he reaches the sheltered wallof this building, he is alone.

His breath shivers inhis body as he   struggles to lift his eyes. Slowly, hisgaze comes to   rest on a name: "LAMBERT."As he stares, the PRIEST'S VOICE from Sharon's churchFADES OUT, and we are left with silence. Catch isshaky,. He takes a step closer to the wall, to the name,to them -- and he tries to speak, but can't. He triesagain -- his voice intimate, just above a whisper atfirst.                            CATCH             Annie. Chet. I don't... want you             to think I forgot about you. It's             just that I... I couldn't find             you.                    (pause)             I woke up, and you were gone.             Everything was gone. It all             just... disappeared. In one             minute. I couldn't remember that             minute. I lost it. It took me so             long to find it. I think I found             it all now. I used a calculator.             I did. I figured it out. You             know... we get about 1400 minutes             a day and so I figured it out. I             was 33 years old and three months             and eight days, so it was... I've             got it here...He fishes a piece of paper out of his pocket. His handis shaking as he reads a number off the paper.

CATCH             That's the one I lost. And...             when I lost that minute, I guess I             tried to lose it all, all the             memories -- because they hurt. I             tried, but... I couldn't do it.We --                                                         116.FLASHBACK - INT. VANto that minute and, for once, we go in order and     play outeach piece of it. We see Catch driving the van,      his wifeANNIE beside him. His son Chet is in back with      hisgrandparents, Elanora and her husband. The boy      is a bitwhiny, pouty.We INTERCUT the flashback WITH --CATCHat the grave, struggling through this.                          CATCH            Chet... you weren't feeling so            good, remember? It was your            birthday, and you ate too much.We see   Annie and Catch both glance back toward Chet, andwe get   present sound in this FLASHBACK scene as Catch andAnnie   both say, "What's the matter? Hm? Aww." And thenAnnie   looks out the window and turns to Catch and -- weCUT TO   Catch at the grave, his eyes filling.                          CATCH            And, Annie, you said... you            said...In the FLASHBACK we see Annie turn to him again, and thistime we hear her say, softly...                          ANNIE            Slow down in the rain, all right?We GO TO Catch at the grave, fighting tears.                          CATCH            And I don't know if I slowed down.            I don't know. I hope I did,            but... I didn't always listen. I'm            sorry. I'm really sorry.Back in the FLASHBACK, we see Annie reach around asElanora hands Chet to her. Then we're BACK at the graveand INTERCUTTING so that we see Catch speaking throughhis tears and we also see this tender moment played outin the van.                          CATCH            ... You put him on your lap, and            he looked at me, and I made a            face. Remember? I made you            smile, Chet.

It was. I'm             really glad... I found that             minute. No matter what.Catch stares at the grave, in tears, as the rest of thatminute now plays out, punishing him. It lasts only aboutthree seconds: a bus out of control, headlights suddenlyglaring through the windshield, Catch turning the wheel,BRAKES SCREAMING, PEOPLE SCREAMING -- and then it's over.And Catch has been battered by the memory, and isweeping, but has not looked away. He is still staring atthe name of his family, and he is able to say, in abroken voice...                           CATCH             I won't forget... anymore.     I love             you.He steps forward and puts his hand on the plaque, restsit there. We STAY ON this, then in a moment, we...                                                 DISSOLVE TO:INT.

Now and then anervous glance from her mother is directed at Sharon, ora hostile glance from Larry.Sharon passes the videographer, who is pointing light,camera and microphone at the Vanders -- having them puttheir good wishes on tape. She smiles, then looks overand sees her Father across the room. He is alone. Shesteels herself and heads his way. He makes eye contact,then averts his look. She is approaching him, about tospeak, when he walks up to some friends and starts jokingwith them, leaving Sharon hurt, humiliated.Her mother has seen this and comes to her, speakingquietly, nervously.
