JACK'S OFFICE - DAY - THAT MOMENTJack and the Colonel are sitting, drinks in their hand. The Colonel smokesa cigar.                                    JACK                   The idea is this: Amber is a director                 of porno films and she's down on her luck.                   She hasn't had a hit in a year. She's             desperate. Her landlord is threatening to kick her             out, so she's desperate for a big dick hit, right?                                  COLONEL                             Yes. Good dilemma.                                    JACK                   Yes. So she calls up all the agencies                   in town and says: "Send over your best                   actors, I'm casting a porno picture."                   Well, the story goes and develops with                     Amber auditioning various men and                 women . . . the whole thing wraps up with                  the Landlord, I'd like to get Jeremy if                   he's still in town to play the part --                     he comes in -- the landlord says:                   You better pay rent or you're through.                   Well, Amber does one helluva suck job,                 ass fuck, come in the face, sort of thing                          and fade out - the end.                                  COLONEL                               That's great.

JACK                          This would be his first.Little Bill pokes his head into the office, sees the conversation andquickly apologizes and exits. The Colonel looks to Jack;                                  COLONEL                Casting is up to you, Jack. You wanna do it?                Then do it.

FLOYD                   . . . so let's talk about the future.                    So let's talk about what video means                     to this industry -- and let's talk                  about how all of us -- not one of us --                 but all of us will profit. I've been doing                theater work in San Francisco and San Diego                   for as long as you've been doing stag                            and hardcore, Jack.                                    JACK                       I know you're history, Floyd.                                  COLONEL                       No one's doubting your history                        or your credentials, Floyd.                                   FLOYD                      Then why the resistance? I mean:                    This industry is going to be turned                         upside down soon enough --                                    JACK                             Then why help it?                                   FLOYD                    Why not be prepared? The money comes                  from the Colonel, the talent comes from                  you, Jack. I've got a connection to the                 equipment and the mail order distribution,                 not to mention those kids I got out there                    who are hot-fuck-action to the max.              This is the future. Video tape tells the truth.                                    JACK                  I have a stable of actors and actresses.                     They're professionals. They're not                    a bunch of fucking amateurs. They're                   proven box office and they get people                  in theaters (where films should be seen)                     and they know how to fuck well --                                   FLOYD                       That's right, Jack and by that                    same token, you're the one with the                      power here. The video revolution                  is upon us -- and our role is critical.                 We have an obligation to use our resources                     and talent to help make it fly --                                    JACK                You come in here, at my party, tell me about                 this and that -- tell me about the future,                  tell me about -- video and amateurs and               all that -- well lemme tell you something now:                   I will not shoot films on video and no                   I will not loan out my actors who are                       under contract to me. Period.                                   FLOYD              Wait a minute, Jack. I'm not a complicated man.                  I like cinema. In particular, I like to                  see fucking on film. I don't want to win                 an Oscar and I don't want to re-invent the               wheel -- I enjoy simple pleasures like butter                    in my ass and lollipops in my mouth.               That's me -- call me crazy, call me a pervert,                  but this is something I enjoy. One other               small thing I want to do in this life is make              a dollar and a cent in this business -- I'm not              trying to hurt you. I'm trying to help you stay                       one step ahead of the game --                                    JACK                   We're repeating ourselves now, Floyd.                                  COLONEL               Jack, I think this is about cost and future --                                    JACK                  The future is as bright as we make it --                it shouldn't be sacrificed for a few dollars                that can be saved shooting on video tape --                if it looks like shit and sounds like shit,                           it probably is shit --                                   FLOYD              I think you're one gin past this conversation --                                    JACK                    No . . . no. I'm crystal clear here.                                  COLONEL                    Jack, please understand that this is                 not an argument . . . this is a fact of --                                    JACK                             . . .

COLONEL                      What do you mean, Jack, c'mon --                                    JACK                       Are you telling me that you're                          working with this shit?                                  COLONEL                    I think that there is a serious case                  to be made for the price and the gamble                on the whole idea of a home video market --                Jack: Two, three years from now, everyone's                   gonna be able to walk into their local               supermarket and buy or rent a videocassette --                                    JACK                   True film fans won't watch that shit.                 It doesn't look good and more importantly                       it doesn't make sex look sexy.                                  COLONEL                    It doesn't have to look good, Jack.                      Film is just too damn expensive.                     The theaters are already planning                      converting to video projectors.                                    JACK                           I haven't heard that.                                   FLOYD                                 It's true.                                    JACK                    We've got ten minutes until the New                Year and I don't want it to start like this                  so I'm leaving now. We will or we won't                continue this conversation some other time.Jack leaves. Floyd looks to the Colonel. HOLD.CUT TO:92 INT. AMBER'S BEDROOM - NIGHTDirk and Amber enter.

Something to help us score a little extra cash.                 I think if we decide to do this, we gotta                          be one hundred percent.                                    REED                                  I agree.                                    TODD                     This guy's name is Rahad Jackson.                   He's got more money than God and twice                  as much coke, crack and smack. He'll buy               just about anything anybody wants to sell him.               He just likes people hanging out at his house                               and partying.                                    DIRK                            How do you know him?                                    TODD                      He used to come into Party Boys                  once in a while. Mutrix introduced me --                                    DIRK                      And how would we do it, exactly?                     I mean, how would it all go down?                                    TODD                       It's like this: I call him up,                tell him I got half a key of quality stuff.                                    REED                       Do you have his phone number?                                    TODD                Yeah. So we call him up, give him the price.                                    DIRK                                 How much?                                    TODD               Half a key for like . . . five thousand bucks.                           Split it three ways --                                    DIRK                    That's enough to get my Vette fixed.                                    TODD                    That's right. So we set up the deal,                    dump half a kilo of baking soda in a                  bag and walk over to his house -- BOOM.
