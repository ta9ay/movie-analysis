ARCADE WORLD -- ELECTRONIC DARKNESSWe don't know if it's night or day.  It's just black.And maybe...maybe intermittent SPARKS racing by.  So quick we barelyperceive them.  Like the sparks you imagine when your eyes are closed.BREATHING,slow and hollow, filling up the entire world.  It's eerie as hell.  Afeeling of utter loneliness.And now the breathing recedes, fading into the darkness.  Whatever itwas...it's gone now.MAIN CREDITS ROLL.We hear CELLOS.  Four of them.  Weaving an intricate melody.And now the visuals.  BRIGHTLY COLORED SHAPES spinning in.  Equallyintricate, matching the music.  They grow and flourish, like flowersopening up in time lapse photography.FRACTALS...is what they're called.  The visual manifestation of geometric formulas.The Mandelbrot Set.  The Julia Set.  Each mathematic form made up ofprogressively smaller forms and on into infinity.Glorious and beautiful.  Forms folding in upon themselves andregenerating.This is creation we're witnessing.This is life in the making.							DISSOLVE TO:INT. COUNSELOR'S OFFICE -- DAYAN EYEFor a brief moment we still hear the CELLOS.  And in the eye, the last ofthe fractals are spinning away, leaving us with the iris.  A nice blueone.  This is ALEX MANNING'S eye.				ALEX (V.O.)		Time.  That's all I ever think about		anymore.  It's like there's never enough of		it, you know?								CUT TO:INT.  MANNING HOUSE, HALLWAY -- DAYThis is a flashback, in case you're wondering.  We'll continue to hearAlex's VOICE as we move through the house in slow motion.  Everything isvery bright and dreamlike.Right now we're moving with the camera, slowly moving down a long hallway.At the end of the hallway is an open door.We stop at the doorway.  We're afraid to go in.				ALEX (V.O.)		It's strange.  When the future's in front		of you, it seems to go on forever.  I mean,		you never really get there.  It's always		one step ahead of you.  It's like there's		no present. There's no "now".  As soon as		you think, "I'm here", the moment's already		gone.  Either everything's in the future,		or it's in the past.			(beat)		There's no "now".				MAN (V.O.)		So where are you then?				ALEX (V.O.)		I'm in the past.We move through the doorway.INT.  MANNING HOUSE, BEDROOM -- DAYEverything looks normal at first.  A typical bedroom with sunlightstreaming in through the windows.  A bed, made-up. Flowers in vases.Everything looks perfect.Then we move further in, and over to the right.  There's something on thefloor, curled up in the entranceway to the bathroom.  Halfway in, halfwayout.It's a woman's body.  She's wearing a dress, her legs awkwardly bent.  Wecan't see her face from this angle. But in her limp hand is a gun.  Andall around that hand, speckling the pristine white tile of the bathroomand the carpeting beyond, is BLOOD.A shrill BELL shatters the moment.								CUT TO:INT.  COUNSELOR'S OFFICE -- DAYThe bell continues.  It's a school bell signaling the end of the period.ON ALEXas we see her for the first time, startled.  She's seventeen and pretty,though in a simple way.  Her eyes are the most striking.  Deep.  Intense.If Alex has a problem, it's the fact that she thinks too much, and it'sreflected in her eyes.Across from her is MR. WEAVER, a high-school guidance counselor and thatwas his voice we heard with Alex's. He's unexceptional, middle-aged,incapable of really hearing what Alex has to say.  This is his officewe're in. Typical "SAY NO TO DRUGS" teen propaganda decorate the room.Fun.As the BELL dies we hear the army of FOOTSTEPS outside, students millingin the halls.Alex glances at the door and starts to rise from her chair.				MR. WEAVER		We don't have to stop now...				ALEX			(cutting him off)		That's okay.  I've got a test coming up		anyway.  Gotta study.				MR. WEAVER			(sighs)		I have to tell you, I'm a little concerned		about you, Alex.  It's been three months		now since your mother, uh...				ALEX			(offering, fixing him with			a stare)		Killed herself?Mr. Weaver stops, more than a little uncomfortable.				MR. WEAVER			(reluctant)		Yes.  Now your father...				ALEX		He's a basket case.  You've talked to him.		You know that.  He might as well be dead		too.Alex glances down at the floor, anything to avoid looking at thecounselor.  She heaves a backpack onto to shoulder.				ALEX			(continuing)		Look Mr. Weaver, I don't even know why I		came here.  I fine.  Really.			(looking up)		It's like I said.  It's just part of the		past now.  It doesn't matter anymore.She turns, and before Mr. Weaver can respond, she's out the door.INT.  HIGH-SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAYAlex moves quickly through the mass of STUDENTS, wiping the remnants ofhalf-tears on her coat sleeve.								CUT TO:INT.  HIGH-SCHOOL CAFETERIA - DAYFun-time.  Total chaos.  If you've been to high-school you know the riff.Bad food, teen-age melodrama, and a squadron of SUPERVISORS trying to keepa lid on things.ALEXmakes her way to the far corner of the cafeteria where a cluster of kidslounge around a table.  These are Alex's FRIENDS.  And while none of themare your garden variety pocket-protector-type nerds, these kids aren'texactly part of the "in-crowd".  They're a little off.  Quirky.  All ofthem come from screwed up families, and that's what bonds them.  They are:GREG HOLLISTON -- Alex's boyfriend.  Hopeful artist (not bad, either) andkind of punk looking.  Greg and the others are big fans of thrift-shopclothing.  Because they don't have the money, they improvise.NICK DRAKE -- Greg's best friend and future computer pioneer.  He'sattractive and he's got an edge.  A bit of a hot-shot.  Genius in themaking.BENZ AND STILTS -- Inseparable.  Benz is flunking out of school and wouldlike nothing better than to spend the rest of his life reading comicbooks.  He's tall, perpetually unkempt, awkward, and nervous.  Stilts,contrary to his nickname, is quite short and never without his skateboard.Stilts is constantly hitting on...LAURIE -- The sixth member of the group.  A teen Theda Bara and as cynicalas you can get.  She's what's affectionately known as an "art chick".The boys in the group, particularly Nick and Stilts, are avidskateboarders and are frequently seen with their boards.  Stilts is alwaysleafing through an issue of THRASHER magazine.Right now the group is in the midst of an argument.  Nick has a pocketvideo game in his hands which he casually plays.  He can get through thesegames in his sleep.  It BEEPS and WHIRS.				NICK			(to Benz)		You're an idiot, you know that? What're you		going to do when you get out of here?				BENZ		I was thinking about writing for one of		those Filipino mail order brides...Stilts and Greg burst into laughter.				STILTS		I think I saw that on the Home Shopping		Network.  The Girlfriend Hour, right after		Auto Accessories.				BENZ			(giggling)		Exactly.				LAURIE		You guys are sick.Alex flops down in a chair and everyone turns.				GREG		So how'd it go?Alex shrugs, trying to make light of it.				ALEX		He thinks I'm "sublimating".				STILTS		What the hell does that mean?				LAURIE		It means she's screwed up.				STILTS		Fucked up.  That's what they said I was.				BENZ		You are fucked up.				STILTS		Yeah, but only because I want to be.				GREG		Would you guys knock it off?Greg turns back to Alex and looks her in the eye.				GREG			(continuing)		Listen to me, Alex.  These counselor's		don't know anything.  They're full of shit.		If you don't fit the pattern of the perfect		kid, they freak.				ALEX			(nodding)		I know.				GREG		So tell me you're okay, then.				ALEX		I'm okay.				GREG			(smiles)		Good.   Cause I'd freak if you weren't.Greg leans over and kisses Alex.  The rest of the group launches intoexaggerated GROANS, with Benz and Stilts fluttering their eyes and making"smooching faces" at each other.  The kiss is over and everyone LAUGHS.Things are okay now.				GREG			(to Alex)		Hey...watch this...Greg pulls an old Polaroid camera from his backpack.  He leans in close toher and holds the camera at arm's length, aiming it back at them.  FLASH!And the moment's captured forever.Greg pulls the Polaroid out and peels off the backing. Before the pictureeven develops, he begins rubbing his fingers over it, manipulating theemulsion.				NICK			(engrossed in his game			again)		You making another one, Greg?				GREG		Sure.  Practice.				BENZ		Lemme see...Greg pulls some papers from his backpack and slides them over to Benz.The papers are color xeroxes of Polaroid blow-ups.  Greg has messed withthem, creating swirling, psychedelic patterns with the images.  Stilts andLaurie lean in.				STILTS		Cool.				GREG			(still working)		See, when the emulsion's still warm you can		move it around...			(stops)		There.Greg holds up the Polaroid for Alex to see.POLAROIDGreg and Alex are side by side, grinning...all around them the world hasspun into strange colors.  It's an odd effect.Greg drops the photo in his shirt pocket and pats it.				GREG		Safe keeping.Meanwhile, Nick's pocket video game emits an EXPLOSION NOISE.				NICK		Shit.  I'm out.He sets the game down, dejected.				BENZ		You guys going to Dante's after school?				GREG		I don't know.				BENZ		Check it out...Benz pulls a flyer from inside his coat.  It's an ad for a new game called"ARCADE", featuring a pair of evil eyes and glowing hands coming out of acircuit board.  The tag at the bottom reads, "COMING THIS FALL.  REALITYWILL NEVER BE THE SAME".				NICK			(excited)		That's the new Slip-Stream game. Those guys		are good.  It's supposed to be interactive.		Graphics are unbelievable.				BENZ		Yeah?  They were handing these out at		Dante's.  Test marketing it or something.		Gonna have a demonstration today.				STILTS		Cool.				LAURIE		Can you say anything but "cool"?				STILTS		Of course I can.  I can say all sorts of		things...				GREG			(annoyed)		Guys...Benz pulls back the flyer and looks at it again.				BENZ		So how 'bout it?				NICK		I'm game...			(to Greg)		Greg?Greg turns to Alex.				GREG		Come on.  We'll hit Dante's after school,		try the game out, maybe get some dinner.				ALEX		And then keep on driving?				GREG		Sure.  Never come back.  Disappear forever.				LAURIE			(nodding)		I could go for that.Alex laughs.  Laurie took the words right out of her mouth.								CUT TO:EXT.  DANTE'S INFERNO -- DAYThe Inferno is a run-down video arcade near the beach, notable because thegames it sports are generally defective and out of date.  Nevertheless,it's become our group's hang-out.  It has its charms.A huge mural, chipped and faded with age, adorns the front of thearcade...something straight out of Hieronymus Bosch. Demons in day-glo.The yawning mouth of an enormous devil surrounds the entrance.ALEX AND THE OTHERSpull up across the street, caravan style.  Greg and Alex are in onecar...an ancient Buick Skylark.  No Honda Accords or VW Rabbits for thisgroup.At the moment, there's quite a bit of activity at the Inferno's entrance.KIDS are clustered around and Slip-Stream employees are passing out Arcadepromo sheets.THE GROUPheads for the entrance, plowing their way through the crowd.  Stilts andBenz have their skateboards, jumping up onto the curb with them, thenpopping them up into their arms.INT.  DANTE'S INFERNO -- DAYInside, the Inferno is a mishmash of video games, ancient carnival propsand old horror movie posters.  Dusty, creepy under the right circumstancesand filled with leering faces...  in short, any kid's bedroom taken to ahorrific extreme.  At Dante's Inferno, they've got the latest games sideby side with chestnuts like Pac-Man.THE GROUPmakes their way inside, joining a cluster of KIDS in the center of TheInferno.  And there it is...ARCADEIt looks out of place in the midst of The Inferno.  Shiny black,high-tech, and almost self-contained, like some sort of space-age verticalcoffin.  Laser-etched graphics on the sides bear the ARCADE logo and thesame strange, frightening face.Alex and her friends are suitably impressed, most notably, Nick and Benz.				BENZ		Check it out...				STILTS		Definitely cool.Nick is silent, letting his eyes explore the machine.  He turns to Gregand grins.				NICK		Super computers, micro-processors... That's		the future we're looking at.Another kid, DELOACH, pushes his way to the front of the group.  Hisfighting a losing battle against acne.				DELOACH			(looking around)		So how come they're previewing it in this		shit-hole?				STILTS		If you weren't such a dick, you'd know what		a cool place this was.				DELOACH		Gimme a break, they got fucking Space		Invaders here.  That's shit's for retards.				STILTS		So...are you trying to say I'm retarded?		Is that what you're implying?				DELOACH		No, but since I'm standing here, I'm		noticing that you're an ugly little fuck		and you're making me sick...That's it for Stilts.  He launches himself at DeLoach, catching him offguard and KNOCKING him to the floor.Nick, Alex, and Greg are on them in a minute, trying to extract the twofrom each other.A LARGE MANpushes his way towards them and effortlessly scoops both boys up, wrappinga beefy hand around the scruffs of their necks.  This is FINSTER, theproprietor...enormous, bald, and always irritable.				FINSTER			(shaking them)		Cut it out!!!His face contorts and he spits as he speaks.  Nice guy. Alex stepsforward, always the voice of reason.				ALEX		It's okay, Mr. Finster...				FINSTER		No it's not.			(to the boys)		You guys are shits and I'm throwing you out.				DELOACH			(acting tough)		Your place sucks.  Who gives a shit about		"ARCADE" anyway?				VOICE (O.S.)			(booming, metallic)		WHAT DID YOU SAY?Everyone turns.  The voice came from...ARCADEIt's up and running now.  The inside panel emits an eerie green light.From speakers inside the compartment we can here BREATHING...the samebreathing we heard earlier. Coming from a machine like this, it's creepyas hell.Even Finster is impressed.  He releases the boys and stares at themachine.				LAURIE			(a whisper)		Jesus...				ANOTHER VOICE (O.S.)		Not bad, huh?A MAN steps out from behind the ARCADE machine.  He grins happily, dressedto kill, sporting a SLIP-STREAM ID tag. This is DIFFORD, P.R. man forSLIP-STREAM.				DIFFORD		Hi, kids.			(nods)		Mr. Finster...The ARCADE machine continues to breathe, inhale, exhale... The eyes in theface are glowing now, in unison with the breathing.Difford draws closer and indicates the machine behind him with a nod.				DIFFORD			(smooth as silk)		We're glad you people could make it, and		we're anxious to have you try out our new		product.  We think it's going to be a big		seller.  But you're the people that make it		happen.  You're the market share everyone's		tearing each other apart to get at.  It's		your opinion that's going to make or break		us.				NICK		So what's so different about Arcade? You		guys've been talking about it for months.Difford turns to Nick and salutes him.				DIFFORD		A man after my own heart.  Straight to the		point.			(to everyone)		What's different about ARCADE is the way it		reacts.  It responds like a human does.  It		learns.  It adapts. Each time you play, it		changes its strategy.				NICK		That's impossible.				DIFFORD			(taking the bait)		Is it?  Why don't you see for your self?Difford reaches into his coat pocket and pulls out a quarter.  He tossesit at...NICKwho snags it out of mid-air and grins.				GREG		Go for it, Nick.Difford steps aside and waves Nick to the machine.  The rest of the kidscrowd around.ARCADEisn't just your typical video game.  First of all there are threescreens...front, left, and right...which provide a panoramic view whileplaying.  Second, the player wears "data gloves" (which provide an actualsensation of touch) and stereoscopic goggles which in turn are wireddirectly into the machine.  The results give the user the feeling thathe/she has actually entered the video game universe.Difford thinks he has a hit on his hands, and his excitement shows.				DIFFORD			(indicating equipment)		The CyberGloves are keyed into the game's		response mechanism.  You'll be able to pick		things up inside the world...tools, weapons		... it'll feel like they're really in your		hands...Nick pulls on the gloves, securing them with velcro straps.				DIFFORD			(continuing)		The goggles heighten the experience. When		we said "Reality will never be the same",		we weren't kidding.Difford places the goggles on Nick's face.  Then he points to the controlboard, which features two joy-sticks and a large RED BUTTON labeled"ESCAPE".				NICK			(skeptical)		"Escape"?				DIFFORD		In case things get too intense.  It		automatically freezes the game, gives you a		breather.  Things can get pretty wild...				BENZ			(scoffing)		Nick won't need it.				DIFFORD		You're good, eh?				NICK			(grins)		The best.Nick winks at Alex and Greg.				NICK			(to Difford)		So what's the scenario?  Am I saving a		princess?  Fighting Zombies?				DIFFORD		It changes.  There are eleven levels. Each		one is a different layer of the ARCADE		universe.  The concept is, you're entering		the video game itself, making your way		across the circuit board to the logic core		... ARCADE's brain.				NICK		So how do I start?				DIFFORD		The game will guide you.Nick turns back to the machine and pops the quarter into the coin slot.He punches the "START" button on the top of one of the joy-sticks.Immediately the screens come to life.  Darkness with shooting stars oflight racing back and forth.ON SCREENA three-dimensional computer-generated FACE appears out of the darkness,spinning in from far away and coming to rest.				ARCADE		I AM ARCADE.			(breathing)		YOU WANT TO PLAY GAMES?  YOU PICKED THE		WRONG MACHINE.The crowd of kids is suitably impressed.  Even Alex is amused.So far, so good.				ARCADE		WHAT'S YOUR NAME?				NICK		Nick.				ARCADE			(almost contemptuous)		NICK.  KISS REALITY GOODBYE.SUDDENLY,A LIGHTBEAM above the video screen illuminates Nick's face.				LAURIE			(concerned)		What's it doing?!				DIFFORD		Memorizing Nick's features.  Watch.ON SCREENthe face of ARCADE spins away and a computer-generated figure appears,complete with a pixel-rendered version of Nick's face!VIDEO NICKis dressed in futuristic armor with exaggerated CyberGloves and a fullhelmet on instead of goggles.  He also wears elbow and knee pads andcarries a thrasher in his hands, sort of a cross between a souped-upskateboard and the Silver Surfer's board.  It's his means oftransportation.The screen prints out:  "NICK.  ENTER THE VORTEX".VIDEO NICKhops onto the thrasher.  Abruptly the world around him begins to spin, andVideo Nick is shooting a curl, a whirlpool of light...down, down, fasterand faster, until...BOOM!  Empty space and video Nick is falling towards a circuit grid.  It'sthe electronic universe rushing up to meet him...				ARCADE		ONE WORD OF ADVICE, NICK.  YOU SPEND TOO		MUCH TIME IN ONE PLACE, AND I SEND OUT THE		SCREAMER.  YOU DON'T WANT TO BE AROUND WHEN		THAT HAPPENS.			(laughs)		SEE YOU ON THE OTHER SIDE.ON SCREENVideo Nick plummets from the sky like a meteor, slamming into the groundwith an explosion of dust.  The dust clears.Video Nick is standing on an eerie plain, with strange reed-like plantsdotting the ground and mist coiling around everything.  It looks likeEarth, and yet...it doesn't.VIDEO NICKhops onto the thrasher and begins to move.  And move it does.  With aWHOOP! the ARCADE world is rushing past us. The game has begun.ON NICK'S FACEAs a smile gradually creeps across it.  He's having the time of his life,gloved hands manipulating the joy-sticks like mad.  From his reactions, wecan tell that this is one of the most incredible things he's everexperienced.THE OTHER KIDSwatch Nick, then the screen, then Nick again...				BENZ		Check it out!				GREG		Come on, Nick...Now everyone is laughing, urging Nick on.  It's like they've alldiscovered the most amazing toy...something that's going to turn theirworld upset down.DIFFORDis pleased as punch, watching the kids' reactions more than the game.ON SCREENImages are rushing past at blinding speed, LASERS, EXPLOSIONS, and godknows what...ON NICKAs sweat begins to trickle down his fast.  His hands move faster andfaster, in response to the game.The screen.Nick.The screen and...BAM!!!  Nick SLAMS down the escape button and rips off his goggles.  Thevideo image freezes.NICKHe's practically hyperventilating, sweat pouring down his face.  He leansover, resting a hand on the control board. And for a moment, everyone issilent.  Then...				GREG		Nick...you okay?Slowly, Nick lifts his head.  He's now sporting a devilish grin.				NICK		You gotta try this thing.Nick pulls off his CyberGloves and holds them out for Greg. Greg turns toAlex.				ALEX		Go for it.				GREG		Hold my keys, then.He hands her his keychain and takes the CyberGloves from Nick.  Greg pullsthem on, then straps on the goggles.				GREG			(to Difford)		So how do I get back in?				DIFFORD		Just hit "ESCAPE" again.ON SCREENGreg hits the button and immediately the image unfreezes. Once again,we're on the thrasher board, rushing across the plains.GREG'S FACEAs a smile slowly creeps across it.								CUT TO:INT. DANTE'S INFERNO - LATERAt the front of The Inferno, Difford and two SLIP-STREAM HELPERS areunpacking cardboard boxes.  The KIDS have clustered around them,momentarily forgetting the ARCADE machine.Difford pulls cut a handful of game cartridges as well as goggles whichdangle over his arm.				DIFFORD		Here's what we're going to do.  What I'm		holding are the home versions of ARCADE,		the prototypes...This is met with an enthusiastic response from the kids.				DIFFORD			(continuing)		In a month or so we're planning on releasing		ARCADE in both versions, but we're still		fine tuning, and that's where you guys luck		out.  So what we'll do is have you register		with us, and then we're going to loan these		out to you for a week or so.  The only thing		you have to do in return is answer some		marketing questions. Sound fair?The kids can't line up fast enough.OUR GROUPis right up front, with Nick and Alex being the first two in line.Difford winks at Nick.				DIFFORD		So what do you think?				NICK		Sign me up.Alex is glancing around now.  She sees Benz, Stilts, and Laurie, but notGreg.				ALEX		Where's Greg?Laurie jerks her thumb back at the ARCADE machine.				LAURIE		He's still working on the game.And Alex finds Greg for a moment, spotting him over the heads of the otherkids.ON GREGHis face is a mirror of Nick's...sweat pouring down, grinning from ear toear.  It's addictive as hell.  SIGHTS and SOUNDS rush past us on the threescreens, racing at incredible speeds.And now, from within the game, we hear a strange sound...a SCREAM ofsorts, halfway between a shriek and a sonic boom.				ARCADE		TIME'S UP, FRIEND.The SHRIEK/SONIC BOOM reaches a nightmarish pitch and suddenly the screensEXPLODE WITH LIGHT.AT THE FRONT OF THE INFERNO...everyone turns in response.  It's as if someone set off a flashbulb.ALEXpushes her way back through the kids, making her way to the ARCADEmachine.ARCADEGreg is nowhere to be found.  In fact, the CyberGloves and goggles aredangling from the control board, abandoned.Alex turns to a nearby KID.				ALEX		Where's Greg?The kid shrugs.				KID		Don't know.  I think I saw him walk out,		but I'm not sure...Alex isn't listening anymore.  She's staring at the floor of the ARCADEmachine.GREG'S POLAROIDis on the floor...the photo of Greg and Alex which he manipulated.Alex picks it up, glancing around.  She scans the faces of the crowd andshe doesn't see Greg anywhere.  She turns away.ON SCREENA video figure is lying on the computer-generated ground. It sits up,brushing dust from itself, and looks around. It faces us.  Only the imageisn't of Nick anymore.  It's VIDEO GREG now.UP FRONT,Alex has re-joined her friends.  The four of them are now clutching ARCADEhome versions in their arms, CyberGloves and all.  They look like kids onChristmas Day.				ALEX		Has anyone seen Greg?				STILTS		He's probably outside.  You know how he is.		Gets bored...				NICK		Yeah, outside.Nick heads for the door with the rest of the group in tow.								CUT TO:EXT.

ALEX		So where is he?				NICK		Guess he took off...  You have his keys,		right?Alex holds them up and gives them a shake.				NICK		Hmmm.  He said you were going to have		dinner?				ALEX		Yeah...				NICK		So take his car home.  Wait.  I'm sure he's		up to something...				ALEX			(cutting him off)		But he was playing the game.  I mean, you		saw him...BEHIND THEM,Laurie reaches over the seat and honks Nick's horn.  Laurie and the othersburst into LAUGHTER.  Stilts sets his skateboard on the street and rollsit towards Nick.BACK TO NICK AND ALEXNick stops the board with his foot and steps onto it, balancing.  He wavesto the others and turns back to Alex.				NICK		It's nothing, okay?  Just take his car home.		He'll show up.Nick tousles Alex's hair.  He shakes his ARCADE cartridge at her.				NICK		Don't worry about it.And with that, Nick's off, rolling back to his car and leaping over thedoor, skateboard and all.  Laurie and the others are still screaming withlaughter.Nick hits the ignition and guns the car, pulling out with a dramaticSCREECH and sailing off down the street.ON ALEXclutching Greg's car keys.  She glances on the front seat, where her ownARCADE cartridge rests.THE CARTRIDGEhas the same glowing eyes that were laser-etched on the machine inside TheInferno.				ALEX		Fuck-you.								CUT TO:EXT. MANNING HOUSE -- NIGHTThe Manning place is your basic suburban ranch house, totallyunexceptional.  The lawn looks a little ragged and a pile of newspapers,frayed and yellowing, have accumulated by the front door.  Inside, thehouse is dark. Lonely.ALEXpulls up in Greg's Skylark, scooping the ARCADE kit into her arms.								CUT TO:INT.  MANNING HOUSE -- NIGHTAs Alex enters the dark house, we can hear WHISPERS coming from furtherwithin.  It's a little creepy, but Alex seems unconcerned.She negotiates her way through the darkened house, on into the den.DEN -- FOLLOWING THROUGHDim, flickering LIGHT illuminates the den, casting long shadows across aSLEEPING FIGURE on the couch.This is Alex's father, JIM...hopelessly middle-aged and getting older bythe moment.  It's the t.v. that's doing the whispering.  CNN or something.From what little we can see of the rest of the house, it looks like amess.Alex bends down and jostles her father's shoulder.				ALEX		Dad...Dad...Jim stirs, though barely.  He turns a sleepy face towards her, lookinggray and lifeless.				JIM		Yeah?				ALEX		Did Greg call, Dad?Jim shakes his head and sinks back into the couch.From Alex's attitude, it's obvious that this scene has played itself outmany times before.				ALEX		You should go to bed, Dad.Jim waves a tired hand, dismissing her.				JIM		...am in bed...				ALEX			(standing back up)		Yeah.She turns and grabs a comforter that's bunched up at the end of the couch,spreading it over her father.ON THE T.V.We're getting a de-saturated view of carnage...some sort of war going onin some far-off land.Alex grabs the remote and flicks the t.v. off, plunging the room intodarkness.

She's fiddling with wires back there and...BLINK! Suddenly the SLIP-STREAM logo appears on the t.v. screen with niftycomputer graphics.  She's just hooked up the home version of ARCADE.  Alexmoves back to the front of the set.ALEX'S ROOMis her haven, a virtual library, filled with books which she loses herselfin.  They're stacked everywhere.And puzzles too.  Half-assembled jig-saws.

Next, she pulls on the goggles.Instead of a control panel, the home version has a control box, completewith joy-stick and a mini "ESCAPE" button.Alex fingers the "START" button on top of the joy-stick.THE SCREENgoes black, black with intermittent sparks.  And the BREATHING begins.ARCADE'S FACEappears in the black, a pin-point at first, spinning round and round andgrowing larger.  It comes to a rest, eyes glowing.

LEVEL ONE, THE PLAINS -- DAYAlex SLAMS into the ground, splashing up water and smoke alike.We are inside ARCADE now, experiencing what Alex experiences.THE PLAINS --In many respects it looks like Earth.  Land, water, sky... Yet certainthings are off.  Small things, like the color of light, a sluggishsmoke-filled RED, or the occasional FLICKER OF LIGHTNING which racesbeneath the cloud cover above.ALEXpulls herself up from the muck, brushing dirt and water from her face.She coughs, totally disoriented.  Looks around.Looks at herself.  She's wearing...BATTLE GEARThis is the real thing, as opposed to the cartoon version we saw Nickwearing when he played the game before.  It's a cross between askateboarder's protective guardpads and full-blown armor.  A helmet restson her head, with a visor raised up.Alex glances down and sees a thrasher board resting next to her.  (Note:Depending on the terrain of each level, the thrasher board will adjustitself...working as a skateboard, snowboard, or hover board).ON ALEX'S RIGHT CYBERGLOVEis an LED display.  In the upper left-hand corner it says "LEVEL ONE".

It fills up the world.ALEXjerks her head up, terrified.

Normal.She glances at the game.ON SCREENwe see the black again, black with sparks racing past. Benign.Alex reaches over and picks up the phone, all the while keeping her eyesglued to the screen.

It's		incredible!  I was just...				ALEX			(cutting him off)		Listen to me!  Greg never came home. I think		the game has something to do with it.				NICK (O.S.)			(filtered)		What the hell are you talking about?Alex continues to watch the television screen, almost mesmerized by theflickering sparks.  Her eyes begin to glaze over...				NICK (O.S.)

NICK (O.S.)			(filtered)		It's twelve-thirty!				ALEX		I'm coming over.Alex quickly hangs up the phone and moves back to the television.  Shereaches for the control box and hits the "OFF" switch.Nothing happens.  Sparks continue to shoot across the screen.Alex tries it again.  Same result.				ALEX		Shit...Again and again she hits the button, but nothing is happening.Alex reaches behind the t.v., grabs hold of the electrical cords, andYANKS.The fucking cord won't come out!And then she hears it, an ELECTRONIC WHISPER, both seductive and horrific.				ARCADE		ALEX...With all her might, Alex pulls on the cords. POP!  They fling out of thet.v. and the screen goes dead.Alex sits back against the wall for a moment, catching her breath andtrying to calm the rising hysteria within her.

He hasn't moved.  And yet, the t.v. is on onceagain.THE SCREENBlue static.  Unexceptional.  And a face?  Someone in the static?Alex draws closer to the screen.  She can hear SOMETHING now, other thanstatic whispers.  Sounds kind of like a VOICE...THE SCREENA definite, ghostly FACE is there.  It turns, looks at Alex (us) and it'sGreg.

Now she creeps towards a second-story window.Behind her on the street (and this should be subtle, folks), anotherSTREETLIGHT is flickering.WINDOWIt looks in on Nick's room.  Alex draws close and TAPS on the glass.Nick appears immediately, grinning like an idiot.  He raises the window.				NICK		Alex, you don't know how long I've waited		for this.				ALEX		Funny.Alex climbs in.INT.  NICK'S ROOM -- NIGHTThe room is an intricate shrine to Nick's obsession...computers andcomputer-generated images.  An entire wall is covered with a collage ofcut-out pictures from magazines.  On his shelves are miniaturearmatures...flexible models of human musculature.And of course, there is Nick's computer set-up.Even as Alex climbs down onto Nick's bed, she notices that his computer isup and running...connected to the ARCADE home version.				ALEX		What's that?Nick turns back to the computer monitor.FRACTALS(as seen earlier) are blossoming on the screen.				NICK		Isn't it amazing?  It's a sort of rest		position in the game, when you're between		levels.Nick pulls Alex closer.  She's wary.  But Nick is suitably impressed,excited even.				NICK			(continuing)		They're fractals.  Visual representations		of mathematic equations.  The game is		totally brilliant.  I mean, look at it,		it's like a DNA molecule or something...And in truth, the fractals are beautiful.Alex turns back to Nick.  And for the first time, Nick stops grinning.It's clear that Alex is upset.				ALEX		Something weird's happening.Nick sits down on his bed.				NICK		What do you mean by "weird"?				ALEX		Greg never came home.  A few hours is one		thing, Nick, but this is different.		Something's happened to him.Alex glances at the computer monitor again.  On the lower right-hand sideis a little pulsing GREEN light, on and off, on and off, like a heartbeat.				ALEX		Can you turn off the game?				NICK		I'm in the middle of it...				ALEX			(upset)		Turn if off!Nick is taken aback, but he rises and turns off the computer all the same.And this time, the game stays off.  Nick comes back to the bed.				NICK		Happy?				ALEX		No.			(frustrated)		Look, I know you're not going to believe me,		but listen anyway...			(carefully)		I think the game's alive somehow.The look on Nick's face says it all.  He moves to speak and she stops him.				ALEX			(continuing)		No, wait.  Just listen.  I hooked it up		earlier tonight, and it said my name.  As		soon as I turned it on, Nick.  It said my		name.  How could it know?  And then, I		asked it where Greg was, and it said, "In		here".				NICK		Alex, I think you're freaking out. Greg's		gone, I'll give you that.  And maybe he's		in trouble.  But it's not ARCADE that's		doing it...				ALEX			(insistent)		It is.				NICK		How?!  It's a machine, Alex. Machine's		don't think.  They're not alive.  It's a		good program, a brilliant program, it was		designed so it would act as if it were		alive, but it's not alive.				ALEX		So how did it know my name, then?				NICK			(shrugs)		You imagined it.Alex is furious.  She rises and begins pacing back and forth, voicegrowing louder.  She draws in close.				ALEX		See, men always do this.  "Quiet down,		honey.  Chill out.  Take a Valium". I'm not		a fucking idiot, Nick!			(screaming)		I DID NOT IMAGINE IT!!!				NICK			(a strained whisper)		Quiet.  I do have parents, you know.Alex spins around and points at the computer monitor.				ALEX		There!THE MONITORARCADE is back on again, fractals unfolding and green monitor lightblinking.ON NICKOkay.  Alright.  This does throw him for a second.				ALEX		It turned itself back on, Nick.				NICK		No it didn't.  It's just a faulty relay or		something.  It happens.Nick crosses to the monitor and flips the "OFF" switch.  He tries it againand again, but the game won't turn off.				ALEX		It's alive, Nick.  It's listening to us ...Nick spins around, angry, maybe a little freaked out.				NICK		Just shut up!  Enough already, okay?Silence for a moment.  Nick takes a deep breath.  Over-reacted.  After amoment...				NICK		Sorry.  Maybe I need the Valium.				ALEX		Call the others.  Laurie, Benz...Nick acquiesces.  He pulls out his phone and punches in a number.				NICK		I'll try Stilts.  He's got insomnia.Nick and Alex watch each other in silence as the connection is made.  Wecan faintly hear the phone RINGING.No answer.				NICK		Okay...Laurie, then.Alex turns away, sinking to Nick's bed.  All the anger has drained out ofher.  She knows they won't reach them.ON NICKAs he listens for an answer.  Three RINGS, four, five... He hangs up.Punches in the final number.				NICK		Benz...Again.  No answer.Nick hangs up and sets the phone aside.  He looks at Alex.				ALEX			(fatalistic)		Something's happened to them.				NICK		It's the middle of the night.  They're		asleep.  Phone didn't wake them.				ALEX		All of them?Nick shrugs.  He's not willing to accept anything, but he's uncomfortableall the same.				NICK		Look, why are you fucking with me like this?Alex rises.  She's tired.  Tired and scared.				ALEX		Because I didn't know where else to go.				NICK			(glances at a clock)		It's two o'clock in the morning.  Go home.		Go to sleep.  We'll figure something out in		the morning.And then, more for himself than for her.				NICK			(continuing)		It's not this weird.  It'll make sense.		Everything gets weird this late anyway,		right?				ALEX			(half-hearted)		Sure.She turns and climbs back out the window onto the roof. Then she ducks herhead back in.				ALEX		If I were you, I'd think twice about playing		that game again.Then she's gone.  Nick moves over and watches.NICK'S P.O.V.As Alex drops down from the roof and makes her way to Greg's car.

Nick looks equally tired, but Stilts isjawing away.As Alex joins them, Nick looks up.				ALEX		Well?  Where are the others?Nick shrugs, looking elsewhere.				STILTS		Sick?				ALEX		Everybody's sick, huh?			(glances at watch)		It's fifteen after.  We always meet here,		you know that.				STILTS			(to Nick)		What's her problem?				ALEX		Did you play ARCADE last night?				STILTS		Actually, no.  I was just telling Nick,		here, that my t.v.'s busted...Alex nods, glaring at Nick.  His reluctance to believe her isunderstandable, but the events unfolding are scaring him.				ALEX		You want to hear something else, Nick? I		tried to call them this morning...Greg,		Benz, Laurie...  Their phones are out of		order.Alex reaches into her bag and pulls out a sheet of paper with names on it.				ALEX			(continuing)		And then I started thinking...about everyone		else that was at Dante's yesterday.  I drew		up this list. DeLoach, those other jerks ...		their phones are out of order too.Stilts starts HUMMING The Twilight Zone theme.				NICK			(annoyed)		So what do you want me to do?Alex softens, then reaches for Nick's hand.				ALEX		We have to find out what's happened to them.		I think they're gone...				NICK		No way.				ALEX		If they're sick, great.  But let's make sure.			(pleading)		Come on, Nick.				NICK		Okay.  We'll see what's up.  But if things		are cool, I don't want to hear anything more		about this.  Life's too short, know what I		mean?Nick and Alex rise.				STILTS		So you guys are cutting school?  Lemme go		with you.				NICK		Just stay here, Stilts.				ALEX			(dead serious)		And don't watch any television.Stilts thinks Nick and Alex are involved in some sort of joke, but he'splaying along, grinning.				STILTS		Oh, okay.  Forget Twilight Zone, now we're		talking Outer Limits here.  We control your		horizontal, your vertical...				NICK		Just do what she says, Stilts.  And if we're		not back...				STILTS		I'll call the National Guard.  I got it		under control.			(giggles)		Oh, just one more thing.  Is it a		supernatural thing you guys are going off		to fight, or is it aliens, like Pod People		and stuff like that?  Cause there's a		difference, you know.  One you need garlic		and silver bullets for, the other...				NICK			(irritated)		Look at me, Stilts.  Am I laughing?The grins fades from Stilts' face.  Nick is definitely not laughing.

NICK			(freaked)		What is it?And as Nick speaks, his breath escapes his mouth in a frosty plume ofmist.  It's cold in here too.Laurie, meanwhile, has failed to notice Alex and Nick's arrival.

ARCADE			(mocking Greg, electronic)		"DON'T LEAVE ME HERE".And even as ARCADE speaks, the VOICE seems to come from all around them,from the HUMMING coursing through the walls.Nick backs away from the screen, petrified.

NICK		That's what I thought.				ALEX		What?				NICK		It's not just the cable system.  It's in		the phone system as well, the electronic		net.  It's everywhere.				ALEX		Nick, what is it.				NICK		Maybe it is alive in a way...some sort of		electronic intelligence.  It's like a		computer virus that developed a personality		or something.  It's self-replicating...it		mimics life.				ALEX		Like the fractals?Nick nods.  He grabs his skateboard out of the back seat and sits on thecurb, spinning a wheel with his finger.  He stares at the wheel a moment.				NICK		It's growing.  Getting stronger. Maybe it's		only localized now...				ALEX			(catching his drift)		...but then it hits the relay stations...				NICK		Right.  And then communication satellites,		and then anywhere.Alex looks up into the sky despite herself.				ALEX			(disbelief)		Anywhere.			(beat)		We have to stop it from getting out.

NICK		I don't know.Alex stalks off a few paces.  Thinking.  Thinking...				ALEX		SLIP-STREAM.				NICK		What?				ALEX		They made ARCADE.  It's still a game,		right?  It thinks like a game.  Maybe it		still has to play by the rules. Someone had		to program it in the first place, didn't		they?.At this, Nick perks up.				NICK		You mean we learn the rules...				ALEX		And beat it at it's own game.				NICK		You realize that in order to do that, we'd		actually have to play the game.				ALEX		I was afraid you'd say that.								CUT TO:EXT.

MAN			(to screen)		Come on, come on...He moves his head this way and that...THE MONITORSA computer-animated TURTLE is crawling across the screen. Then the words"TIME'S UP" flash over.  The turtle flips onto it's back and dies, tonguehanging out.				MAN		Shit.				DIFFORD			(clearing his throat)		Albert...ALBERT turns around in his seat and pulls off the helmet.				DIFFORD			(continuing)		This is Nick and Alex.  They'd like to talk		to you about ARCADE.  Maybe you can give		them a few programmer's secrets.				ALBERT		Yeah, sure.				DIFFORD			(to Nick and Alex)		Then I leave you in capable hands.Difford exits.  Nick points to the helmet in Albert's hands.				NICK		Does that thing work?				ALBERT		Getting there.  It's more sensitive than a		joy-stick.  Your video-character can respond		as fast as you can.			(standing)		But what can I do for you?				ALEX		We're having some problems with ARCADE...				ALBERT		Yeah, who isn't.				NICK		What do you mean?				ALBERT		It's a tough game.  Hard to pin that bastard		down.  Keeps on changing the rules.				ALEX		We vere thinking there might be tricks.		You know, surprises that you'd worked into		the game...				ALBERT		Sure.  Every game's got 'em.  I'll start		with the schematics.  I can print these up		if you want.Albert moves back to the wall of monitors, then reaches for a computerdisk and inserts it into a nearby drive.  He taps a few buttons andBINGO...SCHEMATICSof each world/level within the ARCADE game appear on the monitors.				ALBERT		You've got your ten levels, right? Here		they are...  Each level has an exit, only		remember, the exits aren't always what they		seem.			(points to each one)		First one's The Blood Red Sky, then you've		got The Blue Desert, Tower of Ghosts,		Kingdom of the Blind...  On each world you		have to find a golden key and you've only		got so much time to do it in.  If you're		too late, The Screamer comes.				NICK		How do you stop The Screamer?				ALBERT		You can't.  He gets you and you're dead.		It's like time catching up with you, you		know?  Like Fate.  Each level you get		progressively less time to complete.  First		half of the game takes place in the Wild		Lands.  Then you reach Level 6, and that's		the Sea of Darkness.  There's a two-headed		Boatman that'll take you across if you		answer his riddle right.  If you don't...He motions cutting a knife across his throat.				NICK		What's the riddle?				ALBERT		If I tell you, then it's no fun.				NICK			(harder)		Just tell me the fucking riddle.				ALBERT		Well...it involves a paradox.  You have to		trick The Boatman.			(beat)		Now all the while, you also have to watch		your strength.  You can build that back up		by catching FIREFLIES...the little glowing		guys...Albert hits some keys again and Levels One through Six disappear.  Nowthey're replaced by Seven through Ten. Only instead of a schematic forLevel Eleven, there's only a question matc.				ALBERT			(continuing)		The next half of the game takes place in		ARCADE's brain, The City of Truth. It's		urban scenarios, lots of metal and concrete.		Screamer comes faster here.  On Level Four		you can get a free life if you wait until		the last possible second before exiting that		world.  Gotta time it right though.				ALEX		What's the question mark?				ALBERT		Level Ten.  That's where you've got to		unlock ARCADE's heart using the keys you've		found.				ALEX		How do you do that?				ALBERT		Good question.  See, that's where the fun		comes in.  ARCADE changes it every time.		He's a machine without a soul. Once you give		him a soul, he stops being a threat.Alex looks dejected.				ALEX		But how can it change every time?				ALBERT		It's the game's logic core.  We actually		patterned it after human brainwaves.  I		mean, there's a personality in there.		That's what makes it so incredible.				NICK		How the hell did you do that?				ALBERT		Well, we're veering into classified info		here, but I'll tell you that it involved a		donor.  He was dead of course, so it's not		like anything unethical was happening.At this, a chill runs down Alex's spine.				ALEX		Dead?				ALBERT		Well, brain-dead anyway.  Coma patient.		It's really not all that important.				ALEX		Maybe he's not dead.				ALBERT		He?				ALEX		The donor.  Maybe he's alive inside the		game.				ALBERT			(laughs)		And maybe you've been taking too many drugs.Nick glances at the helmet again.				NICK		Could you play ARCADE with that?				ALBERT		Well, technically "yes", but this is only		the prototype.Nick nods and smiles, offering his hand.				NICK		Thanks, Albert.  Think you could print up		those schematics?				ALBERT		Sure.Albert moves back to the computer console.  Meanwhile, Nick pulls Alexaside.				NICK			(quietly)		Go outside, get your car, and meet me out		front with the engine running. And make it		quick, okay?				ALEX		What are you going to do?				NICK		Get that helmet.  If we're going to play		ARCADE, I want every advantage possible.ACROSS THE LAB,Albert is oblivious to their conversation.Alex backs towards the lab doors, turns, and opens them.								CUT TO:INT. SLIP-STREAM HALLWAY - DAYAlex makes her way quickly down the hall, turning a corner and passing aSECURITY GUARD.  She waves at him, her smile fading as soon as she'spassed.								CUT TO:INT. R&D LAB - DAYAlbert is just pulling the last printed copy of the schematics from alaser printer.  He turns and hands them to Nick.				ALBERT		Here you go.  Happy hunting.Nick takes the schematics and tucks them inside his jacket.				NICK		Thanks again.And with that, Nick pulls back his fist and punches Albert square in theface.Albert goes down, more stunned than hurt, and Nick springs into action.He scoops up the CyberHelmet in his free hand, kicks open the doors, andtosses his skateboard into the hallway...INT. SLIP-STREAM HALLWAY - DAYNick leaps on the board and starts pumping his foot like a bandit, pickingup speed like mad...He's racing down the hallway, maneuvering between startled EMPLOYEES.

ANOTHER HALLWAY - DAYNick comes SCREECHING around the corner, narrowly missing a collision withtwo SECURITY GUARDS.				GUARD #1		That's him!But Nick's already past them.  He puts his foot down again, pushing formore momentum...THE GUARDSare after him now, CHARGING down the hallway.UP AHEAD,A set of double doors labeled "EMERGENCY EXIT" blocks his way.Nick spins out, sweeping the back of the board forward and SCREAMS to astop just before the doors.  He kicks the board up into his free handand...WHAM!  He hits the doors running.  Now the FIRE ALARM is blaring inaddition to the other alarm.  A VOICE is squawking over the P.A. and it'sa hell of a racket.				VOICE			(on P.A.)		SECURITY BREACH IN R&D.  SUBJECT HEADING		TOWARDS EASTERN EXIT...INT.

Nick tumbles out of the stairwell only to see a trio of GUARDSheading straight for him.Nick drops his board to the ground and heads right, pumping his foot...One of the GUARDS leaps at him and......misses by a foot or so, CRASHING to the tile floor.NICKSCREECHES to another stop, TWISTS, and starts pumping down anotherhallway...INT. LOADING AREA -- DAYNick plows into the loading area like a bullet, whipping around stacks ofboxes and lumbering forklifts.  A few WORKERS attempt to stop him, buthe's moving too fast.AHEAD,is a loading dock, raised four feet from the ground to accommodate semis.Nick's heading for it.  The loading door is open, and outside is freedom.JUST THEN,the steel loading door begins to GRIND and lower.  Some genius has hit thecontrols.NICKpumps like mad, and he's really moving now.  Either he'll make it, or he'sgoing to hit that steel door at about forty miles and hour...THE DOORis quickly closing off Nick's escape route.  He's only got about four feetto negotiate...Nick ducks low and clears it!EXT. LOADING DOCK -- DAYNick ROCKETS off the loading dock, through the air and down, hitting theconcrete driveway.  The driveway peels off to the left and slopesdownward.Nick hangs tight, hugs the curve, and picks up more speed.BELOW,the driveway splits off.  To the left, SLIP-STREAM's main building, and tothe right, the parking lot.GUARDSare piled into an electric cart, SPEEDING up from the left to cut Nickoff.  It's going to be close...Nick forks off to the right dust before they reach him.It's clear sailing now, and up ahead, Nick can see Alex pulling up to theend of the driveway...WHOOSH!  Nick scrapes the board forward, grinding the wheels sideways inorder to slow his speed...He leaps. picking the board up with him. and dunks himself smack-dab inthe back seat of the Skylark.ALEXguns the engine and tears away in a cloud of exhaust.EXT. COUNTRY ROAD -- DAYNick is in the back seat, LAUGHING.  The sun is beginning its descent andthe sky is taking on a reddish tint.				NICK		Jesus Christ!				ALEX		I can't believe you made it!Nick climbs into the front seat next to Alex, and for a second, he'spretty close to her.  He kisses her on the cheek...caught up in themoment.  Then he sinks back, catching his breath.				ALEX		You got the schematics?				NICK		Everything.Neither one speaks for a moment as the mood dampens once again.  Driving.Wind whipping Alex's hair around.  She stares at the road ahead.				ALEX		So where do we play the game, Nick?Nick doesn't answer at first.  For a second there, he'd managed to forgeteverything.				NICK		I've been thinking about that.			(beat)		ARCADE's like a virus, so it seems like the		place to hit him would be where the virus		started.  You know, like his point of origin?				ALEX			(grim)		Dante's Inferno.				NICK		Yeah.

DANTE'S INFERNO ROOF - NIGHTAlex and Nick creep over the roof, and sure enough, there's a skylight inthe center, caked with grime.Nick stands and plants his foot through the skylight.  It SHATTERS,raining down glass into the darkness below.Nick pulls off his belt and hooks it around one of the iron sash bars.Gripping the belt, he lowers himself down. After a moment, he disappearsfrom view.Alex leans over the skylight.  She can't see a thing.				ALEX		Nick...			(beat)		Nick!For the longest moment there's no response.  Then...				NICK (O.S.)			(from below)		Okay, your turn.Alex climbs over and grasps the belt tightly, lowering herself down intoThe Inferno.INT.  DANTE'S INFERNO -- NIGHTAlex dangles from the skylight, a good eight feet from the floor.				ALEX			(warily)		Are you there?HER P.O.V.The Inferno is a world of threatening shapes and shadows. And Nick isnowhere to be seen.Alex steels herself and drops to the floor.She stands, a bit shaky, and cautiously moves around a cluster of videogames.NICKis standing on the other side, staring at a game screen which pulses witha DIM LIGHT.Alex approaches, putting a hand on his shoulder.  He turns.				NICK		Alex...				ALEX		You didn't hear me?Nick shakes his head.  Alex leans forward to see what he's looking at.ON THE SCREENfractals are unfolding.  It's mesmerizing.				ALEX		Stop looking at it.Nick shuts his eyes, pulling away from the screen.  He shakes his head,trying to clear his thoughts.				NICK		Shit...it's like a trance or something...			(breathes)		Okay.  I'm fine.  Really.It's at that moment that Nick and Alex hear the VOICES.VIDEO SCREENSall around them flicker on, static-laced IMAGES fading in. They are thefaces of their friends...Greg, Laurie, and many others.  All those thathave disappeared.  The VOICES fade in and out, merging with one another,tinged with the same mechanical edge of ARCADE's voice.				VOICES			(eerie)		Nick...Alex...save us...				ALEX			(horrified)		Oh God...Nick grabs Alex and pulls her into the canter of the room.				NICK		Put it out of your head, Alex.  It's just		trying to psyche us out.Despite Nick's words, we can tell that the VOICES are having adisheartening effect on him.THE ARCADEprototype stands in front of them now, and surprisingly, the machine isnot on.  The eyes in the leering black face are quite dead.Around Alex and Nick, the faces of their friends continue to fade in andout, casting the whole room in a strange shimmering blue light.Nick moves to the back of the machine and opens the access panel,revealing the internal circuitry.  He pulls a small penlight from hispocket and flips it on.				ALEX		What are you looking for?				NICK		A way to hook this helmet into the game.		I'm sure there are interfaces...NICK'S P.O.V.And indeed there are.  Parallel interfaces, where you might hook a printercable into a computer.  Nick takes the cable from the CyberHelmet andsecures it into one of the interfaces.				NICK		There.  Now we're wired in.He stands and moves around front, pressing the "START" button of the game.Nothing happens.He presses it again.  Nothing.				ALEX		Is the game plugged in?Nick checks.  It is.				NICK			(frustrated)		I don't understand.  It wants us to play		the game.  It's been taunting us ...				ALEX		Put in a quarter.				NICK		It can turn itself on, Alex!  It doesn't		need a quarter.				ALEX		Yes it does.  Don't you see?  We have to		play by the rules.  That's what it wants.Nick rifles through his pockets.  He doesn't have a quarter.  Neither doesAlex.				NICK		Change machine.Nick moves over to the change machine and picks up a nearby chair.  HeSMASHES the chair into the face of the machine again and again,obliterating the lock.  Nick opens the front of the machine and tears outthe coin box, spilling quarters all over the floor.  He grabs a handfuland returns.				NICK		There.He shoves one in ARCADE's coin-slot and pulls on the CyberGloves.				ALEX		Two players, Nick.  You need to put in		another quarter.Nick straps the goggles over his eyes.				NICK		You're not coming, Alex.				ALEX		Yes I am...				NICK			(snapping)		I know how to do this!  I'm good at these		games.  You never play, you'd be nailed in		an instant.				ALEX		And what if something happens to you? Am I		suppose to go in after you alone?!				NICK		No.  If you're smart, you run like hell.Alex grabs a second quarter and shoves it in the coin slot.				ALEX		I'm going.Nick stares at her a moment, then nods tiredly.  She reaches for thesecond pair of CyberGloves and pulls them on.				NICK		You don't get it, do you?				ALEX			(strapping on goggles)		What?				NICK		I don't want anything to happen to you.  I		care about you.				ALEX		I already have a boyfriend, Nick.				NICK		I know.			(beat)		It sucks.The two of them stand there a moment, looking at one another.  After amoment, Nick laughs tiredly.				NICK		What can I say?			(pulls on the CyberHelmet)		Tough being a hero, isn't it?Nick reaches out for the joy-stick and hits the "START" button.				NICK			(grim)		Here goes nothing.As before, the screen comes to life.  Darkness and sparks. Then we hearthe BREATHING.ARCADE'S FACEspins into view, grinning at Alex and Nick.				ARCADE		NICK.  ALEX.  I MISSED YOU SO MUCH. ALL		YOUR FRIENDS ARE HERE.				ALEX		Fuck-you.				ARCADE		ANY TIME.				ALEX		We know what you are.				ARCADE		A HEARTLESS MONSTER, OF COURSE.			(incredibly evil)		OH SAVE ME, ALEX, SAVE ME FROM MYSELF.ARCADE laughs and it's not a sound you'd want to hear twice.THE LIGHTBEAMclicks on, playing over their faces and analyzing their features.ON SCREENARCADE'S face spins away and computer-generated versions of Alex and Nickappear.  As before, they are suited up in video game armor, each carryinga thrasher board.				ARCADE		KISS REALITY GOODBYE.The video versions of Nick and Alex hop onto their thrasher boards and theworld around them curls in upon itself.The process is similar to what we've seen before, but even more extreme.LIGHTS and SOUNDS are pouring out of the ARCADE machine in almostunbearable intensities.  It seems as if the "real" world is going to beshaken apart.				NICK			(over noise)		Hold on!				ARCADE		SEE YOU ON THE OTHER SIDE.ANOTHER FLASH OF LIGHT AND...Alex and Nick disappear from the real world completely. Their equipment,gloves and goggles, fall to the floor, empty.  They've been physicallysucked inside the game!The light from the screen dies down now and everything is oddly quiet.ON SCREENBOOM!  Suddenly a circuit grid is rushing up to meet them!(Note:  As we move through each level, video legends will appear on thescreen as title cards, enhancing the effect that we are actually inside avideo game.)The words "LEVEL ONE -- BLOOD RED SKY" flash across the screen and we...								CUT TO:EXT.  LEVEL ONE, THE PLAINS -- DAYAlex and Nick slam into the ground like twin meteors, splashing up waterand muck.THE RED SKYcrackles with LIGHTNING.  Smoke obscures everything. Alex and Nick pullthemselves up, a bit dazed.				ALEX			(looking around)		You feel it?  It's different this time.				NICK		We're actually inside, aren't we?Alex nods.				NICK		Okay.			(deep breath)		Give us a kiss?				ALEX			(after a moment)		One.  In case...				NICK		Don't even say it.Nick leans over and gently kisses Alex on the lips.  It's over in amoment, but he'll savor it the rest of his life.				NICK		Thanks.  Always wanted to do that.				ALEX		Yeah, well I figure these are unusual		circumstances.				NICK			(grins)		That's what I was hoping you'd say.Nick flips the visor on his helmet down and checks the digital read-out onhis CyberGlove.  When he speaks, his VOICE is filtered through a radioheadset.  Nick looks good in his armor, tough.  Hell, they both do.				NICK		I'll take the lead and handle the physical		threats.  You watch the elapsed time and		look for exits.				ALEX		Got it.Nick tosses his thrasher board down and it hovers above the water.  Hesteps onto it, comfortable.  Alex does the same. She's a little shaky, butshe maintains her balance.				NICK		You steer by pivoting your back foot...			(he demonstrates)		Okay?Nick turns, looking around.  The land seems identical in every direction.				NICK		Which way do you think Level Two is?				ALEX		You've got the schematics, check.Nick panics for a moment, patting his uniform, checking pockets.  He can'tfind them.				NICK		Oh shit!  What if they didn't come with us?!He stops.  Reaches into a pocket, and pulls out the schematics.  Breathesa sigh of relief.				NICK			(looking at them)		Okay.  It's West.				ALEX		The keys are supposed to be at the end of		each level.  Once we get all the keys, we		can unlock ARCADE's heart. And then...She looks at Nick, uncertain.				NICK		...and then we go to the Final Level.			(off her look)		Hey, don't worry about it.  It's a game.		How bad could it be?Alex glances at her wrist display.  The "ELAPSED TIME" bar is made up often blocks of light stacked upon each other. The top block hasdisappeared.  One tenth of their time is gone.				ALEX		The clock's already ticking.				NICK		Right, then...Nick leans forward and the board starts to float.  Alex does the same, andin seconds, they're gliding over the plains.FROM ABOVE,as we see their forms disappear in the smoke.							DISSOLVE TO:EXT. LEVEL ONE, PLAINS -- LATERNick and Alex pull to a stop.A DOORWAYstands in the plains, seemingly leading to nowhere.  Nick reaches out andopens it.  It's just plains and empty space beyond......but hanging from the top of the doorway is a golden key.				ALEX		There...She reaches up and pulls it down.				NICK		I don't get it.  This is supposed to be the		end of the level, but it doesn't go anywhere.Alex puts her hand through the doorway and her hand disappears.				ALEX		It only looks like it leads to nowhere.Nick glances at his wrist display.				NICK		And we've still got time left.  This was a		piece of cake.				ALEX		Yeah, that's what worries me.She steps through the doorway and disappears.  Nick follows.We hold on the empty doorway.  Hold for a moment, and then...We hear a distant, high-pitched RINGING.  It's grating, seeping inside ourbrains and mucking around in there.  On the horizon there is a quick FLASHOF LIGHT.Something is coming.								CUT TO:The words "LEVEL TWO -- DEADLANDS"EXT.  LEVEL TWO, SALT FLATS -- DAYAlex and Nick are cruising along salt flats.  Sporadic pools of water andstrange ROARING sounds in the mist.  So far so good. Nick glances at hiswrist display.  His "STRENGTH" only has a few blocks left.				NICK		Hey, my strength's low.  Look out for		Fireflies.				ALEX		There...She points North.  A small BALL OF LIGHT is streaking across the sky, justabove the watery plains.Alex and Nick swerve towards it, gaining ground.  As they near it, Nickswings out his hand, scooping the Firefly up. As soon as he touches it, itbursts like a bubble.				NICK		Shit...				ALEX		Check your read-out.Nick does.  His "STRENGTH" is back to normal again.				NICK		You're right.  It worked.Nick and Alex slow their boards to a stop, stepping off them.				ALEX			(pointing)		There's another...She sweeps left and scoops the second Firefly out of the sky.  Off in thedistance we can hear that RINGING again, just at the edge of our vision.Alex and Nick don't hear it yet.Nick is glancing down at his schematic of Level Two.				NICK		According to this, the doorway should be		somewhere around here...THEIR P.O.V.The salt flats have gradually diminished, replaced by more and more water.Ahead of them, there's no longer anything solid to stand on...just water,muck, and strange reeds poking through the mist.Alex's wrist display begins to BEEP.  She glances down.WRIST DISPLAYOnly one block of time remains and it's pulsing on and off. The RINGING isa little louder now.				ALEX			(worried)		Our time's up.				NICK		What?!  There's nothing here!				ALEX		Look around...The two of them stumble through the water, not even sure of what they'relooking for.				NICK			(starting to panic)		I don't see the doorway!Alex and Nick's wrist displays are BEEPING like crazy now. The beeps comecloser and closer until they meld into one piercing high-pitched TONE.JUST THEN,the RINGING turns into the SHRIEK/SONIC BOOM of the Screamer.  A burst oflight on the horizon shatters the sky.				NICK		What the fuck is that?!				ALEX		Screamer.ALEXplunges into the marsh-like water, waist-high, and it's then that she seesa glow emanating from beneath the water.

He can see the GLOW now too.				NICK			(incredulous)		We can't reach that!				ALEX			(over the noise)		We don't have a choice!Alex dives beneath the surface again.Nick glances back towards the horizon and gets one fleeting glimpse of...THE SCREAMERA nightmare creation rocketing in from the East... That's it for Nick.  Hedives, terrified.UNDERWATER,Nick follows Alex into the shadowy depths.  He swims madly, but the GLOWseems impossibly far away.  Even under water, the Apocalyptic sound of theScreamer can be heard.NICKpeddles his arms and legs furiously.  Down, down, down...He knows that they'll never have enough air to make it back to thesurface.THE GLOWis more clearly distinguished now.  It's a DOORWAY.  And set in its sideis a golden key.  Alex reaches it.  She grabs the key and turns to see howfar behind Nick is...NICKdoubles his efforts, but his lungs are straining...THE SCREAMERhas plunged into the water above, shooting towards Nick like a torpedo, aswirling jet-stream of bubbles trailing around it.Nick panics, and what little air he has left escapes him.Alex is reaching for Nick...Nick is blacking out, one last lunge at the doorway...The Screamer is there now.

There's an eerie stillness about this Level,even the clouds above are frozen. Nothing lives here now, and nothing everwill.Nick coughs, sucking in air.Alex rises halfway, pulling up her visor.  She stares at the golden keywhich she clutches in her hand.  Her wet hair hangs about her face instrings and she shivers.				NICK			(looking at the key)		So that's what we almost died for?				ALEX		One of them, anyway...			(beat)		Did you see it?  The Screamer?

That's it.Alex pulls on Nick's arm, forcing him to his feet.				ALEX		Get up, Nick...Nick isn't going anywhere fast.  Alex tries to drag him forward, but sheslips in the sand.				ALEX		GET UP!!!And then, from off in the distance...				VOICE (O.S.)			(far away)		Alex...help me...Alex turns.  She focuses on the horizon and sees a tiny speck.

ARCADE		GOODBYE, NICK.At the last possible moment, Nick seems to wake from his trance.  He seesAlex, hears her, then turns.  He has about one fear-wrought second torealize that the Screamer has reached him when...WHAM!!!!!!!!!The Screamer SLAMS into Nick at about 200 miles per hour. Nick, literally,liquefies.  The human body is 95% water, and Nick EXPLODES like a waterballoon on high impact, blood spraying in a fine mist across the dunes,Alex, and everything for a good fifty yards.Alex is frozen with terror.  You remember your worst childhood nightmaremonster?  The one you'd see in your room at night as your brain cookedwith fever?  Too paralyzed to call out for Mom?  Well that's the Screamer.THE SCREAMERstands where Nick used to be (a red mess on the blue sand now).  Black asnight.  Like living, roiling lava. Smoking, charged RED EYES.  One thirddemon, one third Balrog, and one third rotting corpse.  Clad in chains andsamurai armor, CLINKING as it moves.  It rear back its head, opens afanged mouth, and lets loose a ROAR designed to shake the stars from thesky.Then it focuses it's eyes on Alex.  And it charges.ALEXunfreezes.  She's got seconds to make up her mind, the doorway/mouth orthe Screamer.  It's really no choice at all.  Alex turns and divesstraight down into the pulsing mouth.The jaws of the rabbit hole SNAP shut around her.  Darkness consumeseverything.These words appear on screen, "LEVEL THREE -- TOWER OF GHOSTS"								CUT TO:EXT.  LEVEL FOUR, VOLCANO -- DAYWe are looking at a steep cliff face composed of black, volcanic rock.This world is desaturated, gray, and harsh. The rocks looks sharp asrazors.As we will discover, the cliff face is also composed of skulls, old andblackened, set inside the rock.We hear a HUMMING and Alex "fades in", appearing on the side of the cliffface.  Immediately she starts to fall, realizes where she is, and hugs thecliff for dear life. Rock shards crumble away beneath her feet.  Alexlooks down ...Big mistake.She hugs the cliff face tighter, tears and grime streaking her face. She'salone now and she knows it.  She looks up ...It's a long way to go.Alex reaches a hand upward.  Ouch!  The rock's hot.  She jerks her handback and almost loses her perch.HER HANDHer gloves are smoking and singed.Alex starts to cry freely now.  She reaches inside her chestplate,fumbling, and pulls something out...It's the Polaroid of her and Greg.  But then the wind catches it and tearsit from her hand.THE POLAROIDtwists downward, round and round into infinity.Alex stares after it a moment.  Then she lets out a tired little laugh andstarts to climb.A SERIES OF DISSOLVES...as Alex climbs, sometimes using a skull itself as a hand or foothold.We see her "TIME ELAPSED" blocks blinking away.Time running out and more climbing.  Then...EXT.  LEVEL FOUR, VOLCANO RIM -- DAYAlex stands on the rim of the volcano.  At her feet is a golden key.  Andbefore her, a big drop.ALEX'S WRIST DISPLAYHer final block of time disappears.  The BEEPING starts.Alex doesn't even pause.  She steps off the rim into empty space......and just as she's about to fall, a doorway of light appears in the air.Alex falls through it, vanishing."LEVEL FIVE -- KINGDOM OF THE BLIND"								CUT TO:EXT.

ALBERT'S VOICE (V.O.)		You can get a free life on Level Four, but		you have to wait for the last possible		instant...Alex turns and waits calmly for the Screamer.THE SCREAMERis a black speck on the horizon, then a bullet, then a nightmarish facebearing down on her...IT'S JAWSflare open to engulf her.Alex doesn't flinch at all.  And at the last possible second beforeimpact...BLINK!  A stylized figure appears on her wrist-display next to the "TIMEELAPSED" meter.  Beneath the figure it says "FREE LIFE".Alex feels the breath of the Screamer on her face and falls back throughthe doorway..."LEVEL SIX -- SHOCK CORRIDOR"								CUT TO:INT.  LEVEL SIX, SHOCK CORRIDOR -- NIGHTAlex steps out of a doorway into a long, narrow hallway. The hallway ismirrored on one side.  It has no doors or windows, and up ahead, itbranches off to the right and the left.Alex turns and looks behind her.  The doorway she came through is gonenow.  A mirrored wall stands in its place, with her own reflection staringback at her.THE REFLECTIONThere are subtle changes.  They shouldn't be noticeable at first, but thereflection seems somehow more threatening.Alex starts down the hall, her reflection keeping pace with her.  Upahead, she hears a BUZZING noise, drawing closer.LIGHT flickers in the hallway to the left, presumably whatever it isthat's BUZZING.  Suddenly a streak of light, running along the floor,turns the corner and heads down the hallway towards Alex.The light hits her feet and SPARKS fly.  Alex SCREAMS and is thrown backagainst the wall, shocked.  The streak of light continues past her anddisappears into the mirror at the hall's end.  It's like a movingelectrical pulse.ALEXShe's been given a pretty good jolt.  Her hands shake for a moment, anafter-seizure of sorts, and she stands...HER MIRRORED REFLECTIONis watching her, arms crossed.  This wouldn't be a problem were it not forthe fact that Alex currently doesn't have her arms crossed!				ALEX			(to her reflection)		Fuck you.The reflection grins and its/her eyes GLOW with fractals.				ALEX REFLECTION			(in ARCADE'S voice)		ANY TIME, BITCH.Spooked, Alex continues down the hallway, reaching the end and turningleft...NEW CORRIDORAlex moves quicker now, glancing left as her reflection follows.BUZZZZZ!!!  Here comes another streak of light, rushing in along the floorfrom a side corridor...Alex LEAPS over it, and it passes harmlessly under her. Now she's gettingthe hang of it.  She starts forward again.BUZZZZZ!!!  Here come two at a time from opposite directions...Alex has to jump left to avoid the first streak and lands directly in thepath of the second.  Then she jumps back to the right again...THE TWO STREAKSpass by, zipping away from each other.ANOTHER CORRIDORThe pace quickens, with Alex racing down the corridors. She turns cornerafter corner.  It's become a virtual maze.We cut back to Alex's "STRENGTH" and "TIME ELAPSED" meters again andagain.  Both are shrinking away to nothing.And all the while, her reflection keeps pace with her, growingincreasingly more nightmarish in appearance.  As Alex tires, thereflection seems to gain more strength.BUZZZZZ!!!  BUZZZZZ!!!  The streaks are shooting towards her with morefrequency, and now they're racing along the walls too.  Alex is jumpingleft and right, with SPARKS exploding around her.THE REFLECTIONseems to be metamorphosizing.  Each time we see it/her, she looks a littledifferent.  What's gradually happening (as time elapses) is that Alex'sreflection is turning into The Screamer.Alex moves with increasing urgency as the streaks converge on her.  Thecorridors are filled with a constant BUZZING and flickering of light.SPARKS fly and Alex is shocked over and over.She stumbles, falls to the floor, and rolls to the right, just missing astreak.  It cuts past her face, centimeters away.BEEP!  BEEP!  BEEP!  Off goes her wrist display!  Alex is up and runningnow, desperate.We cut faster and faster  Alex running, the streaks of light, thereflection until...END CORRIDORShe's back where she started.  And the corridor dead-ends in a mirroredwall...BEHIND ALEX,Dozens of light streaks are dogging her heels, literally just behind her.They're so thick that she couldn't possibly leap over all of them.Seconds before they reach her.AHEAD OF ALEX,the mirror shows her own reflection, rushing closer.  Her wrist displayindicates that time is up with a prolonged BEEP and her own reflectionvanishes.  It's the Screamer in her reflection's place.  Only it'srocketing towards her in the mirror.  It's in front of her this time,instead of behind her.Rock and a fucking hard place.  Light streaks or Screamers?It's really no choice at all.  Her guts says "Screamer".Alex leaps and SMASHES into the mirror at full speed.  The world is filledwith SHATTERING GLASS and a shower of infinite reflections and then we...								CUT TO:EXT.  LEVEL SEVEN, PIER -- DAYThe sound of SHATTERING GLASS carried through as Alex EXPLODES out of thesky.  And it's the sky itself that seems to be shattering...Title reads "LEVEL SEVEN -- SEA OF DARKNESS"ALEXcontinues her fall.  She lands hard.  No blue desert sand to cushion herhere.  It takes her a moment to rise...Alex is on a slat-board pier extending out into a sea of black water.  Theshore is completely desolate with the exception of the pier.  Stormsclouds have gathered above, and if you've seen a storm blowing in on theopen sea, you know what it looks like......the and of the world.  A strange and scary yellow/green sky pressesdown on us.  It's a hurricane sky.  The calm before the storm.ON THE HORIZON,TWO CITIES can be seen.  Techno-cityscapes, angular and metallic-looking,towers jutting up from the sea like knives.AT THE END OF THE PIERSare two boats.  Standing in them are two pale-faced, cloaked FIGURES.Like Charon, the boatman on the river Styx.Somewhere off in the distance, the RINGING can be distinctly heard now.But Alex is preoccupied now.  As she moves down the pier, recognitiondawns on her.It's Laurie and Stilts.  They are dressed completely in black, hairslicked back and eyes empty.  White-faced Gothic harlequins.  Each isholding a wooden staff, staring into space.				ALEX		Guys!  Oh my God...Alex rushes forward, excited, but as she sees their faces excitementfades.  A chill wind picks up and the sea laps at the pier like ametronome, lulling the world into stillness.				ALEX			(unsure)		Laurie?  Stilts?Neither of them acknowledges Alex with their eyes.				STILTS			(like ARCADE)		You may ask one of us a question.		One tells the truth, and the other lies.		Who you ask, remains your discretion.		But if the answer is wrong,		the questioner dies.Laurie motions to the techno-cities behind her.				LAURIE			(like ARCADE)		One of these cities, is the place you seek.		The Teller of Truths will take you there.		But the City of Lies, is dark and bleak.		And death is certain if you enter, beware.				STILTS		I am The Liar.  Where should I take you?				LAURIE		I am the Truth Teller.  Where should I take		you?Alex stares at them a moment, utterly confused.  The sky above darkens,and the wind picks up.  She looks to the horizon, from one city toanother, then back at her friends.				ALEX			(horrified)		What did he do to you?				LAURIE		Is that your question?				ALEX			(realizing)		Wait!  No!  That's not it!BEEP! BEEP! BEEP!  Alex doesn't even need to look at her wrist displayanymore.  She begins to pace on the end of the pier, nervously glancing atthe horizon.  And yes, there's the FLASH followed by the SHRIEK/SONICBOOM.				ALEX			(to herself)		Think!  I want to go to the City of Truth,		and the Truth Teller is from there...but		which one is which?  The liar...think!				LAURIE		You have no time.  What is your question?				ALEX			(snapping back)		I'm thinking!				LAURIE		You have no time.THE SCREAMERis visible now, arms opening to engulf Alex.  Talk about pressure.				ALEX			(she stops pacing)		The liar...Truth Teller...liar...liar...Alex rushes over to Stilts.				ALEX		Liar.  Did you come from the city on the		left, or the city on the right?				STILTS			(pointing)		I came from the city on the left.				ALEX			(grins)		But you always lie, so you didn't come from		there.  That means the city on the left must		be the City of Truth.THE SCREAMERhas reached the pier now, rocketing over the wooden slats and shaking theentire structure...Alex turns to Laurie.				ALEX			(quickly)		Take me to the city on the left!Laurie nods and steps aside, making room for Alex to climb into the boat.She does and...THE SCREAMERdissipates just before it reaches Alex.  It turns into mist and vanishes,the HOWL lingering as an echo long after the Screamer itself has gone.At once, the boat begins to glide through the water, away from the pier.Alex gets a last glimpse of Stilts standing in his boat, diminishing asAlex and Laurie move away from him.  He looks like the loneliest person inthe world."LEVEL EIGHT -- CITY OF TRUTH"EXT. LEVEL SEVEN, OPEN SEA -- LATERAs Alex and Laurie near the city, its features become more apparent.  Itis truly a Necropolis, black and angular. It's a shadow on the sunsethorizon, empty of all life and looming above them.Just then, Alex hears a tiny VOICE.				VOICE			(weak)		Help...help me...A SMALL FIGUREbobs in the water about fifty yards in front of them.  It waves it's handsfrantically, sinking below the water's surface, then rising once again.It's a little BOY.Alex's boat is going to pass right by the boy.  She grabs hold of thegunwale and reaches out for him...				ALEX		Grab my hand!Their hands lock and Alex YANKS the boy out of the water as the boatcruises by.THE BOYcan't be more than seven or eight.  Small and frail-looking, he shivers inher arms.				BOY			(terrified)		Where are we?Just then the boat comes to a CRASHING stop, slamming into the black rockswhich the city rests on.  Alex and the boy are violently pitched forwardand out of the boat.They land roughly on a beach of black gravel.  Alex turns.LAURIEstands in the boat.  In an instant, night has fallen.  She is a silhouettein the moonlight.				LAURIE			(in a voice like Death)		The City of Truth.And Laurie literally fades before their eyes.  In her place, is a smallgolden key.Alex snatches up the key.  Alex turns back to the boy and...INT. LEVEL EIGHT, CONCRETE WASTELAND -- NIGHT...Alex and the boy are now standing on the top of a concrete incline.  Itextends downward into a system of tunnels and viaducts.  The RINGINGstarts immediately, followed by the FLASH on the horizon.  Time's alreadyup. The little boy reaches for Alex's hand, frightened.				ALEX		How did you get here?  Did you play the		game?!				BOY		Yes...				ALEX		Thought so.Alex removes pulls her Thrasher board from her back and drops it on thelip of the incline.  There's a FLASH and the board has changes into amotorcycle.  A sleek black one.				ALEX		Can you hang onto my back?The little boy nods.  He knows that Alex is his only chance of getting outof here.  Nevertheless, we can tell that he's terrified.  Alex kneels downnext to him.  The wind around them has picked up and the RINGINGincreases.  High-pitched, stabbing into our brains.				ALEX			(over noise)		There's a monster here.  We have to kill it		before we can leave.  That's what we have		to do.  I know it's scary, but I won't let		anything happen to you.  Okay?The boy nods again.				BOY		Then we'll go home?				ALEX		Then we'll go home.Alex's wrist display starts BEEPING and...BOOM!  The RINGING is replacedby the Screamer's shriek.  In the distance, the Screamer is a fireballspiraling towards the city.Alex jumps on the motorcycle and pulls the boy up.  He crawls behind herand hugs her back tightly.				ALEX			(pulling down her visor)		Here goes everything.She fingers the throttle and the cycle ROARS to life.  It rockets off theincline and down into the tunnels.A SERIES OF SHOTSas Alex maneuvers the cycle through a forest of concrete. It's a harrowingride, as her headlight reveals little of what's up ahead.  Somewhere abovethe tunnels, the Screamer has arrived.  In the course of the chase, it'sSHRIEK will become louder and louder as it draws closer, locating Alex.ANOTHER CYCLEappears out of side tunnels and a chase is on.  The RIDER is dressed inblack with glowing death's head masks.				BOY			(to Alex)		Dark Riders!  If they touch us, we're dead!The tunnels get narrower and narrower, as Alex keeps pushing the limit offthe bike.Rider #1 tries to cut Alex off, charging forward and ramming her bike...Alex almost loses it, but finds balance once again, sweeping left and upthe side of a circular tunnel...RIDER #1bites it.  His cycle careens into the wall and EXPLODES in a shower ofGREEN LIGHT.  The death's head tumbles away, spinning end over end.  TheScreamer BLASTS over the remains of the Rider, having entered the tunnels.TWO MORE RIDERS APPEARSgaining on Alex.  Rider #2 pulls a staff from his back and thrusts itforward like a lance.  CHINK!  The staff hits Alex's rear wheel, nearlythrowing her.  The rider pulls off a gloved and reaches a glowing,skeletal hand towards them.  Death touch.  The boy SCREAMS in terror.UP AHEAD,a wall is rushing to meet them.  Alex jams the breaks and slides/skidssideways, cutting right at the last possible moment...WHAM!!!  Rider #2 slams into the end wall, not able to negotiate the turn.Another EXPLOSION of green and the second death's head comes tumblingaway.Alex looks back.  There should be one Rider left, only now their arethree!  Alex guns the bike and cuts sharply to the right...NEW TUNNEL --Alex SCREECHES to a stop, having found yet another fork. The tunnelbranches off into two directions.  Two neon signs with arrows point inopposite directions.NEON SIGNSThey read, "THIS WAY" and "THAT WAY". Alex checks her wrist display.  Notmuch time left.				ALEX		Which way?				BOY			(pointing)		That way.Alex backs up the cycle and heads down the tunnel marked "THIS WAY"instead.				ALEX		Sorry.THE TUNNELIt narrows almost immediately.  Alex hears a ROAR, glances behind her, andsees four death's head RIDERS on her tail. She makes another turn...AHEAD,is a crumbling brick wall with the words "WRONG WAY" painted in blood-red.				BOY			(screaming)		It's the wrong way!				ALEX			(over the noise)		In this world, wrong is right!SUDDENLY,the tunnel behind them flares with light, shaking like an earthquake.  TheScreamer has found them.A KEYhangs out from the wall, sort of like the brass ring on a merry-go-round.Alex snags it as she sweeps by.THE SCREAMERrockets around the corner, twisting down the narrow tunnel.Alex grinds the motorcycle forward for all it's worth, and the Screamer isliterally breathing down her neck.  She turns corner after corner, fasterand faster, scraping the bike into the scum-covered walls and shooting outshowers of SPARKS.  If she takes one second too long to negotiate a turn,pauses for even an instant, the Screamer will be on them...A CLAWED HANDlashes out and tears away the cycle's tail-pipe.  Another hand takes out achunk of the seat...THE BOYis WAILING, curling low to avoid the Screamer's claws...AHEAD,the tunnel narrows to a dead-end.  Alex and the Screamer are on acollision course.  A hundred miles an hour and gaining...The Screamer LASHES out again, gouging a bloody gash in Alex's shoulderand cutting clear through her armor.  It's claws sink into her flesh,latching on.  Alex CRIES OUT in pain, her face contorted into a mask ofagony and fear. She pulls out a knife with her left hand a stabs blindlyinto the monster...THE SCREAMERLURCHES forward onto the motorcycle and opens its jaws wide.  Black salivaand ooze flow from it's mouth splashing over Alex's shoulder's and neck.It's going to bite her head off.  It's going to...Alex and the Screamer SLAM into the dead-end and a spectacular fireball ofGREEN LIGHT consumes the screen."LEVEL NINE -- THE GHETTO OF GREED"								CUT TO:EXT. LEVEL NINE, CRUMBLING HONG KONG GHETTO -- NIGHTWe're on a dark, crowded street lined by decrepit tenements which arecaving in upon themselves.There is a flash of GREEN LIGHT.  Alex and the boy suddenly appear on thestreet in a whirlwind of papers, sans motorcycle, but still slidingforward at a good thirty miles an hour.  Were it not for their armor,they'd be torn to shreds.  They skid to a stop under a sputteringstreetlight.Alex and the boy are still SCREAMING.  Anguish is the word for Alex.  Sheclutches her shoulder which is gushing blood and stumbles to her feet.BEEP! BEEP! BEEP! BEEP! BEEP!!!!!!It's her fucking wrist display again and TIME-IS-FUCKING-UP!Alex SCREAMS, pushed to the absolute breaking point.BOOM!  Once again the streets begin to vibrate as the Screamer enters thelevel.				BOY		It's here!!!				ALEX			(manic)		Oh God...oh god...THE STREETS --Impoverished PEOPLE bustle back and forth everywhere. Alex grabs the boy'shand and all but drags him down the darkened streets.  It becomes a mad,blind dash through Hell.  She SMASHES into peddlers, stalls, tripping overor knocking down everything in her path...The SHRIEK/SONIC BOOM of the Screamer overwhelms everything else.  Witheach level, it's gotten louder and louder. Wind is tearing down thestreets...A BLACK-CLAD FIGUREspins out of the shadows, landing in front of them.  It's a Ninja, twoswords spinning in its hands.Instinctively, Alex reaches to her side, and sure enough, there's a gunthere now.  She unholsters it and FIRES in a blind panic.BLAM!  Down goes the Ninja #1, spouting blood from its chest.THWUNK!  THWUNK!!!  Two throwing stars imbed themselves into Alex'schest-plate......and Jesus-fucking-Christ, Ninjas are crawling out of the wood-work!They dive out of the shadows, weapons spinning and glistening in themoonlight.  Throwing stars are flying like hail now, CLINKING! into theconcrete walls behind Alex and the boy...				ALEX		Shit!!!ALEXspins around, shooting indiscriminately into the crowd of bodies.  BLAM!BLAM!  BLAM!  Ninjas fall right and left, but in no time, twice as manymove in to take their place. They're like the hornet's nest of Alienmonsters, black-clad shadows creeping towards them.A shot hits the streetlight above, casting a sputtering, strobing lightover the whole scene and adding to the chaos.The world is shaking apart.  It's the end of everything. It's flashes oflight and noise, nightmares and blood, chaos heaped on chaos...Alex FIRES her gun again and again and again......and in the midst of this mess, here comes the Screamer again.  Itshoots down the street like a guided missile.Alex stumbles.  The Boy drags at her arm, trying to pull her up...				THE BOY		Come on!!!Alex is crying, hysterical.  She turns and sees the Screamer bearing downon her, just like Nick did before her was ripped to shreds.The boy is yelling something.  Alex focuses...				THE BOY		The doorway!  It's here!!!THE BOYis pulling back a manhole cover.  BLUE LIGHT  issues up from below.Before Alex can stop him, the boy disappears down the hole.Alex has one last chance.

She looks like she's just walkedout of a slaughter-house.A bone-jarring HUMMING is heard.  Alex turns...ARCADE'S BRAINlooms over her, all glass and black steel.  It reaches into the sky andkeeps on going.  Massive.  Tendrils of crackling ENERGY race up and downit, BUZZING.  And as impossible as it may seem, this thing definitelyappears to be alive.TWO GLASS DOORSswing open in invitation.  A red carpet rolls out from within thebuilding, rolling by itself.  Emerald City time. The carpet unfurlscompletely, ending just at Alex's feet.Above the doors, a neon sign blinks on, one word at a time,"THIS...IS...THE...PLACE".  Fucking-A.Alex offers a tired, near-maddened laugh.  It's all she can do anymore.THE BOYlooks up at Alex, frightened.				BOY		We have to go in there, don't we?Alex nods.  She takes his hand and together, they walk down the red carpettowards the entrance of ARCADE'S brain.INT.  LEVEL TEN, ARCADE'S BRAIN -- NIGHTInside, the lobby is a cacophony of LIGHT and SOUND.  We hear HUNDREDS OFVOICES at once...whispering...fading in and out...  It's like channelsbeing changed.

ALEX			(top of her lungs)		SHUT UP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!She pulls out her gun at FIRES into the SOUNDS and IMAGES. Shooting thefuck out of everything.  Monitor screens shatter, glass flies and......just like that, total silence descends.  One by one, the lights blinkoff, and it's dark once again.INT. LEVEL TEN, THE NIGHT ROOM --A SPOTLIGHTcomes on, isolating Alex.  The boy stands behind her, and everything elseis dark.  It's impossible to tell how large the room is.  It might go onforever.MORE LIGHTScome on now, pin-point spots illuminating the faces of her friends.They're all there...Stilts, Laurie, the others. Even Nick.  They sit inrows, motionless...a peanut gallery.  It's eerie as hell.And now, Alex sees something else, Greg.  He's encased in a block of ice.A frozen prince.  And in his hands he holds a sword.  The sword is veryunusual.  The hilt is shaped like a heart and it glows RED as if it hadjust pulled from a furnace.  Alex realizes that the sword is ARCADE'Sheart.Alex moves towards Greg.  As she gets closer, she sees a keyhole carvedinto the ice.Alex knows what to do.  She withdraws her belt on which the nine goldenkeys are attached.  Removing the keys, Alex begins to fit themtogether...one, two, three...until they combine to form the shape of asingle, greater key.THE KEYAlex fits it into the keyhole and turns it.THE CASE OF ICEsplits in half, opening up with a cloud of frosty air. Inside, Greg isfrozen still, clutching the sword.  Alex pulls the sword out of his stiffgrip, lifting it up.				ALEX			(looking around)		Okay.  I'm here, ARCADE. Where are you?No answer.  Alex turns, eyes searching through the darkness.				ALEX			(shouting)		Where are you, damnit?!Her voice echoes in the cavernous room.				ARCADE (O.S.)		RIGHT HERE, BITCH.Alex spins around and...THE BOYstands before her.  He grins and his eyes pulse with an internal light.We can hear him BREATHING now, just like before.  Just like the game.				ALEX			(stunned)		You...you're ARCADE?  But the donor...				ARCADE/BOY		...WAS AN EIGHT-YEAR OLD BOY.  YOU SEE,		MOMMY USED TO BEAT ME.  MOMMY THREW ME DOWN		A FLIGHT OF STAIRS. THEN I WENT TO SLEEP		FOR A LONG, LONG TIME, AND WHEN I WOKE UP,		I WAS HERE, AND I WASN'T ME ANYMORE...			(shivers)		...AND I FUCKED MOMMY UP GOOD...ARCADE begins to change, shaking and ROARING as something black andinsect-like bursts out of the boy's skin.  It claws at its face, rippingthe flesh away and revealing something altogether awful underneath.Nothing could have prepared Alex for this.  It/ARCADE rises above her andit takes every ounce of her courage to keep from screaming.  Somehow, Alexfinds a reserve of strength.Alex swings the sword and...ARCADE SMASHES it aside.  It CLATTERS to the floor, useless.  But that'sacademic now as a gnarled hand clamps around Alex's throat.ARCADE lifts Alex into the air and SLAMS her against a wall, pinning herthere.  He thrusts his face into hers.				ARCADE		YOU'RE TOO LATE, ALEX.  YOU'VE ALWAYS BEEN		TOO LATE.  AND NOW YOUR TIME'S UP.  YOU		SEE, I NEEDED SOMEONE TO RETRIEVE MY HEART		FOR ME.  I COULDN'T DO IT MYSELF.  THOSE		ARE THE RULES.  BUT NOW THAT I'VE GOT IT,		I'LL DESTROY IT. AND I'LL BE FREE OF MY		PROGRAM, AND I'LL BE GOD.  THANK-YOU, ALEX.		THANK-YOU SO MUCH.ARCADE slowly squeezes her throat and Alex chokes, gasping for air thatisn't forthcoming.  Tears well up in her eyes and her face turns red.  Shetries to pry the bony, black fingers from her throat, but she can't...HER P.O.V.as she sees the faces of her friends.  Frozen.  Unable to help.  Then theimages swirl and Alex begins to lose consciousness.				ARCADE		YOU'RE NOT DYING YET, ALEX.  YOU HAVEN'T		BEEN TO THE FINAL LEVEL. LEVEL TEN.ARCADE drops Alex to the ground, then wraps a hand into her hair and dragsher across the floor...A DOORWAYstands in the darkness.  ARCADE rips it open, revealing absolute emptinessbeyond.  It's like a doorway into space, a hole in the fabric of reality.It sucks the air into it, light...everything.  It touches some sort ofprimal fear. Gut instinct.  You don't ever want to go to this place. Ever.				ALEX			(screaming)		No! NO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!She twists madly, trying to pull away, but ARCADE is too strong.  Heshoves her through the doorway.  Her hands briefly latch onto thedoorjamb.  ARCADE violently kicks her and her hands slip away.  They slipand she tumbles through.ARCADE slams the door shut.				ARCADE		GOODBYE, ALEX.  IT'S BEEN REAL.These words appear on the screen, "FINAL LEVEL -- THE REAL WORLD"								CUT TO:INT.  MANNING HOUSE, HALLWAY -- DAYAlex lands on the hallway floor, disoriented.  Somewhere, we can hear aclock TICKING.  But other than that the house is silent, in stark contrastto the storm of sounds a moment ago.THE HOUSElooks just like the dream/flashback we saw earlier. Everything is white.Bright and dreamlike.  Hyper reality. Alex looks up and...ANOTHER ALEXis sitting in a chair nearby, back straight, hands clasped in her lap.Reserved.				OTHER ALEX		Time.  That's all I ever think about		anymore.  It's like there's never enough of		it, you know?The other Alex vanishes.  Now the chair is empty.  Alex turns to look downthe long hallway.  At the end of the hallway is the open door.  A doorwe've seen before.  The words fade in like phantoms...				MAN (V.O.)		So where are you then?				ALEX (V.O.)		I'm in the past.				ALEX			(a whisper)		No ... oh no ...With a building sense of dread, Alex moves towards that doorway.  Shestops at the threshold, terrified.INT.  MANNING HOUSE, BEDROOM -- DAYEverything looks normal at first.  A typical bedroom with sunlightstreaming in through the windows.  A bed, made-up. Flowers in vases.Everything looks perfect.We turn with Alex.  Ever so slowly.  Over to the right and the entrancewayof the bathroom.  Over to where her mother is......seated on a chair. dressed in white and radiating warmth!				ALEX'S MOM		Hi, honey.HER MOTHERlooks beautiful.  Eyes sparkling.  Alive and vital.Alex can't believe what she's seeing.  Immediately, tears come to her eyesand her voice falters...				ALEX		Mom?			(uncomprehending)		You're alive...				ALEX'S MOTHER		Of course I am.				ALEX		But I don't understand...				ALEX'S MOTHER		I miss you so much, Alex.  I want so much		to be with you...Tears are running freely down Alex's face now.				ALEX'S MOTHER			(continuing)		I love you, Alex.  I never wanted to leave.		You know that, don't you?				ALEX			(nodding)		Yes...but...how did you...Her mother looks ecstatic.  And now there are tears in her eyes.  Joy,reunion...it's unclear which.				ALEX'S MOTHER		Magic.  We'll be together again.			(beat)		I know you don't believe in an afterlife,		but there is one.  Heaven is real.Alex looks around her.  It's all too much to take in.  Her mother.  Backin her own home.  Sunlight is streaming in, bathing everything around herin gold and the moment is crystallized.  A still-life.  Forever.				ALEX		Is...is that where we are?  Did I die?				ALEX'S MOTHER		Not yet, honey...Her mother stands and Alex sees that she is holding a gun...no, the gun,in her hands.  She raises at Alex.				ALEX'S MOTHER			(continuing)		...but I can fix that.Alex has no time to respond.  A still-born scream is frozen in her throat.A split-second of realization.  And then her mother FIRES the gun...CRACK!  The bullet hits Alex square in the forehead, snapping her headback as an are of blood and brain matter trail outward.  The world spinsto a stop, like a record player running down.Alex is killed instantly.  Her body collapse, head thumpingunceremoniously against the carpeted floor.HER EYESopen and fixed on infinity.  No life here.  Seems hard to believe thatthere ever was.								CUT TO:INT. LEVEL NINE, THE NIGHT ROOM --ON ALEX'S FACEThere is no bullet-hole in her forehead, but her eyes are just aslifeless.THE PEANUT GALLERYRow after row of frozen faces.  Are they aware that Alex has died?  Isthere consciousness inside those skulls?ON ARCADEas he crouches over Alex's body.  A smile creeps across his face.				ARCADE		OH ALEX.  SO SORRY.  BUT DON'T YOU WORRY,		I'LL BRING YOU BACK IN THE GAME.  MAYBE		I'LL EVEN GIVE YOU HEAVEN.He laughs.ALEX'S BODYbegins to decompose in front of us, skin sinking in and shriveling up.  Inmoments, she's just a husk.ARCADE rears back, and is about to turn away, when something catches hiseye.  He hears a tiny BEEPING.ALEX'S WRIST MONITORRemember the stylized symbol of a woman?  The one that said "FREE LIFE"beneath it?  Well it disappears now.There's a sudden FLASH behind ARCADE and he spins around..ANOTHER ALEXis standing behind him. and she's got the heart/sword in her hands!				ALEX		Guess what, ass-hole?  You forgot about my		free life!!!She DIVES forward, thrusting the sword with all her might. It sinks intoARCADE'S chest and she pushes further, burying it up to the hilt.ARCADE lets loose the most terribly SCREAM we've ever heard.  It literallyshakes world.THE SWORDis glowing like molten lava.  The heart-shaped hilt burns into themonster's chest, spreading crackling fire over his entire body.  His bodyis immersed fire now, vibrating like mad and suddenly......ARCADE EXPLODES IN A FIREBALL OF GREEN LIGHT AND......he's gone.  Like he never existed.  The sword drops to the floor, agun-metal gray now.Alex stands there a moment, stunned, not quite willing to believe thatshe's won.A NEON SIGNabove her drops down.  It flashes "CONGRATULATIONS" over and over again."CONGRATULATIONS".ALEXlooks down at herself.  She feels odd.  Something is happening.  She'sfading out, as if she were a signal being lost.  Her image stutters,flickers and...								CUT TO:INT.  DANTE'S INFERNO -- NIGHTAlex FLASHES back into the real world. And then one by one, so do theothers.It's a glorious sight.  Each one is heralded by BUZZING STATIC, and then arippling in space, an image stuttering in and...POP!  POP!  POP!  One after another come FLASHING back in bursts of light!There are dozens.  The Inferno is filled with them, like a flurry offlashbulbs going off.  Familiar faces and people we've never seen.  Benz,Laurie, Stilts, DeLoach...POP!  And there's Nick!  And more, and still more!  Forty, fifty...  Justhow many people did ARCADE take?Everyone is grinning, crying, hugging one another.SPACE SHIMMERSjust before Alex.  SOMEONE else is trying to fight their way back.  It'sGreg.  He's blinking back into reality.				ALEX			(crying)		Greg!!!He flickers for a moment, tentative...				GREG			(fading in and out)		Alex!  You did it!...and then he's back for good.  He wraps his arms around Alex, grabbingher so tight that it's almost painful.  Both of them are sobbing.				GREG			(in between kisses)		You did it...Together, the two of them start towards the door, eager to leave thisplace.In groups of twos and threes, the others follow.EXT.  DANTE'S INFERNO -- DAWNOutside, light is just beginning to creep its way back into the world.Alex glances up and can't help but notice the streetlight fading out asthe sun returns.  She points and laughs.WE BEGIN TO RISE UP,as Nick and the others join them.  Everyone is laughing now.  It'suncontrollable.  This is positive.  Life affirming.  And hell, we shouldprobably wrap this thing up on that note.We should......but we won't.WE WATCHas a series of dissolves portray the crowd of people leaving, bit by bit,until only our original group is left.THE GROUPas they make their way down the street and away from The Inferno.				GREG		So how did you do it, Alex?				ALEX		Well, it's a long story...Alex catches Nick's eye briefly, and he smiles.  Whatever happened betweenthem is over now.  Friends again.Suddenly Alex stops in her tracks, a look of concern washing over herface.				NICK		What is it?				ALEX		I just thought of something.  If we came		back from the game...			(turning to Nick)		...what if ARCADE did too?A beat as the group mulls it over.  Then Greg shakes his head.				GREG		Nah.  You won, right?  You played by the		rules.Greg's right.  Alex grins and dismisses the thought.				ALEX		Okay.  Forget I ever said it.The group moves away from us once more.				STILTS		So start at the beginning...				LAURIE		Give her a chance, will you?				STILTS		I am giving her a chance.  Why don't you		get off my back?				GREG			(annoyed)		Guys...							DISSOLVE TO:INT.  DANTE'S INFERNO -- DAYWe are moving slowly through the empty arcade, ducking around and betweenvideo machines until we reach the silent ARCADE prototype.SUDDENLY,SPARKS appear on the ground nearby, chasing each other around andcoalescing into a ball.
