She's carrying books and looking very collegiate.A black stretch LIMOUSINE with darkened windows drives past,SLAMS ON ITS BRAKES, and backs up. The Young Woman stares ather reflection in the windows, wondering what this is allabout.Finally, the REAR PASSENGER WINDOW zips down, revealing LLOYDCHRISTMAS, age 30. He's a pleasant-enough looking guy, if alittle shaggy. He's wearing a dark suit.                       LLOYD           Excuse me, can you tell me how to           get to the medical school? I'm           supposed to be giving a lecture in           twenty minutes and my driver's a bit           lost.

LLOYD           I couldn't help noticing the accent.           You from Jersey?                       YOUNG WOMAN               (unimpressed)           Austria.

MUTT CUTS DOG SALON - DAYThis building is white with black spots on it, like aDALMATION. Over the front door is an awning shaped like aDOG'S SNOUT, whiskers included. A van pulls up outside.The vehicle is decorated like a GIANT POODLE, with four legshanging off the sides, a tail in the rear, and a dog's snouton the front grill. MUTT CUTS is written on the side of it.HARRY DUNNE climbs out. He's in his early 30s and dressed ina ridiculous BEAGLE COSTUME, including a CAP WITH FLOPPYEARS. He goes to the rear of the van, opens it, and a swarmof DOGS pile out.                        HARRY            Okay, gang, single file. You know            the rules: No pushing, no humping,            and no sniffing heinies...                                                           3.The door to the shop opens and Harry's annoyed boss, MR.PALMER, sticks his head out.                      PALMER          Hey, why aren't those mutts on          leashes?                      HARRY          The same reason you're not on a leash,          sir because it's demeaning and it          chafes like hell.                      PALMER          Just get them in here now! They all          have to be bathed and clipped in an          hour.Palmer disappears back inside. Harry CALLS to the dogs butthey pay no attention. He struggles to keep them fromwandering off. He grabs a couple of SMALL POOCHES and sitsthem on a wall.                      HARRY          You kids stay right here...As he turns to round up the other, we discover that the wallisn't a wall it's a flatbed truck. The truck drives away,taking the two dogs with it.                      HARRY (CONT'D)              (at truck)          Hey, wait a minute!Harry chases after the vehicle.                                                     CUT TO:EXT. EAST SIDE ESTATE - DAYLloyd Christmas pulls the limousine into a long, tree-lineddriveway. He gets out and looks up in awe at an IMPRESSIVESTONE MANSION. He WHISTLES to himself, then walks to thefront oor and RINGS THE BELL.The double-front doors of the mansion open and MARY SWANSONappears. She's 25 and gorgeous. Lloyd's jaw drops open whenhe lays eyes on her.                      MARY          Hello.              (beat)          I'll be just a minute...                                                          4.As Mary steps back inside, Lloyd takes out a tiny can ofBinaca. He sprays his mouth, under his arms, his hair, behindhis ears...                                                     CUT TO:INT. LIMO - DAYLloyd is driving and Mary is in the back, looking out thewindow, lost in thought. She's got a BRIEFCASE resting onher lap and she fingers the leather nervously. Lloyd keepsglancing at her in the rear-view mirror, but for a moment heis speechless. Then:                      LLOYD          Why you going to the airport? Flying          somewhere?                      MARY              (dead-pan)          How'd you guess?                      LLOYD          Well, I saw your luggage, then when          I noticed the airline ticket, I put          two and two together.              (beat)          So where you heading?                      MARY          Aspen.                      LLOYD          Oh, you're gonna love it. I hear          California's beautiful this time of          year.Mary looks back out the window and Lloyd sneaks anotherglance.                      LLOYD (CONT'D)          Name's Christmas. Lloyd Christmas.                      MARY          I'm Mary.ON LLOYD - we can almost see his mind work. He's desperateto impress her.                      LLOYD          Uh, this isn't my real job, you know.          It's only temporary.                                                         5.                         MARY          Oh?                      LLOYD          Yeah, you see, my friend Harry and I          are saving up our money so we can          open our own pet store.                         MARY          That's nice.                       LLOYD              (smiling)          I got worms.                      MARY          I beg your pardon?                      LLOYD          That's what we're gonna call it: I          Got Worms. We're gonna specialize in          selling worm farms you know, like          ant farms. A lot of people don't          realize that worms make much better          pets than ants. They're quiet,          affectionate, they don't bite, and          they're super with the kids.                      MARY          Aren't ants quiet, too?Lloyd realizes she has a point.                        LLOYD          Uh... well, sure but they aren't half          as affectionate. And if you cut an          ant's head off, it won't grow back.                         MARY          I see.                      LLOYD          And best of all, worm farming is a          seventy-five-thousand-dollar-a-year          industry. I wouldn't mind having a          piece of that pie, if you know what          I mean.To her credit, she doesn't. They continue driving. Mary looksat her watch and crosses her legs. Lloyd can see that she'sconcerned about something.                                                            6.                      LLOYD (CONT'D)          What's the matter? Little tense about          the flight?                      MARY              (beat)          Something like that.Lloyd SWIVELS AROUND and STARES over his shoulder at her.                      LLOYD          It's really nothing to worry about,          Mary. Statistically, they say you're          more likely to get killed on the way          to the airport. You know, like in a          head-on crash, or something.                      MARY          Um, Lloyd, could please keep your          eyes on the road.                      LLOYD          Good thinking. There's a lot of bad          rivers out there.Lloyd turns back to the steering wheel.                                                     CUT TO:EXT. AIRPORT - DAYLloyd is putting the last bags on a cart. He closes the trunkand turns to Mary. She looks nervous and disconcerted as shereaches into her purse. She pulls out a ten-dollar tip.                         MARY          Here you go.                      LLOYD          Keep it. It was my pleasure.For the first time, Mary Swanson offers a slight smile. Thismakes her more lovely than ever.                      LLOYD (CONT'D)          Relax, Mary. Just get trashed and          pass out. You'll be there before you          know it.                      MARY          Thanks Lloyd.              (beat)          And good luck with your worms.                                                            7.Then she PICKS UP HER BRIEFCASE and walks into the terminal,followed by a PORTER pushing her bags. Lloyd watches her,ENCHANTED, until she's out of sight.Afterwards, he climbs back into the limo,  LOVESICK. For amoment he doesn't even have the energy to  turn the key. Hejust drops his head against the steering  wheel, DEVASTATED.There's a TAP on the window. Lloyd looks  up to see a POLICEOFFICER standing there.                      POLICE OFFICER          Come on, move it, you're in a red          zone.Lloyd starts the limo and pulls away.                                                      CUT TO:INT. AIRPORT TERMINAL - DAYMary looks tense as she moves through the throngs oftravelers. Her pace is slow, deliberate, and her eyes arefocused straight ahead.She passes a row of phone botths and two MEN one dressed inan ARMANI SUIT, the other in a PLAID SPORTCOAT watch her.                       ARMANI SUIT          She's gonna leave the briefcase at          the foot of the escalator. You make          the pick-up.                      PLAID SPORTCOAT          Piece of cake.EXT. AIRPORT TERMINAL - DAYAs Lloyd pulls his limo slowly away, he glances in the airportwindow and SEES MARYWALKING ALONG.When she stops at the foot of the escalator, he stops, too.She puts down the briefcase and checks her coat pocket forher ticket. Lloyd's attention is distracted by a HONK. Heturns to see a car irectly behind him.                      LLOYD              (to car's driver)          Drive around me, you pinhead!When he turns back to watch Mary in the terminal he seesthat SHE'S GONE, and she's LEFT HER BRIEFCASE AT THE FOOT OFTHE STAIRS. Lloyd jumps to ATTENTION.                                                           8.He pulls the car into a HANDICAPPED SPOT and hops out. Hestarts to run into the terminal, then notices the PoliceOfficer and suddenly goes into a spastic walk, limping anddragging him leg behind him like a palsy victim.INT. AIRPORT TERMINALThe Armani Man nods to the Plaid Sportcoat and he starts toapproach the briefcase. Just as Plaid Sportcoat is reachingfor the handle, LLOYD RUNS BY AND GRABS IT. He CONTINUES UPTHE ESCALATOR three steps at a time. The two men look ateach other, dumbstruck.INT. AIRPORT TERMINAL - BOARDING GATELloyd runs with the briefcase to the TV monitors that postthe departure times. He looks frantically at the confusionof numbers.

He starts walking down the sidewalkwhen suddenly he STOPS IN HIS TRACKS.HIS POV - his limo is being towed away    under the supervisionof the Police Officer.He takes off after it, but to no avail.                      LLOYD          You can't do this! I'll lose my job!As Lloyd watches the limo get towed out of site, he runs hisfingers through his hair.

Harry's caged parakeet, PETEY,tweets hello, but the two   guys just sit there SILENTLY.The place is a mess. Wallpaper's peeling off the walls. Thecarpet is threadbare and filthy.

HARRY            Yeah, and go where?                        LLOYD            I'll tell you where: someplace warm,            a place where the beer flows like            wine, where beautiful women            instinctively flock like the salmon            of Capistrano.                (dramatic PAUSE)            I'm talking about Aspen.                        HARRY            Aspen?

Or do you want to enjoy          your life?              (beat)          Come on, Harry, don't let Petey's          eath be in vain. Don't you see what          he was saying? Spread your wings,          man. he was saying? Spread your wings,          man. Fly.                      HARRY              (confused)          What are you talking about, Lloyd?          His head fell off.              (dawning realization)          Wait a second, I know what you're up          to. You just wanna go to Aspen so          you can find that girl who lost her          briefcase and you need me to drive          you there.                      LLOYD          That's bullshit. I'll drive.              (beat)          And what's so wrong about going          someplace where we know someone who          can plug us into the social pipeline?                      HARRY              (torn)          I don't know, Lloyd. I think we should          stay here, hunt for jobs, and keep          saving money for the worm store. I'm          getting a little sick and tired of          always running from creditors.Lloyd moves to the window and looks out at the gray, wintrycityscape.                      LLOYD          You know what I'm sick and tired of,          Harry? I'm sick and tired of having          to eek my way through life.

He opens his arms wide.                      HARRY          Come on, Lloyd. Give us a kiss.                      LLOYD          On the other hand, maybe you're right,          Harry. Maybe we should stay here and          try our luck in bankruptcy court.          With all those lawsuits against us,          I'm sure we'll win at least one. It          could be a boost to our egos.Harry sees that Lloyd has a point. He stands and approachesPetey's cage. His eyes fill with tears.                         HARRY                 (emotional)          Petey, I made a promise to you once,          man...

We huddled          together all night, and we made an          oath that if we ever got out of there          alive we'd never ever leave each          other's side again.

HARRY (CONT'D)           You know, Lloyd, I think you might've           gone a little overboard with the           spending today.He blows out the twenty and tosses it off the balcony.                       LLOYD           What's the big deal? We're gonna pay           it all back anyway, right?                       HARRY           Sure, but do you really think you           needed to buy those two surfboards?                       LLOYD           Surfboards? I thought those were           beginner's skis.This suddenly makes sense to Harry.                       HARRY           Ahhh. I was wondering why you had           those bindings put on them.Lloyd opens a box and holds up a SCANTY NEGLIGEE.                       LLOYD           Where'd this come from?                        HARRY               (sheepishly)           I bought it.                       LLOYD           What for?                                                        79.                        HARRY          I like the feel of it against my          skin...                (defensive)          ...I mean, you know, when a woman's          wearing it.Lloyd inspects it more closely.                      LLOYD          Harry, how many women do you know          who wear a size XXL?                      HARRY          Look, leave me alone. I'm rich now.          I'm supposed to have a few          eccentricities.There's a KNOCK on the door.                      LLOYD          Enter, parlez vous!The Bell Captain, Barnard, ENTERS with a champagne bucketand a newspaper under his arm.                      BARNARD          I brought you your newspaper and          some champagne, gentlemen.          Unfortunately, we didn't seem to          have the, um, label you requested.Lloyd examines the champagne's label and frowns.                      LLOYD          All out of Boone's Farm, huh?                      BARNARD          You have a rapier wit, sir. I took          the liberty of bringing a comparable          substitute: Dom Perignon.                      LLOYD          Guess it'll have to do, slugger, eh?Lloyd smiles and over tips him.                      BARNARD          Thank you so much, sir.He puts the tray down, hands Lloyd the newspaper, and headsfor the door.                                                         80.                      LLOYD          Oh, one more thing: You can     dispense          with the 'sir' crap. Let's     face it,          Barney, we're all from the     same mold.              (winks)          We just have a little more     dough          than you right now.Barnard smiles and EXITS. Harry comes back in the room. Hepicks up a champagne glass and flicks it with his finger,sending out a resonant RING.                      HARRY          Cocktail hour has commenced!He starts to open the champagne bottle as Lloyd beginsthumbing through the newspaper.                      HARRY (CONT'D)          Hey, later on what do you say we...?He notices that Lloyd's mouth has dropped open at somethinghe's found in the paper.                        HARRY (CONT'D)          Lloyd... you okay?                      LLOYD              (dumbstruck)          Harry, it's her.                       HARRY          Who?                      LLOYD          Mary with the briefcase. This is          her...He shoves the newspaper at Harry.CLOSE ON THE HEADLINE - it reads: SWANSONS TO HOSTPRESERVATION GALA TONIGHT; CITY'S ELITE EXPECTED. Underneaththis is a photograph of Mary with her parents.                      LLOYD (CONT'D)          Mary Swanson...                      HARRY          Come on, Cinderella, it's time to          get you ready for the ball...Roy Orbison's "Pretty Woman" plays over a...MONTAGE OF HARRY AND LLOYD'S GLAMOUR MAKE-OVER:                                                          81.-The boys are in a beauty parlor getting their hair shampooed.-Harry and Lloyd sit beneath old-fashioned hair dryers. TheATTENDANTS lift the dryers from their heads, revealing bothguys' hair in curlers.-Lloyd's getting shaved by an ATTENDANT with a straight-razor.Suddenly Lloyd grabs his neckas if he's been nicked. BLOOD SQUIRTS OUT from between hisfingers. The other CUSTOMERS stare in horror at this. LloydLAUGHS and shows everyone a SQUEEZE KETCHUP BOTTLE hidden inhis hand. Only Harry and Lloyd seem to find this joke amusing.-We see them getting their nose hairs clipped. PAN DOWN tothe floor to reveal a PILE OFNOSE HAIR CLIPPINGS.-Then a   shot of a MAN next to them getting a pedicure. PANOVER to   Lloyd's bare feet  he has toe nails like HowardHughes.   Sparks are flying as an ATTENDANT wearing safetygoggles   tries to sand down Lloyd's toenails with an electricsander.-Harry is lying on his stomach with his shirt off, getting amassage from a beautiful ORIENTAL MASSEUSE. He pulls a hundreddollar bill from under his towel, hands it to her, andWHISPERS in her ear. She smiles.-Next we see the Oriental Masseuse lying on her stomach withher shirt off, while Harry happily massages her back.-The guys are in an expensive haberdashery. Harry comes outof the dressing room in a very elegant BLACK TUXEDO. Hecouldn't look any more suave. The SALEMAN nods, impressed,but Lloyd shakes his head no and Harry goes back in.-Harry reappears in another stylish WHITE TUXEDO. The Salesmanlooks on hopefully, but Lloyd again disapproves.-This time Harry comes out in a JUNIOR-PROM-LIKE SKY-BLUETUXEDO, complete with TACKY FRILLS. The Salesman lookssickened as Lloyd give Harry the thumbs up.PAN ACROSS THE STREET from the haberdashery - an apprehensiveJ.P. Shay is sitting in a parked car, WATCHING HARRY ANDLLOYD.                                                  DISSOLVE TO:                                                           82.EXT. ASPEN PRESERVATION SOCIETY - NIGHTThrongs of GUESTS in black-tie and elegant gowns are enteringthe building. Suddenly the hearse pulls up with Harry andLloyd BUMPER SURFING BEHIND IT. Harry's wearing his bluetuxedo. Lloyd's tux isn't any better it's pumpkin orange.(THEY'VE GOT MATCHING TOP HATS AND CANES.) When the hearsestops, the boys hand the driver Barnard a couple hundreddollars.                      LLOYD          Thanks for the lift, Barney.INT. ASPEN PRESERVATION SOCIETYNicholas Andre is greeting people at the door. However, whenHarry and Lloyd try to enter, he stops them and gives themthe once over.                      ANDRE          Excuse me, gentlemen, but this is a          five-hundred-dollar-a-plate dinner.Harry and Lloyd look at each other and shrug. Then Lloydtakes out a WAD OF BILLS and peelsoff TEN HUNDREDS, much to the amazement of Andre.                      LLOYD          This should cover a couple plates.                      HARRY          I'm kind of hungry, Lloyd. What if          we want seconds?Lloyd thinks about this. Then he peels off another thou.                      LLOYD          Put us down for four plates, my good          man.They ENTER the party. As Andre watches them go, his associateJ.P. Shay comes up beside him, an alarmed look on his face.                      J.P. SHAY              (WHISPERING)          Jesus Christ, boss... it's them.BACK ON HARRY AND LLOYD - the guys make their way throughthe affluent crowd.                      LLOYD          I'm getting nervous, Harry.                                                        83.                      HARRY          relax, Lloyd. These people are just          like you and me.                      LLOYD          What are you talking about? They're          educated, well-bred, charming, and          sophisticated.                      HARRY          So what? We can be sophistica holy          shit, would you look at the fun bags          on that hose hound.He points out a busty BLONDE BOMBSHELL entering the party.Lloyd rolls his eyes.                      LLOYD          Don't do this to me, Harry. I'm          already a wreck. What if Mary oesn't          like me?                      HARRY          Look, let's just go saddle up to the          bar and down a couple bowls of          loudmouth soup. A little booze'll          bring back that old Lloyd Christmas          over-confidence.The guys stand out at the glittering social scene as theymake their way to the bar.                      LLOYD              (to BARTENDER)          Two martinis, straight up.As Harry and Lloyd silently take in the party, a BEAUTIFULRED HEAD reaches between them for a cocktail napkin, thenwalks away.                      LLOYD (CONT'D)          Shut up, Harry.                      HARRY          I didn't say anything.                      LLOYD          Yeah, well I know what you were gonna          say and I'm telling you to shut up          in advance.                      HARRY          How do you know what I was gonna          say?                                                        84.                      LLOYD          I read you like a book.                      HARRY          Okay, if you read me like a book          then what was I gonna say?                      LLOYD          You were gonna say:              (in Harry's looped               VOICE)          'That's one fiery bush I wouldn't          mind roasting my weenie in.'Harry raises his eyebrows, IMPRESSED.                       LLOYD (CONT'D)          And I would say 'shut up', because          this is our chance to get in with          the rich and powerful and you don't          ingratiate yourself to the kind of          people by acting like Ron Jeremy on          Spanish Fly.The Bartender delivers their martinis as we hear the o.s.CLINKING of a glass. The guys turns tosee Nicholas Andre standing at a podium. Next to him is aLARGE, COVERED DISPLAY. On his other side are Karl andElizabeth Swanson.                      ANDRE          If I could have your attention,          please...The crowd QUIETS.

MR. SWANSON          Ladies and gentlemen, I give you the          Icelandic Snow Owl.He pulls the cover off, revealing TWO MAJESTIC, FLUFFY WHITEOWLS IN A CAGE.

Enjoy.The crowd APPLAUDS and begins to mingle again. Lloyd turnsback to the Bartender and holds up his empty glass.                      LLOYD          Two more, please.Harry stares at Lloyd with concern.                      HARRY          Lloyd, I've never seen you this          uptight. You've gotta chill out.                      LLOYD          I can't help it. This is a very          important night for me.                      (MORE)                                                        86.                       LLOYD (CONT'D)              (beat)          Harry, have you ever wondered why          you and I never have long-term          girlfriends?                      HARRY          What are you talking about? I went          out with Fraida Felcher for two and          a half weeks.                      LLOYD          That was a fluke.              (beat)          The reason we never have long-term          girlfriends is because of one thing:          We're afraid of the C word.                      HARRY          That's crazy. We live for the C word.                      LLOYD          I'm talking bout commitment.                         HARRY                (beat)          Oh.                      LLOYD          Well I'm ready for commitment, Harry.          The first time I laid eyes on Mary          Swanson, I knew she was the one.              (beat)          Some things you feel in your heart,          other things you feel in your groin.          This girl makes me feel it all in          the heart.Suddenly Lloyd notices something across the room.HIS POV - A BEGUILING MARY SWANSON IS TALKING WITH A COUPLEOF GUESTS. SHE'S WEARING Aspectacular black cocktail dress.Lloyd quickly turns toward the bar.                      LLOYD (CONT'D)          Oh shit, there she is.                                                   87.                      HARRY              (checking her out)          Wow. You weren't kidding, Lloyd.          She's an angel.              (beat)          Well, what are you waiting for? Get          over there and talk to her.                      LLOYD          She's gonna think I'm some kind of          psycho when she realizes how far I          came just to see her.                      HARRY          You have her briefcase she's gonna          be thrilled to see you.                      LLOYD          And then what? She'll take it back          and that'll be it. I'm a nobody.Harry thinks about this a moment.                      HARRY          Look, man, you just drove two thousand          miles to see this girl. Don't quit          on the last fifty feet.                       LLOYD               (brightening)          Wait a second, I have an idea. You          go over and introduce yourself. That          way you can build me up so when I          come along I won't have to brag about          myself. Tell her I'm good-looking          and I'm rich and I have a rapist's          wit.                      HARRY          I can't tell her you're good looking,          Lloyd she's got eyes.Lloyd takes a big gulp of his new martini.                      LLOYD          Please Harry, I'm appealing to you          as one loser to another. Just build          me up and then give me a signal to          come over. Please.Harry SIGHS.                                                           88.                      HARRY          All right. But you're gonna owe me a          big one for this.Harry straightens his polka-dot bow-tie, then APPROACHESMary, who is now standing alone, admiring the owls.                      HARRY (CONT'D)          Nice set of hooters you got there.Mary turns to Harry, stunned.                      MARY          I beg your pardon?                      HARRY          The owls. They're beautiful.                      MARY          Oh. Yeah.              (beat)          Are you a bird lover?                      HARRY          Well, I used to have a parakeet, but          my main area of expertise is canines          that's dogs to the layperson.She smiles at this.                      MARY          Thanks. I love dogs, too. So howare you involved with them?                      HARRY          Oh, I've trained them, bathed them,          clipped them; I've even bred them.                      MARY          Really? Any unusual breeding?                      HARRY          Nah, mostly just doggie-style. But          one time we successfully mated a          Bulldog and a Shitzu.                      MARY          Really? That's weird.                      HARRY          Yeah. We called it a Bullshit.              (breaks out LAUGHING)          Just a little breeder joke.                                                           89.She seems strangely charmed by this.                      HARRY (CONT'D)          Anyway, the real reason I came over          is because I want to introduce you          to a friend of mine.Just then, Mary's stepmother approaches. She's holding amartini and looking a little sloshed.                      HELEN          Mary, I don't believe I've met your          friend.

LLOYD              (cutting)          Yeah, we used to be best friends.                      HARRY          Until he turned into a backstabber.                      LLOYD          Me a backstabber? You got a lot of          nerve. I saw her first.                      HARRY          Hey, I couldn't help it if she found          me irresistable.Mary ROLLS HER EYES at this.                      LLOYD          But you knew how crazy I was about          her.                      HARRY          Yeah, and you knew how crazy I was          about Fraida Felcher, but that didn't          stop you, did it?                      LLOYD              (waning righteousness)          What are you talking about?                      HARRY          Don't deny it, Lloyd. Fraida told me          the whole sordid story.Lloyd can't muster a defense.                      LLOYD          Look... I was gonna tell you about          that. It was gonna be mentioned at          the reading of my will. I swear, you          can ask my lawyer.Harry glares at him.                      HARRY          Well I guess we both learned a little          something about each other, didn't          we?                      LLOYD          You said it, pal. Maybe we're not as          good friends as we thought we were.                                                       113.                         HARRY          Guess not.                      LLOYD          I mean, if one beautiful girl   could          rip us apart like this, then   it seems          our friendship isn't worth a   damn.              (beat)          Maybe we should call it quits   right          here.                      HARRY          Just tell me where to sign, bud.Suddenly they hear the metallic CLICK-CLACK OF A GUN BEINGCOCKED.                      ANDRE          Okay, which one of you losers wants          to die first?The guys exchange a look and SWALLOW HARD.                      HARRY          I wouldn't pull that trigger if I          were you.                      ANDRE          Why not? It'll look like just another          Aspen love triangle. You caught the          two of them in bed, handcuffed them          to the post, murdered them, and killed          yourself.                      HARRY              (smug)          Except you're forgetting one minor          etail.                         ANDRE          What's that?Lloyd and Mary look at Harry, hopeful.                      HARRY          If you kill us, you'd be killing          yourself.                         ANDRE                 (puzzled)          Huh?                                                   114.                       HARRY           You see, philosophers believe that           we're all really just tiny pieces of           one huge universal being. In other           words, I am you and you are me, so           if you were to kill us you'd be           committing suicide, you unenlightenedidiot --                        ANDRE           --Shut up!Mary sees that they're in deep shit now.                       MARY           What about my husband? Did you kill           him, too?                       HARRY           Husband? What husband?                       LLOYD           Mary's married, Harry.                       ANDRE           No need to worry about Melvin.               (beat)           Now this is the last time I'll ask:           Who wants to die first?Harry gestures with his head at Mary.                       HARRY           Kill her. The bitch should've told           him she was married back at the           airport. It would've saved us a lot           of trouble.Andre points the gun at Mary.                       LLOYD           No, I'll go first, Harry. I was the           one who got you into this mess.Andre points the gun at Lloyd.                       HARRY           No, wait, do me first. I'm the one           who stole your girl, Lloyd. I eserve           it.                                                          115.Andre SIGHS and points the gun at Harry. Then, as Mary andLloyd look on in horror, he FIRES TWICE. Harry grabs hisstomach and falls off the bed to the floor.                      LLOYD          Jesus Christ! You killed my best          friend, you bastard!Andre smiles.                      ANDRE          If it's any consolation, you're about          to be reunited.He aims the gun at Lloyd, COCKS THE TRIGGER. Suddenly, aSHOT RINGS OUT and the gun is blown out of Andre's hand.ON THE FLOOR - Harry is very much alive and pointing a pistolat the stunned Nicholas Andre.                      LLOYD          Harry! You're alive!Just them, the door BURSTS OPEN and SEVERAL POLICE OFFICERSstorm in with their weapons drawn.                      COP #1          Get your hands up, asshole!Lloyd and Harry throw their hands into the air. A stunnedAndre turns to see six guns pointing at his head. Hereluctantly raises his hands. Mary and Lloyd are flabbergastedby the turn of events.There's a sudden commotion in the room. Pushing her waythrough the mass of cops comes the Athletic Beauty. Sheflashes an ID.

Harry opens his shirt,revealing a BULLET-PROOF VEST.                                                       116.                      HARRY          She grabbed me down in the lobby and          explained what was up. They slapped          this on me and gave me a gun.                      LLOYD              (to Athletic Beauty)          But how did you...?                      ATHLETIC   BEAUTY          We've been following   you two all the          way from Providence.

She was          efinitely worth the trip.                      LLOYD          Guess we have to admit it, she was          too good for us.Just then, a cruiser pulls up and Mary's husband jumps out.                      MELVIN          Oh god, baby, I missed you!Harry and Lloyd stare in wonder as MEL GIBSON climbs out ofthe car. Mary and Mel embrace, then Mel turns to the guys.                                                         117.                      MELVIN (CONT'D)          I can't thank you enough, fellas. It          was so darn dank in that well, I          really thought it would be the death          of me.Harry and Lloyd are too stunned to respond.

HARRY          And we're, um, sorry about the money          we gave you turning out to be phony.                      BELL CAPTAIN          Don't worry about it, gentlemen. The          Swanson family has promised to          reimburse everyone.This seems to please Lloyd and Harry. The hearse is deliveredto the front door.                      LLOYD          Well, anyway, thanks again for          everything.They turn to go, but Barnard CALLS TO THEM:                      BARNARD          Where are you two headed?                                                       118.                      HARRY          I dunno. I'm sure we'll find a trailer          camp somewhere to call home.                      BARNARD          Why not right here?Harry and Lloyd look at each other, confused.                      LLOYD          This joint is a little out of our          budget, Barney.
