ELLEN          Well, I'm sure it's not Christmas,          because you'd be worried about how          much money we don't have to spend          on each other... I know it's not          New Years, because you'd be going          on and on about wearing a tuxedo          and how much you don't like to          dance... and I'm sure it's not our          anniversary, because I didn't find          an envelope with a hundred dollars          cash on my bureau with a note that          says, 'Pick out something          pretty'...

ELLEN              (on the end of his words)          Kris, go to the pharmacy.  Ask Mr.          Donnavan to get you a large bottle          of Geritol...

ELLEN          They pick on you because they can          get a rise out of you... children          can sense those things.Kris quickly opens his black shoulder bag and pulls out amini-tape recorder.

ELLEN              (very emotional)          Sometimes people need to see things          done for them -- because sooner or          later they don't believe the words          anymore.

She stares at him in complete andutter disbelief.  She drills him with this iron glare for aneternity then grabs her purse and heads to the exit.  Mauricestares at the table for a moment to gather what's left of hisdignity and follows her out.The waiter moves to the table and clears the aftermath.

It just makes you feel good to do          something for it, to express your          pride and affection for it some          how...

If they had          said 'yes', you would be speaking          with them right now.This is the father's own room.  Very sparse as one wouldexpect.

MAURICE          You'll probably be bigger than your          brothers.                    ISAAC          Yeah!Isaac is happy with this thought.Maurice looks up as MRS. CALDWELL comes to the door.                    MRS. CALDWELL          Who are you talking to Isaac?Mrs. Caldwell stops as she stares at Maurice.                    MAURICE          Hello, I'm Maurice Parker.  I'm          just passing through and I need to          conserve what little funds I          have... I need some food and a roof          to sleep under for one night... Now          I don't look like much, but if          there are any things that need to          get done around the house --Mrs. Caldwell doesn't listen, but instead yells behind thedoor.                    MRS. CALDWELL          Dave... you're not going to believe          who's here.Maurice looks at her oddly.  MR. CALDWELL comes to the door;his face lights up.                    MRS. CALDWELL          This is Maurice Parker -- the one          walking for his wife.Mr. Caldwell is completely floored.  So, for that matter isMaurice.  Mr. Caldwell puts out his hand with awe.                    MR. CALDWELL          If that ain't fate?... Hi, I'm Dave          Caldwell.

The kind prepared for visitinggrandmothers and grandfathers to stay in.Maurice checks himself out in the mirror... his borrowedpajamas fit nicely.He moves to the window and stares at the moon litlandscape... enormous, endless, dwarfing.The rocking chair CREAKS as Maurice melts into it.  He rubshis calves slowly, the pain evident in his face.  His headleans back after a moment... on the verge of sleep.The SOUND OF TINY FOOTSTEPS stirs him.  He looks to thedoorway to find Isaac standing quietly at the door in hisbaseball P.J.s.                    MAURICE          I thought you were asleep.                    ISAAC          You know what... I remembered you          were here and I woke up.Isaac walks silently to Maurice... Tip-toeing all the way.                    MAURICE          Your parents would want you to be          in bed.                    ISAAC          You tell stories?                    MAURICE          Oh no... I'm not good at that.          Very bad in fact...Too late.  Isaac climbs up into Maurice's lap with greateffort.  Maurice looks down at Isaac who waits patiently forhim to begin.                    MAURICE          I would be exceedingly boring.Isaac waits.                    MAURICE          I don't do these type of things.Isaac -- still waiting.                    MAURICE          See there are two kinds of people          in this world.              (beat)          ... Just a short one okay?Isaac gets in position, cradled in Maurice's arms.  Mauricesearches for something to say.                    MAURICE          There was a boy named Isaac who          wanted to play baseball, but he was          too small and no one would let him          play... but he kept practicing by          himself -- waiting... He went to          every game and sat in the stands          with his glove.                    ISAAC          You know what... maybe I ran onto          the field and hit a home run.                    MAURICE          Who's telling this story?Isaac points to Maurice.                    MAURICE          Good, now the team had this great          big player -- Big Billy.  He was          the best.  He had them in the World          Super-Bowl-Championship of little          kids baseball.  But right before          the game, the second best player on          the team was suspended because he          played a prank on a nice man who          owned a book store... When that boy          grew up he was convicted on          burglary charges and spent fifteen          years in prison -- where he          belongs.Isaac didn't understand that last part.                    MAURICE          Anyway, Big Billy needed another          player so he yelled into the          stands.  'Who can play baseball?'          And there was a little voice that          yelled out, 'Me, I can play.'          Everyone turned to see a little boy          standing with a glove.                    ISAAC              (beaming)          That's me.                    MAURICE          Right.  But everyone saw how small          Isaac was and laughed... but not          Big Billy.  He stared at Isaac          carefully and then told him to join          the game.  It came to the end of          the game.  It was the eleventh or          twelfth inning or whatever is the          last inning of a game...                    ISAAC          Nine.                    MAURICE          Okay nine.  Big Billy's team was          losing and he was on base.  That's          when Isaac came up.  He could          barely hold the bat... Big Billy          winked at Isaac... The ball was          pitched -- Isaac hit the ball hard.          It soared up and out over the          stadium.  Everyone cheered.  Isaac          hit a home run and won the game.          After the game, Isaac asked Big          Billy why he let he play.  Big          Billy smiled and said, I wasn't          always Big Billy, I was Little          Billy first... Isaac and Big Billy          went off after the game and read a          classic book together.  The end.                    ISAAC          You know what -- that was a really          good story... Tell it again.Maurice has to smile as Isaac looks up anxiously.

Max can sense something big is happening.The Caldwell clan, one and all has gathered at the end oftheir driveway.  Maurice is escorted out by Isaac who clingstightly to his hand.  Mr. Caldwell meets Maurice halfway andpulls him aside.                    MR. CALDWELL          That's a nice watch.Maurice looks down at his beat-up Seiko.                    MR. CALDWELL          I've always wanted a watch like          that.                    MAURICE              (unstrapping it)          It's yours.                    MR. CALDWELL          No.  I won't take it unless I pay          for it... Let's see, that's a          pretty nice watch -- I can see          that.Maurice watches him suspiciously as he pulls out an envelopefrom his jacket pocket.                    MR. CALDWELL          Let's say I give you what's in this          envelope for that beautiful watch.Maurice is handed the envelope.  He opens it to find a thickPILE OF CASH, TENS AND TWENTIES.                    MR. CALDWELL          I really want that watch.                    MAURICE          This isn't right.                    MR. CALDWELL          This is my only chance to get a          watch like that.  It would mean a          lot to me and my family.  Please          take it.  It really isn't that          much.Maurice stares into the envelope emotionally and hands overthe watch tentatively.                    MAURICE          This is a loan.Mr. Caldwell straps on the watch and then hugs Maurice.The rest of the family say their good-byes.Isaac won't let go of Maurice's hand as he walks out into thestreet.                    MR. CALDWELL          Isaac, come back here.Isaac just holds on tighter.  After Maurice and Isaac havewalked a few steps out into the street, Maurice kneels down.                    MAURICE          I have to go now.Isaac's bottom lip protrudes as he tries not to cry.  Mauricehas to hold back a few tears himself.  He hugs Isaac tightly.                    MAURICE              (whispers)          Why didn't I meet you fifteen years          ago?Maurice pulls away from Isaac slowly.  Isaac runs to hismother's arms.

It stabilizes there.Maurice unaware of his precarious situation sleeps twentyfive feet above the ground.                                                  CUT TO:MID-DAYAnother sizzler.  Temperatures in the nineties.  The sun isdirectly overhead.Maurice stirs in his sleep, moving closer to the edge of therock.A STEADY STREAM OF SAND POURS FROM THE CRACK...A SLIGHT TREMOR...THEN THE FRIGHTENING SOUND OF ROCK MOVING AGAINST ROCK...Maurice wakes up as he begins to slide off... Hands scrapingat the dirt... He SLIDES OFF THE ROCK... Feet and handsdesperately trying to cling to the hillside... He picks upspeed as he tumbles down... Maurice looks down in time to seea small jut in the rock hurtling towards him... no time forpanic... SLAM!  A SICKENING CRACK OF BONE as Maurice HITS therock square in the ribs... Maurice flops down the rest of theslope like a rag doll... he comes to rest in the dirt,clutching his ribs.  The sun beats down on his stunned eyes.Maurice stares up at the dizzying slope.  Sand stilltrickling down to a stop.  He doesn't try to move for thefirst few seconds.  His breathing increasingly erratic.Maurice drags himself to sit upright.  The sharp painscausing a distorted grimace on his face.  A short rest,before working his way to his feet.                                                  CUT TO:HIGHWAYMaurice uses a highway guardrail as a backrest.  He takes aseat in the dirt.  Maurice's hair is damp with sweat.  Hisbreathing relegated to slow gasps.  His left hand coveringhis rib cage protectively.  Blood begins to trickle throughthe spaces between his fingers.Maurice closes his eyes for a moment, before his bent leggoes into spasms... Maurice is forced to straighten the leginstantly... jarring his tender rib cafe... Maurice clings tothe back of his thigh... Maurice is defeated... On the vergeof tears.He glances way down the road and spots a TINY CLOUD OF SMOKEmiles away in the distance.  A car is moving in hisdirection.Maurice looks up into the DAZZLING WHITE SKY.  Drops of sweatfalling into his eyes.                    MAURICE              (whisper)          It's over Ellen... I failed you          again.Maurice looks down the road at the cloud of dust growinglarger.                    MAURICE          I tried Ellen, I really tried... I          don't have the strength.The cloud is now clearly a car... Maurice stares up into thesky again... The tears racing the sweat down his cheeks.Maurice YELLS TO THE HEAVENS.                    MAURICE          You said I would never be alone!...          You promised...              (his yelling turns to               sobs)          ... You promised.Maurice's is interrupted by A SLIGHT RUSTLING BEHIND HISHEAD.  Maurice turns and looks through his tears...There, a few feet from him, perched quietly and majesticallyon the guardrail is a GOLDEN EAGLE.  It stands two and halffeet tall.  It spreads it's great wings.  The feathers expandlike a blanket, spanning six feet, and throwing a gentleshade on Maurice's face.Maurice is frozen in wonder.  The MAGIC of the moment glowsin his eyes.  Maurice's face gains life... The dark featheredeagle stands like a god before Maurice.  The moment isbreathtaking.                                                  CUT TO:ROADThe car on the road, takes the last quarter mile inseconds... SCREECHING IT'S BRAKES at the sight of Maurice onthe side of the road.Maurice turns away from the bird as the car pulls up.  Thedriver gets out and calls over the hood.                    DRIVER          Hey, man are you okay?Maurice's face filled with strength.  He grins through thepain.                    MAURICE          I'm fine.                    DRIVER          What the hell are you doing out          here?  You need a ride somewhere?                    MAURICE          No thank you.The driver is concerned.  He opens the driver door.                    DRIVER          You by yourself?Beat.                    MAURICE          No.This pacifies the driver somewhat.  He nods and gets in thecar.  Maurice watches as the car pulls away.He turns back to the guardrail -- the eagle is gone.  Mauricelooks up into the sky.  The Golden Eagle is flyingoverhead... a tiny dot against the blazing sun.Maurice struggles to his feet using the guardrail as support.Maurice takes his first step...                                             DISSOLVE TO:EXT.  SUBURBAN STREET - DAYSuburbia.  Rows of similar houses with small lawns and custommailboxes.  Beautiful trees line the streets creating acanopy over the roadway.Two women sit on a swing on the front porch of a smallsuburban home.  JANIS AND AMMIE'S conversation is cut in midsentence.                    JANIS          Who is that?                    AMMIE          I don't know.

Images come in and out of focus... twowomen walking towards him... Maurice clutches his head as thetrees start to swim faster -- color, lights, houses...

NURSE (O.S.)          Good morning Mr. Parker.Maurice turns his head to the side.  A pretty woman in herlate twenties, with LARGE LOCKS OF BROWN HAIR smiles back.This is STEPHANIE.                    STEPHANIE          There are a lot of people worried          about you.                    MAURICE              (softly)          Where am I?                    STEPHANIE          In a hospital.                    MAURICE          Which hospital?  Did you take me          back?Stephanie understands his worry.                    STEPHANIE          You are in St. Vincent's Hospital          in Roseville California.  You've          been here three days.Maurice closes his eyes in relief.                    MAURICE          Thank God.                                                  CUT TO:INT.  HOSPITAL - AFTERNOONThe room is crowded.  Maurice is now propped up in a seatedposition.  He tries to digest a set of fish sticks on a tray.                    MAURICE          I can't believe you're here.  I'm          touched.Maurice looks across to ADELLE AND GERALD.                    MAURICE          Are you two planning kids?                    ADELLE          Maybe later.                    MAURICE          You should definitely have          children.  They're really special.Adelle and Gerald are in shock.  Maurice forks another fishstick with a smile.                    ADELLE          I don't think you realize how          serious this is Uncle.                    MAURICE          How serious is it?DR. RAY, who has been standing by the window listening, stepsforward.                    DR. RAY          You have two broken ribs, a          punctured spleen and Acute          Rheumatoid Arthritis.Maurice gives a comforting smile to Adelle.                    DR. RAY          The normal amount of build up in          your arteries has been aggravated          by over exertion.  This is called,          "Claudication,"  As a result, there          isn't enough circulation to your          body.  That accounts for the          discoloration in your extremities          and the muscle spasms I'm sure          you've encountered.                    MAURICE          Can it kill me?                    DR. RAY          It can, but it'll have to wait in          line.This surprises Maurice.                    DR. RAY          We ran a C.T. and an M.R.I.  We          found bleeding in your brain.  Your          collapse was caused by "Transient          Cerebral-Ischemia"... a sudden loss          of blood circulation to the brain.          In other words, Mr. Parker, you had          a mild stroke.There is dead silence in the room.                    MAURICE              (scared)          I suppose I over did it.Adelle moves over to Maurice's side and holds his hand.                    MAURICE          What steps do we take now?                    DR. RAY          We operate.  We find the artery in          the brain and close the bleeding...          I just did this procedure on a          Senator and he's doing fine.                    MAURICE          What are the odds?  Do I have a          fifty-fifty chance of surviving the          operation?                    DR. RAY          It's hard to say.  It's a delicate          surgery.  There's no getting around          the fact that it's a very high-risk          situation.Adelle strokes Maurice's hair.  Maurice stares down at hisfood before looking up with great resolve.                    MAURICE          Then it'll have to wait until I          finish.                    ADELLE          What?                    MAURICE          I finish the walk, and then we may          take all the chances we want.The room is stunned.  Adelle gets off the bed and collectsherself.                    ADELLE          Listen to me very carefully,          because I don't want you to          misunderstand me... The walk is          over Uncle Maurice.  Done.          Finished.  You've made it to          California, it was a miracle, now          let's try to save your life.                    MAURICE              (louder)          I'm completing the walk.  I'm          almost there.                    DR. RAY          Okay, Maurice keep it calm...              (beat)          We can talk about this again, but          just so you know, we have a guard          on this floor who's sole job it is          to keep an eye on you.Maurice is crushed.                    DR. RAY          There are a lot of people out there          who would like to see you finish,          including me, but I'm not willing          to put your life in anymore risk          than it is... We do the operation,          and when you're better, you finish          the walk.The room is dead again.  Maurice drowns in his thoughts.                                                  CUT TO:INT.  HOSPITAL CHAPEL - AFTERNOONA small chapel.  Stain glass windows overlooking the parkinglot.  Maurice sits in his wheel chair at the back of theroom.  A few other patients are scattered in the four smallpews.Maurice has his hands folded tightly and stares up at thestatue of Mary.  His concentration is broken as a man in afull black suit and black shirt sits next to him.  Mauricenods at the priest.                    PRIEST          Hello, Mr. Parker.                    MAURICE          Hello.                    PRIEST          How are you feeling?                    MAURICE          Confused.  I'm not sure what to do          now.  I'm not sure what he wants          for me.                    PRIEST          He wants to reward you... That's          why I'm here.                    MAURICE              (a little confused)          What do you mean?                    PRIEST          I mean you've done a great thing.          You should be rewarded monetarily.Maurice is lost.                    PRIEST          What's your shoe size?                    MAURICE          What?  Who are you?The priest reaches into his jacket -- for the first time WESEE a Polo design on his shirt and a gaudy gold chain aroundhis neck.                    PRIEST          Clive Silver -- Marketing Executive          at Reebok.Maurice stares at the card in disbelief.                    CLIVE          We want you to do some spots for          us.                    MAURICE          What the hell is this?Some of the patients turn around.                    CLIVE          I'm talking six figures, pay or          play -- for two spots.  We want to          push a new line with you...          America's New Hero.Maurice is flustered.  He can't take this.  His eyes becomedesperate.Clive waves his hands in the air excitedly.                    CLIVE          Imagine grainy black and white          shots of long stretches of highway          -- quick cuts with a slow pounding          beat underneath... Then we see a          man walking up a steep incline --          it's you Maurice.  We see shots of          you walking.  Cut.  Cut.  Cut.          Fast... Music crescendoes -- Bham!          Close up -- and you say...          'Reebok, Because There's Nothing          You Can't Do.'Clive finishes.  He is surprised to find Maurice in tears.Clive is thrown totally off as Maurice stares at him angrilythrough streaming tears.                    MAURICE          My wife is dead.Maurice continues his powerful gaze until Clive looks away.Clive gathers his things and leaves the chapel withoutanother word.  Maurice drops his head into his hands andcries quietly.                                                  CUT TO:INT.  HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHTA change of shifts.  Stephanie gathers her things.

She leaves the room a little disappointed.WE MOVE CLOSER TO THE BED.  We see Maurice laying still --the battered photo of Ellen clutches to his chest.

They move through the doorsmarked "Visitor's Area."Maurice stretches a huge grin as KRIS REDDY gets up from achair.  Kris bends down and hugs Maurice emotionally.

MAURICE          Adelle told me, your writing is          going well.  The Crusader for          social issues and all.                    KRIS          You were right.

There's a sign          over the wood -- "Office space          available."The loss is evident on Maurice's eyes.                    MAURICE          I haven't been too punctual with          the rent.                    KRIS          I was thinking you could open          another store with investors.  I'm          sure a lot of people would want to          get involved with you now.Maurice forces a smile.                    MAURICE          Actually, I'm not worried about my          career right now... I'm more          worried about how you're getting me          out of here?Beat.

MAURICE          What, come on?                    KRIS          I can't do it.  I want you to          finish, but I want you to live          more.Maurice sits back straight.  He looks upset.                    MAURICE          We do the operation after I finish.          I can't risk not finishing... I          thought you understood what I was          doing.                    KRIS          I do.

To look me in the eye and say          what's important to you isn't as          important to me?  To tell me you          know what's best?  To tell me life          is more precious than what I feel          for my wife?Kris gets very emotional.  He rises from this chair.                    KRIS          Mr. Parker, you can yell at me, if          it'll help.  But I'm not risking          your life.                    MAURICE          It's mine to risk.Maurice turns to the window away from Kris.                    KRIS          Your operation is scheduled for          Friday.  I'll be back before then.Kris walks to the door and stops.                    KRIS          She knows you love her Mr. Parker.          She knows now.                    MAURICE              (not looking at Kris)          No more words.  Until I touch the          ocean with my hands... it's all          just words.Kris is tortured.

His eyes lock on the EXIT SIGN over thedoor at the end of the hall.  His eyes scan the area quickly.He immediately finds the guard on the floor staring at him.The guard nods ever so slightly as if to say, "I know whatyou're thinking."  Maurice turns his attention to a small boyin a hospital gown, being scolded by a head nurse.                    HEAD NURSE          You cooperate with us about taking          your medicine and maybe we'll talk          about candy.The head nurse takes a chocolate bar out of the boy's tinyhands.  The boy offers no response.  Maurice watchescuriously as STEPHANIE walks over and pats the boys head.Maurice catches a small exchange -- Stephanie slips anothercandy bar into his pocket.  The boy breaks into a warm smile.Stephanie puts her fingers against her lips and winks.Maurice takes this exchange in with great interest.

ADELLE          Let me tell you a story Sergeant.          There was a patient of mine who had          a Golden Retriever, Mac... She          loved Mac, not like a pet, but like          a family member.  One day, she had          to leave Mac with 'friends', and          wouldn't you know it, Mac gets away          and ends up falling into a sewer.          My patient comes back -- goes nuts          when she hears that Mac has been in          the sewer for over 48 hours.          Apparently the cop who found the          dog didn't want to get his pants          dirty.  And neither did anyone          else.  So of course, my patient          decides to go in after it... she          falls... breaks her hip and lands          next to her dead dog, who died of          toxic fumes down there...Adelle looks around at all the engrossed faces.

She has no Mac, no happiness, but          she's very rich now... That was a          dog.  We're talking about a human          being...
