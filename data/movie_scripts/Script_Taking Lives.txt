INSPECTOR LAVAL             Mr. Ford worked as a cruise-ship             musician. He would walk around             and play his guitar on the decks             at night.

Disguises. But that's not enough             for him, he has to be someone             else. He gets off impersonating             people.

To be seen, to be recognized, is a             horrifying thing to Asher. He has             no identity and wants it that way.

INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHTAsher drawing the sketch of who we now know was Hart.     Isthat a sly grin Asher has?                        GRACE (V.O.)

Evidence at the Ford crime scene             led to an apartment with more of             Hart's DNA. And evidence linking             Hart to Asher's crimes.

Mr. Hart, not Asher, murdered the             Montreal Inspector, correct?                           GRACE (V.O.)             Yes. Hart thought Costa was             systematically destroying his             life. Hart's violent explosion             was inevitable.                           SENIOR AGENT (V.O.)             How could Asher plan on Hart             snapping like that?                           GRACE (V.O.)             He couldn't. My guess is Asher             intended to kill Hart and make it             look like suicide. The             authorities would find the body             and close the Martin Asher file.INT.
