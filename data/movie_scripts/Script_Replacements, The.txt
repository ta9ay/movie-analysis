MARINA DEL REY - DAY       It's raining lightly in the harbor and the       water around the moored boats looks dirty and       cold.       We PICK UP a sad excuse for a boat sitting in       an end slip.       It's a sea-gull-shitcovered, thirtyfoot cabin       cruiser that hasn't cruised in a long, long       time. A ratty looking unpainted plywood       addition has been nailed to the top of the       cabin. It's partially covered with a blue       plastic tarp.       SUPERIMPOSE:   MARINA DEL REY, CALIFORNIA -       FALL       The tarp moves and SHANE FALCO's half-naked       torso emerges from under it. Shane is late       twenties, golden boy handsome, but quickly       going to seed. He looks hung over.       Shane glances up at the sky and rain. He       pulls on the top part of an old patched wet       suit and zips it up. He shivers.EXT. MARINA DEL REY HARBOR - DAYWe're BUZZING around the harbor with Shane inan old Zodiac inflatable DINGHY.Shane has pulled up the attached rubber hoodto his wet suit so that only the white, pastyoblong of his face is visible.It's still raining as he steers the littleboat around the sailboats and yachts.He pulls up to a fiftyfoot sailboat and CUTSthe ENGINE.With practiced moves, he ties the dinghy tothe rear rail of the sailboat and clips abill for services rendered on the sailboat'sstern line.He slips on a weight belt,    puts on a pair ofold gaffer taped goggles,    jams the end of aair-hose in his mouth, and    falls backward outof the dinghy and into the    water.EXT. UNDERWATER - DAYIt's dark, dirty and murky. Suddenly, Shanefloats INTO FRAME and comes AT us with a longspatula.ANOTHER ANGLEHe attacks the underside of the sailboatwhich is covered with green algae muck thathangs a foot off the bottom of the boat.The spatula scrapes away the green messrevealing the pure white underside of theboat.CLOSE ON SHANEAs he scrapes. Muck from the boat floatspast him. This doesn't look like fun.As he works, he happens to look down andnotices something on the bottom.SHANE'S POVAmidst the beer cans and other trash,something golden is sitting on the bottom.BACK TO SCENEShane takes a deep pull on his hose, lets itgo and drifts down.A shaft of sunlight penetrates the murkywater and reveals a broken trophy half-buriedin the mud. Shane kneels over it and picksit up.The trophy is almost a full-size footballrendered in bronze attached to a broken base.Shane turns "the ball" over in his hands. Hegrips the seams like he's done this before.Then he holds the football out in front ofhim.Suddenly, he starts barking garbled signalsto an imaginary offense. He turns to hisrunning back as he yells something like "Blue31!" It comes out in bubblesHe cocks his left leg and his wide receivergoes in motion.Then on the "snap" he turns and starts a fivestep drop.He moves in slow motion because hey... he'sunderwater! He executes a perfect playaction fake on the third step of his drop,and looks "down field" for his receivers.But there's a blitz! He steps up in thepocket but a linebacker's arm almost takeshis head off. He dodges, he bobs, he weavesin a kind of delicate ballet.He rolls left and keeps looking for the openman.Suddenly he points down field, pulls up andcocks his arm.The "ball" comes behind his ear and snapsforward in a perfect release.      The trophy spins OUT OF FRAME but we HOLD ON      Shane as he watches his pass. Suddenly, he      throws both arms up in a touchdown signal.      We STAY ON him as he freezes in this pose of      victory, fifteen feet underwater, on the      trash-covered, muddy bottom of Marina Del      Rey.         CUT TO:       EXT. EDWARD FRANCIS O'NEIL STADIUM (WASHINGTON,D.C.) -       DAY      Bam! A Miami Dolphin linebacker crushes a      Washington Redskin running back and lands on      his throat, elbow first.      It's a beautiful fall day in November and      Miami is beating the Skins in front of      seventy-six thousand crazed Washington fans.      The Redskins are at their home stadium better      known as "The Big O."      INT. CONTROL BOOTH - DAY      JOHN MADDEN and PAT SUMMERALL are calling the      game in shirtsleeves.                        SUMMERALL                That play, my friends,                sums up the Redskins'                running game all day                long. Now Washington                calls their last time                out.      Madden leans over to do his diagram that      shows up on your TV screen. We STAY ON him      as he draws and explains.                        MADDEN                Hey, the Dolphins do                this as good as                anybody. See, in a                four, three, two, two,                you got the guards...                boom!... Plugging up                the middle, then the                corners... boom and         boom!     Are free to         box...    leaving the         middle    linebacker to         cut off    the trap         here...    boom!                 SUMMERALL         Third and twenty-two,         but forget the first         down with eight seconds         showing and the Skins         down by a touchdown.                 MADDEN         Could be the last play.                 SUMMERALL         Could be the last play         of the season if the         players go out.EXT.

SUMMERALL         (V.O.)         Once again, if you         haven't heard, it was         announced during         halftime that the         N.F.L. Players         Association will hold a         press conference         immediately following         this game -- that would         make it about five         o'clock Eastern time --         and it is expected that            the players' union will            announce a strike            effective immediately.ON REDSKINETTESTwelve striking-looking women dressed inburgundy and gold are doing some inanechatter to a section of fans that ignorethem.The girls are led by pretty ANNABELLEFARRELL, a bundle of manic energy inside abody from heaven.                    MADDEN (V.O.)            It's all about money,            folks. More money, of            course and ain't it            always? The shame of            it is the big losers            are you out there, the            fans.ON MARTELThe Redskin quarterback moves to the huddle.                    SUMMERALL            (V.O.)            Here we go: Third            down, eight seconds to            play, ball on the            Dolphins' thirty-three            yard line. Skins down            by a touchdown.The huddle breaks and Martel sets up over thecenter.                    MARTEL            Green 48! Green 48!            Hut! Hut!The ball is snapped and Martel drops back.He looks for a receiver and doesn't seeanybody.He steps up in the pocket, sees an openingand takes off running down field.                   MADDEN (V.O.)          There goes Martel!Martel is a pretty good broken field runnerfor a big guy. Plus with the defensecovering every possible receiver, he's got alot of daylight.Nobody has touched him as he crosses thefifteen. Suddenly, a safety, smaller thanMartel, looms in front of him at the ten.Martel goes down in one of those wimpyquarterback slides before the safety can evenhit him.BANG!   The GUN sounds and the game is over.ON MADDEN AND SUMMERALLThey look at each other in disbelief                  SUMMERALL          Well... Martel goes          down ten yards short of          a score.                  MADDEN          On maybe the last play          of the season.                  SUMMERALL          I think he might have          slipped.                  MADDEN          Yeah, there's a lot of          that going around.ON THREE REDSKIN FANSWe'll see these guys throughout. They'retypical low level Washington bureaucratsnamed TODD, ROD and BOB who live for the Hogs-- the traditional name for the Redskinoffensive linemen.Todd is shirtless and his entire upper bodyis painted Redskin red.At that moment, they are livid with theirquarterback and Bob is speaking for them all.                    BOB         We're    coming to your         house    tonight, and         we're    gonna fucking         kill    you!

AUGUSTINE         Nice medicine for a         loss. Keeps us calm.         Makes us not so sad.         Keeps us on an even         keel. Gives us some         perspective, doesn't         it?

A place kicker         over a punter.                 BANES         The thinking being that         if we lose the toss, we         have to be able to at         least kick off.Both coaches laugh nervously.     McGintydoesn't say anything.                 PILACHOWSKI         Okay. Here's the list         of every player cut         this past season. What         we would like to do         is...                  McGINTY                 (interrupting)         Those people?                (pointing to         list)         Most of them were cut         because they were         shitty.McGinty takes out a piece of paper of his ownwith a bunch of names on it.                 McGINTY         We're going to go         another way here. I've         done some scouting         since I retired. On an         ad hoc basis, of         course. And what I         have here is a list of         people I've kept an eye         on. They've all played         football somewhere, but         only a few in the pros.         And they've all got         something... unique to         bring to the game.         We're gonna take these         people and try to put         together a winning         team. And if nothing         else, they should be         fun to watch.McGinty looks up when he senses someonestanding in the doorway. It's REESE EVANS,the veteran Redskin we saw standing on thesidelines with the clean uniform.                 EVANS         You won't need a         center.                 McGINTY         How you doin', Reese?                 EVANS         Bored and ready to         retire. I'm just         looking for one more         hit. One more really         good hit.                 McGINTY         What about the strike?                 EVANS         Hell, I'm rich. I got         no complaint with         Mister O'Neil. I just         want a chance to play         one last time.                 (MORE)                 EVANS (CONT'D)         Shit, I'd rather go out         with a broken leg than         sitting on the bench.McGinty nods to Pilachowski. The coach takesa marker and fills in "Evans" in the centercircle.                 McGINTY         Welcome to the new         Washington Redskins.                (to his coaches)         Let's find Reese         somebody to play with.  CUT TO:INT. METHAMPHETAMINE LAB - DAYA bunch of BIKER types are cooking up a vatof speed.

EQUIPMENT ROOM - DAYSID, an oldtimer equipment man folds towels.Behind him, we can see helmets, pads, etc.McGinty walks up dragging Shane who is fullydressed in a uniform, including helmet.                   McGINTY                  (to Sid)           What is this?McGinty points to the intricate face guard onShane's helmet.It's an exaggerated version of a lineman'scage with so much metal criss-crossing thatyou can hardly see Shane's face.                   McGINTY           He's a quarterback!           How is he supposed to           see?                   SID           He told me he was a           linebacker!                   SHANE           I can see.McGinty holds up three fingers.                   McGINTY           How many fingers?                    SHANE           Two.   No, wait.    Three.  CUT TO:EXT. FIELD - DAYAndre and Jamal are hitting the blocking sledsimultaneously. They drive it OUT OF FRAME.ON SHANEHe's now wearing a helmet with a twobarquarterback face guard. He takes a snap andpitches out to running back Roland Lamont.Roland, now wearing a big knee brace, lookssharp as he cuts to the outside.ON PILACHOWSKIThe offensive coordinator is standing withMcGinty who is concentrating on thescrimmage. Suddenly, Pilachowski spotssomeone. His mouth drops open.ON MICKEY LEEHe's a fourhundred-fifty-pound ex-Sumowrestler crammed into a Redskin uniform.     Fatrolls are visible everywhere.                 PILACHOWSKI         Oh my God. That's         disgusting!Lee walks up. McGinty bows and sayssomething in Japanese. Lee bows and answersback in Japanese. Then they shake hands.                 McGINTY         How you doin', Mickey?                 LEE         Not bad, Coach.                 McGINTY         You look great. Why         don't you work out at         left tackle?                 LEE         You got it.Lee puts on his helmet, pulls his ponytailout the back and rumbles away.Pilachowski is looking at McGinty like he'scrazy.                 PILACHOWSKI         You're not serious.                 McGINTY         I met Mickey in Hawaii.         When he was even         bigger. He's a Sumo         wrestler. That means         he's an expert at         pushing people around.         That's what pass         blocking is, Leo.Defensive coordinator Christopher Banes comesrunning up in a lather.                 BANES                (to McGinty)         I got a defensive end         who's deaf!!                 PILACHOWSKI                (watching Lee         walk                 away)         I'll trade you for a         tackle who's gonna play         in a diaper.                 BANES         How can I coach a deaf         man?!                 McGINTY         You don't have to...He looks across the field at a big, good-looking kid named BRIAN MURRAY who is in themiddle of a pass rushing drill.Murray looks really fast, especially for hissize.                 McGINTY         Brian Murray would have         gone in the first round         five years back if he         hadn't been born deaf.         I first saw him play         right here in D.C. for         Galludet College. He's         a hell of an athlete.         You won't have to tell         him anything.                 BANES         I can't believe it! I         got to be able to         communicate with him.                 McGINTY         Then learn to sign.         Hey, look at it this         way: He'll never get           pulled off sides on an           audible.McGinty thinks this is funny as shit.ON SHANEHe's just done a fivestop drop on a passplay. He's looking down field when he seessomething scary.                   SHANE           Oh shit! No!He throws the ball away and then is nailedand taken down on his back by Bateman(psychotic cop).Shane groans and lies there with Bateman ontop of him.                   BATEMAN           Hi, I'm Danny.                     SHANE                    (groaning)           Shane.McGinty pulls Bateman up.                   McGINTY           Nice pop, Danny.                   BATEMAN           Thank's, Coach!Danny runs off.                   SHANE           What was that?                   McGINTY           Danny Bateman. Ex-cop,           ex-Marine, ex-rugby.           He's absolutely           harmless, if you just           play dead.McGinty helps Shane up.                   McGINTY           San Diego used you all           wrong. You're not a            drop back passer.            You're a scrambler.            Like you were in            college. So, we're            gonna roll out. A lot.            Get used to setting up            on the run. You'll            live a lot longer.                    SHANE            I'm very interested in            that.     CUT TO:PRACTICE MONTAGEA)    BATEMAN      is lined up at middle linebacker. When      the play starts, he runs headlong into      four blockers and takes them all down      with him.B)    WIDE RECEIVER CLIFFORD FRANKLIN      beats his man, and turns as Shane,      rolling out to his left, puts the ball      right on his numbers. Franklin drops it.C)    ANDRE AND JAMAL      On the snap, they pull to lead a sweep.      Unfortu-nately, each thinks the play is      to their side. They forearm each other      and then get into a fight.D)    LOU PACIFICO      boots one from thirty-five yards through      the uprights. He smiles, takes out a      Marlboro Light and a Bic and fires up.E)    CLIFFORD FRANKLIN      pulls up, does a button hook and Shane      puts the ball in his hands. Franklin      drops it.F)    LEE      the Sumo guy, hits the blocking sled and      turns it over.G)   BATEMAN     is down on the ground viciously punching     another player as two assistants try to     pull him off.H)   FRANKLIN     is in a crossing pattern in the end zone.

ANNABELLE          I saw your second          concussion. The one         against Cleveland.         Pow! You could hear it         in the cheap seats.         But you completed the         pass. That's what         counts.                 SHANE         I guess so.                 ANNABELLE         If there's anything you         need, let me know. And         I mean anything, okay?

You've got to catch the         ball, son. This is the         main idea of the         passing game.                 CLIFFORD         I know, Coach, I know.                 McGINTY         Okay.

ROLAND           Actually, less than two           minutes. I was a           rookie third round pick           in '93. We were           playing Atlanta in the           home opener. Near the           end of the first           quarter, they sent me           in, I took a screen           pass over the middle           and got hit by both           linebackers.           Simultaneously. One a         side. My knee turned         into wet toilet paper.         End of career.

BANES         Where did you play,         Judge? Wait. Do I         call you judge?                 JUDGE         Your Honor, or Judge is         fine. I played at         Harvard. But I played         in the days when you         went both ways.         Offense and defense.         When players were         really tough.                (to Wilkinson)         And where did you play         college ball... I'm         sorry, what was your         name again?Wilkinson is smiling but he looks dangerous.                 WILKINSON         Smith. Ray Smith. I         played at a junior         college nobody ever         heard of. What         position did you play         on defense, Judge?                 JUDGE         Middle linebacker.                 WILKINSON         Yeah, big fellow like         you, that's what I         would have guessed.                 JUDGE         It was a different game         in those days. Raw.         Powerful. No tricks,         like today.                 WILKINSON         You know, maybe you can         show me some of your         technique, Your Honor.         Maybe you can show me         some of that toughness.                 JUDGE         I'd be glad to!There's an evil glint in Wilkinson's eye.INT. McGINTY'S HOUSE - DAYShane is standing alone in a large hallwaylooking at an enormous trophy case stuffedwith the spoils of football.                 ANNABELLE         (O.S.)         You would think he's         done enough.Shane turns and sees her.    She's as fetchingas ever.                 ANNABELLE         McGinty, I mean.                 SHANE         I was kind of thinking         the same thing.                 ANNABELLE         My theory is he came         out of retirement to         see if he could win         with losers.                (pause)         Oh, shit. I'm sorry.         I didn't mean...                 SHANE                (interrupting)         Hey, it's okay. I've         been called worse.                    ANNABELLE         Like    after that Sugar         Bowl    game? I guess you         could    survive anything         after    that.Shane has to actually smile at this.                 SHANE         Sometimes I feel like         everybody in the world         saw that game. Like I         could go to India and         some little guy would         run up to me and say,         'Boy, did you suck in         the '92 Sugar Bowl.'Annabelle laughs.                 SHANE         So, how come you're         such a fan?                 ANNABELLE         My dad. He's a huge         Redskin fan. For         years. He's in his         twenty-ninth year at         the Senate Office         Building. As a guard,         not a senator. The         only thing that keeps         him going he says, is         me and the Redskins.         That's where I get it.         My fan-ness.                (suddenly)         Are you scared?Shane is totally taken off guard by thiswoman.                     SHANE         Scared? Well... yes.         Absolutely.                 ANNABELLE         It's okay. Anybody         would be. But you're         good. And you'll do         good.                 SHANE         Well, thank you. Look,         I gotta study the play         book tonight. So...         I'll see you.                 ANNABELLE         Break a leg tomorrow.                    SHANE         What?!                    ANNABELLE         It's    from the theater.         For    opening night. You         say    the worst thing         that    can happen. And         it won't.   Break a leg.Shane waves uncertainly and walks away.EXT. McGINTY'S BACK YARD - DAYThe Judge (now with his jacket off) andWilkinson are lined up across from each otherin a three-point stance in something called aman maker drill.The entire team forms two lanes on eitherside of them, as they face off.The idea is to knock the other guy down andget by him.                 JUDGE         Alright, this is how we         used to stop a running         back.                 WILKINSON         I can't wait.Someone says hut! And Wilkinson slams intothe Republican 16th Circuit Court Judge andknocks him head over heels.The Judge lands on his back, wham!   He's outcold.Wilkinson slaps hands with Andre and Jamal.                 WILKINSON         Oooh... got me a judge!         Man, that felt good!  CUT TO:EXT. BIG O STADIUM - DAYIt's another beautiful fall afternoon andcars are entering the stadium parking lot.At one of the entrances, the strikingRedskins are picketing. Jerome Lindell (NFLPlayers President) is still marching withthem.A little boy stops one of the Redskins andasks for an autograph on a program. Theplayer gives it to him and the kid walksaway.Lindell runs after the kid, grabs the programand rips off the page the player signed.                 LINDELL                (to kid)         Don't be asking    for no         autographs from    the         real players and    then         go in and watch    the         scabs!The kid retreats quickly.    Lindell rips upthe page.                 LINDELL                (to the player)         That is not the message         we want to send our         children!  CUT TO:INT. LOCKER ROOM - DAYIt's very quiet. Shane sits in pads and nojersey, methodically squeezing a football.Reese Evans, his center, stops by.                 EVANS         You okay?Shane nods and gives a nauseous-lookingsmile.                 EVANS         Remember to nod your         head on the snap.                 SHANE                (out of it)         Nod my head?                    EVANS         For    when Murray's in.         The    deaf kid. Hello?         He    needs to look at you         on    the snap.Shane nods that he understands but he goesback to staring at a wall.Andre and Jamal sit facing each other. Andrethrows a vicious forearm at Jamal's head butJamal catches it. They both nod in approval.Lou Pacifico smokes and stares.Bateman is leaning against a wall, fullydressed, helmet on. He's staring into spaceand smiling to himself. He looks terrifying.Earl Wilkinson (the criminal) is polishing abeautiful pair of new alligator shoes.Clifford Franklin looks at himself in themirror as he ceremoniously puts on hishelmet.Walter Cochran is reading his Bible in frontof his locker, which features a picture ofJesus and a cross.Mickey Lee (ex-sumo) is sitting in front of abowl of hard boiled eggs. He's methodicallypopping them into his mouth. He eats four aswe watch.Coach Pilachowski comes up to Lee and watcheshim eat.                 PILACHOWSKI         What are you, crazy?         Nobody eats right         before a game.                 LEE         I always ate before a         big match. I need the         bulk.Like a hole in the head he needs the bulk.Coach McGinty comes strolling through thelocker room, the picture of calm.He walks by defensive end/tight end BrianMurray and signs to him to have a good game.Murray signs back, "Thanks, Coach."Cochran spots McGinty and puts down hisBible.                 COCHRAN         Coach McGinty, I'd like         to lead the team in the         pregame prayer.                 McGINTY         No. No praying.         That's the problem with         professional sports         today: too much god         damn praying. Five         hundred dollar fine to         the first man I hear         praying.McGinty turns and bums an egg from Mickey andwalks to the middle of the locker room.He eats the egg as he turns slowly and takesin his players.                 McGINTY         A lot of people are         waiting for you to fall         on your asses today.         And guess what? You're         going to. But I don't         give a shit if you look         funny out there. Or if         you miss a block, or         drop a pass, or trip         over your own dick.         This is professional.         And the difference         between professional         and amateur, between         playing for the         Washington Redskins and         Michigan State is         simply... money. You         are being paid to win.         Not just to play. Not         just to learn how to be         good sports. Not for         the alumni. You are         being paid to win. I         don't care how the fuck         you do it. But I'm         demanding it. Because         those guys whose place         you're taking have         forgotten that simple         fact. So, go win it.He walks away.   The players get up and startmoving.  CUT TO:EXT. BIG O - DAYWe're FOCUSED ON an enormous,    plastic blow-upWashington Redskin helmet that    bobs on theground in front of the exit to    the field.The idea is, the players will    run into andthen out of the helmet as they    areintroduced.Annabelle and her fellow twenty cheerleadersare lined up on either side of the bobbinghelmet, waiting for the players.ON MADDEN AND SUMMERALLThey are in their booth, vamping ON CAMERA.                  MADDEN          ... Pretty bold move by          New England Patriot          owner Victor Kiam, who          went out and bought an          entire semi-pro team          once the strike          happened.                  (MORE)                  MADDEN (CONT'D)          Redskin management, on          the other hand, is          going with a bunch of          unknowns. Their public          relations people don't          even have bios yet on          most of their players,          although we'll see one          or two familiar faces          out there today.                  SUMMERALL          Like Shane Falco, the          enormously talented          college quarterback          from Ohio State, who          never fulfilled his          potential in the pro's.                 (to Madden)          Wow, remember that            Sugar Bowl Falco            quarterbacked when            Florida State creamed            them?                    MADDEN            Oh, yeah, they were            absolutely decimated!                    SUMMERALL            Dusted. And if I'm not            mistaken, Falco set a            record in that game for            Bowl interceptions.            Anyway, for some of            these players this is            another shot; a last            shot, probably, for a            guy like Falco...  CUT TO:INT.

I think the Redskins              just set a record for              penalties in the first              three minutes. We're              waiting for the stats              on that...Here come the Patriots again.     CUT TO:FIRST HALF MONTAGEA)    SHANE      rolls to his right but the blitz    is on      and he reverses and rolls left.     He's      finally cornered and has to dump    the ball      off. The pass is incomplete and     he's      knocked on his ass.B)    SHANE      fakes to Lamont and rolls again.     He      fires a bullet to Franklin on a    down and      out. Clifford actually catches     the ball,      then bobbles it and in trying to    get      possession again, hands the ball    to the      defender.      The defender can't believe it for a beat      and then he streaks down the sideline and      scores.C)    McGINTY      just shakes his head.D)    TODD, ROB AND BOB      scream in pain.

Shane dives for the guy and misses.   The     safety scores.H)   ANNABELLE     is trying desperately to get the crowd     into the game by jumping up and down and     waving her pom poms.

He's got it.But Bateman doesn't go down. He turns andstarts running across the field.Shane runs after him.                 SHANE         No! Danny, go down!         You're using up the         clock!But Bateman likes this new job: kick-offreturner! Especially after he runs over aGiant and stiff-arms another.Bateman is finally trapped on the farsideline after gaining perhaps eight yards.So, he turns and starts running back theother way.Shane has been chasing him and now seesBateman running back at him.Shane has no choice but to throw himself infront of Bateman's legs.Bateman goes down.Shane jumps up:                 SHANE                (to ref)         Time out!Bateman looks up at Shane.

The strike, now in its         second week, is         expected to go out with         a fizzle. Most experts         think that the Monday         night Dallas/Washington         game will be the last         with replacement         players. But even that         game will feature at         least 75 percent of the         regular Cowboys.

AL         Good evening from the         Big O here in         Washington D.C. where         the mighty Dallas         Cowboys take on the         Cinderella Washington         'Scabskins' as they         have come to be known.         Hi, I'm Al Michaels and         we are witnesses to a         unique matchup tonight         as Shane Falco and a         contingent of strike         players go up against         the entire regular         squad of the Dallas         Cowboys. Yes, you         heard right: every         Cowboy has now crossed         the picket line, some         as late as this         afternoon, and they         will all play tonight.         Can a rag tag group of         hasbeens and castoffs         stand up to what was         once called America's         team? And what about         the strike itself?

The strike is just         about history. By         tomorrow, you will no         longer be Redskins.         It's important that you         leave here, however,         with the knowledge that         you have made a         difference in your own         life, in the owner's         life -- or what's left         of it -- and especially         the fans'. You have         proven to a skeptical         America that sports is         not about contracts, or         agents or shoe deals.         Sports is about rising         to the occasion. We         have one more         opportunity tonight to         do that, one more         chance to show what         heart is all about.         The Dallas Cowboys are         waiting out there to         kill you. I expect         nothing less than for         you to win even in your         death throes. We have         a powerful weapon on         our side tonight:         there is no tomorrow         for most of you. And         that makes you very         dangerous people. Use         it.

It's true.Nobody says anything for a beat.                 FRANKLIN         I got to tell you,         Shane, you played the         first half like you         were staying. Like you         already had a contract.Shane looks around the room at this beatenbunch. No one makes eye contact with him.                 SHANE         You're right, Clifford.         And I'm sorry. But now         I want to go out there         and either beat these         bastards or die trying.         I never wanted to beat         anybody so bad in my         life.Everybody lets this sink in.Earl Wilkinson finally speaks up.                 EARL         I don't know what yawl         are doin' tomorrow, but         my ass is goin' back to         jail. But if I gotta         go, I want to go back a         winner.                 EVANS         Hell, I'm retiring. I         have thirty minutes of         football left in my         whole career. I'm         homicidal!                 BATEMAN         Me, too, Reese!                 EARL         Let's get it on!Everybody turns to Shane.                 SHANE         Gentlemen, our problem         is the Cowboys aren't         afraid of us. But they         should be!                 LAMONT         Damn straight!Everybody whoops!                 SHANE         We've got one chance on         offense to make our         stand -- the first play         of the half.                 JAMAL         One touchdown ain't         gonna help, Shane.                    SHANE         No.     But one nasty-ass         play    might. We just         gotta    be brave. And         trust    each other.Shane happens to glance at Pacifico.Pacifico won't meet his eye.Shane turns to Sid.

FIELD - NIGHTThe Cowboys are already back on the field asthe Redskins come out of their locker room.                  AL (V.O.)          ... at nine-forty          Eastern time, the          agreement was reached,          and except for this          upcoming second half,          the strike is history.ON AL, DAN AND BOOMERBoomer's tie is off and his shirt is torn.Dan looks guilty, but still angry.                  DAN          It's about time. I say          let the professionals          back on the field. The          fans deserve nothing          less.                  BOOMER          Yeah, you would say          that.ON BALLThe Dallas kicker puts the ball in the endzone for a touchback.ON SHANEHe starts to follow the offense out on thefield. Then he turns and sees Annabelleengrossed in a cheer.He runs over to her.                   ANNABELLE           Are you okay? Is it           your side?                   SHANE           I'm okay. I owe you an           apology.                      ANNABELLE           What?     You do?                   SHANE           Yes. I'll explain           later. But thank you           for believing in me.           You give me strength           just looking at you.And with that, Shane takes her in his armsand kisses her deeply.The crowd on that side of the field reacts tothe kiss with a "Wooooooo!"                   AL (V.O.)           Well, this is a first.           Shane Falco seems to           be...                      BOOMER (V.O.)           Hell,    Al, he's necking           with    a cheerleader!           I've    done a little of           that    in my time.                   DAN (V.O.)           The players are not           supposed to fraternize           with the cheerleaders.                   BOOMER (V.O.)           Hey, Dan, what are they            gonna do?   Fire him?!ON SHANEHe breaks the kiss and looks up in the standsat Eddie Martel.Shane gives him the finger.The crowd goes "Wooooo!" at that too.Martel doesn't think this is funny.Shane walks onto the field leaving a confusedbut happy Annabelle.He walks past Dallas defensive linemanButler.                    BUTLER            That wasn't too smart.                    SHANE            Suck my dick.Butler is too shocked for a comeback.ON HUDDLEIt breaks and Shane walks to the line ofscrimmage.                    AL (V.O.)            Here we go, first and            ten for the Redskins.            Twenty-four zip Dallas.We can see now that Wilkinson and Bateman arenow part of the offense.They line up as receivers opposite defensivehalfbacks. In fact, everyone but Shane is onthe line of scrimmage, paired up across froma cowboy.Shane leans over Reese and takes in theDallas defense.The Dallas MIDDLE LINEBACKER yells at Shane.                    LINEBACKER            Are you ready for more             pain, footsteps?Shane just smiles.                     SHANE             Blue thirteen! Blue             thirteen! Hut! Hut!

Butler     screams!B)   SHANE     throws the ball as hard as he can at the     middle Linebacker and hits him in the     crotch.

The defender screams and     falls down.D)   BATEMAN     gets a cornerback across from him in a     choke    hold. The guy can't breathe but     Bateman holds on.E)   WILKINSON     lifts up his defender's face guard and     connects with a right hand to the guy's     chin.F)   LEE     pulls the defensive lineman in front of     him to the ground. Then he falls on him.     The guy screams.ON FIELDAll across the line of scrimmage, Redskinsare punching, kicking and gouging the Dallasdefense.WHISTLES BLOW.   Flags fly everywhere.Most of the Dallas players are down andscreaming.Jamal stands across from a DEFENSIVE LINEMAN.He hasn't touched the guy. But he nods tothe player to look at his hand.The guy looks down just as Jamal flicks opena deadly-looking switchblade.The guy jumps back and yells:                 DEFENDER         He's got a knife!But there is so much confusion that nobodypays any attention. Jamal slips the knifeaway.                 AL (V.O.)         Whoa! Flags fly         everywhere! I've never         seen anything like         this!                 BOOMER (V.O.)         Unbelievable! One         Washington player had a         Cowboy in what appeared         to be a police choke         hold.                 DAN (V.O.)         I see at least five         flags... no six!The officials are going crazy trying     tofigure out the penalties as Shane and     theoffense back up and make room for the     Dallasmedical staff who come running out on     thefield.Some Dallas players are livid:                 BUTLER                (to the Ref)         He scratched my eyes         out!                    LINEBACKER            He hit me on purpose!ON McGINTYHe's smiling to himself on the sidelines.ON REFEREEHe faces the cameras, turns on his microphoneand sums up the penalties.

Unnecessary            roughness number 65 and            number 32, fifteen            yards... that's,            wait... forty-five...            no, thirty...

Hestops at the Redskin two-yard line and putsit down.IN HUDDLEShane leans in.                    SHANE            Okay, everybody, stick              together and don't take              any shit.

First and ten at the           Cowboy twenty and I'm           telling you, we are           looking at a totally           different team here in           the second half.                   BOOMER (V.O.)           Absolutely, Al. The           Redskins are playing           like there's no           tomorrow, because, hey,           there isn't!                   DAN (V.O.)           I gotta agree with you           on this one. The           surprising thing for me           is how ineffectual the           Cowboys have been in           this half. I mean,           they look totally           intimidated.                   AL (V.O.)           I love when you guys           agree.ON SHANEHe's in the shotgun calling signals.

Makes up for the           perfect ones they drop.                   DAN (V.O.)           Maybe not so lucky.

DISSOLVE TO:EXT. SIDELINE - DAYShane is sitting on the bench holding hishead and his side. He's talking quietly toMcGinty.ON WILKINSONHe's on the field calling for a fair catch.He makes it.                 AL (V.O.)         ... one minute twenty         remaining, and even         though Dallas didn't         score, they sure ate up         a lot of the clock.ANOTHER ANGLE - WILKINSONHe's leading the offense out onto the field.                 BOOMER (V.O.)         And it looks like Falco         cannot answer the bell.         He's still on the bench           and it    appears that           safety    Earl Wilkinson           will be    leading the           Redskin    offense.                   DAN (V.O.)           They just need to get           the ball in field goal           range.                   AL (V.O.)           And for Pacifico,           that's anything up to           sixty-five yards.ANOTHER ANGLE - WILKINSONHe takes the snap from the shotgun and keepsthe ball on a sweep. He plows for twelveyards.                   AL (V.O.)           That's good for twelve           yards. The clock stops           on the first down. The           Redskins have no time-           outs left.ON SHANEMcGinty is still bent over him.                   McGINTY           I need your hands in           there for the field           goal. I can't trust           Franklin to hold. He           almost dropped the           extra point.Shane is in major pain but nods his head.                   SHANE           I can do it.ON WILKINSONHe rolls again, but no one is open. Hecrosses the line of scrimmage, is hit andgoes down.ON CLOCKIt continues to run and passes twenty secondsas we watch.ON REDSKINSThey're hurrying back to the line ofscrimmage. Wilkinson stands over center.On the snap, Wilkinson throws the ball out ofbounds.                   AL (V.O.)           Wilkinson throws it           away, and with twelve           seconds remaining, the           Redskins will try a           forty-eight yard field           goal to tie it up.           That's almost a chip           shot for Pacifico.ON SHANEHe shakily follows Pacifico out onto thefield.Reese Evans catches up with him.

There are tears in his eyes.                   PACIFICO           I'm sorry. They know           where my family lives.Shane tries to digest what he just heard.
