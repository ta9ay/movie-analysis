THE BIG BLUE SKY - DAYA VIRGIN AIR 747 bursts through the clouds and levels off.INT. VIRGIN AIR 747 - DAYWe move through the FIRST CLASS CABIN. It's the regularmix of first class people: OLD MONEY in Gucci enjoyingfreshly baked cookies, a MILLIONAIRE in jeans and a T-shirt, BUSINESS PEOPLE relaxing after a tough day, and......a very nervous MAN.Shifty-eyed. Alone in an aisle seat, the emergency row.We hold on him for a moment, but not for too long. Thenwe continue moving into --THE COACH SECTIONStopping at the lavatory, the "OCCUPIED" sign switches to"VACANT" and...JAMES EARL JONES(or actually, a James Earl Jones type, who for ease ofdescription, we'll simply refer to as James Earl Jones)steps out of the restroom, in full African regalia:multi-colored dashiki, mufti (it's a kind of hat), theworks.

JAMES EARL JONES           Is this what you're looking for?She looks at it -- a little confused as to why he's justhanding it to her now -- but then she nods. As he passes:                         FLIGHT ATTENDANT           Oh, I'm sorry. Please. Is there           anything I can get you?                         JAMES EARL JONES           Scotch, blended.

PASQUAL                 (tentatively)          They say birds can't fly this high.                        JAMES EARL JONES          They say only angels can.Now Pasqual nods. Nervously begins to remove somethingfrom his pocket when they are interrupted by --                        FLIGHT ATTENDANT          Shall I pour your scotch?                        JAMES EARL JONES          No -- I'll take the bottle. Thank you.She hands him the airplane-sized bottle -- he waves offthe glass. She shrugs, leaving...Pasqual to resume what he was doing. Slowly, he removesa roll of Certs. He looks to Jones -- "Well? What aboutyour end of the bargain?"From within his dashiki, Jones pulls out a black velvetpouch. He hands it to Pasqual, who opens it to finddiamonds. A helluva lot of diamonds. Pasqual smiles.He hands the roll of Certs to Jones. It's not breathcandy at all, but a tiny roll of explosives, with a tiny,high-tech triggering mechanism.                        JAMES EARL JONES          Ah, c-5. The most dangerous          explosive material ever invented.          Hard to believe that this little          contraption could blow up ten city          blocks.                        PASQUAL          Be careful with it, huh?Both men smile.   Pasqual's very relieved that the deal isdone.Then suddenly, the lights blink out.Pasqual looks around, nervous. But it's just the in-flight movie beginning. Clouds, and a woman holding atorch.

Jones begins to let go of Pasqual, who SCREAMSand tries to clutch onto him, desperate.                        JAMES EARL JONES                 (over the rushing wind)          PULL YOURSELF TOGETHER.

Alex helps him with hisdashiki-chute, and then all three look up...Here comes Pasqual. Natalie whips the boat around,catching him as he helplessly drops into the seats, stillbound, still scared out of his wits.

BILTMORE BALLROOM - DAYA sophisticated reception is in full swing, an ocean ofsmart suits and power ties.Dressed as a catering waitress, Natalie carries a tray ofhors d'oeuvres. MOVING WITH her, we pass ROGER CORWIN, whotalks with another suit, and further on, a conservatively-dressed DYLAN who chats up a group of WALL STREET TYPES.                           DYLAN             The average investor sees technology             stocks as discrete entities, "This one is             up 50 points, this one is down 10." It's             only through derivative analysis that one             sees the real power of that sector.A few nods.    She makes a good point.                           BROKER GUY             Which analysis method do you prefer?On Dylan.    Shit.     She tries to stall...                           DYLAN             Well, there are so many options.
