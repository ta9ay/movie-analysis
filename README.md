## Analyzing movie ratings
The problem I'm trying to analyze is have movie ratings become more lenient over the decades. 
The MPAA rates each movie based on the explicit content in the movies. These movies get rated on a scale of discrete letter grades, like PG, G or R. My aim is to see if there has been a ratings creep, that is, do movies allow for more violence, sex and profanity as compared to similarly rated movies in the past. 

## Data
I'm using movie metadata, containing MPAA ratings, plot, script, and other things. I'm also using data froma  different rating agency, "Kids-In-Mind" that rates each movie on sctricter guidelines and has more descriptive scores as compared to the MPAA ratings.
