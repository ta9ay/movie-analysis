## Analyzing movie ratings
The Motion Picture Association (MPA) is an American trade association representing the five major film studios of the United States, as well as the video streaming services. One of its major duties is overseeing movie releases and rating the movies based on the film rating system managed by the Classification and Rating Administration (CARA). The main motivation behind this rating system is to help parents decide what films are appropriate for their children. The movies can be classified into one of 5 categories: G, PG, PG-13, R, NC-17. Each rating signifies a certain level of explicit/ mature content and is suitable for different audiences.<br>
Over the years, there have been complaints about the decreased stringency of the MPA ratings. Parents have complained about a ‘ratings creep’. In some ways, audiences feel that newer movies are more comfortable with including mature themes, strong language, and nudity. <br>
The goal of this project is to analyze this ratings creep through text analysis, and search for quantitative evidence about the decreased stringency of movie ratings.


## Data
I'm using movie metadata, containing MPAA ratings, plot, and other things. I'm also using data from a  different rating agency, "Kids-In-Mind" that rates each movie on sctricter guidelines and has more descriptive scores as compared to the MPAA ratings. <br>
The third dataset is a collection of movie screenplays (n=1093) (IMSDB, n.d.). A screenplay, or script, is a written work by screenwriters for a film, television show, or video games.
